   LPWASHINGTON -- The U.S. Federal Reserve began the long climb back from a historic period of cheap money by raising its short-term interest rate target to 1.25% from 1%.  

In a statement, the Fed suggested it will continue to raise the federal-funds rate a quarter-point at a time, saying it can move "at a pace that is likely to be measured." But it included a caveat that its policy makers "will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability." That is a warning that the central bank is apt to move to half-percentage point increases if inflation accelerates.  
   TDBoth the rate increase and accompanying statement were largely as markets expected, thanks to an unprecedented Fed effort to telegraph its plans over recent months and minimize any shock to the markets. It succeeded: Stock and bond prices barely reacted in the first half-hour after the announcement.  

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 17 points just before the announcement, ended the day up 22.05 points at 10435.48. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, 4.63% just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, ended the day at 4.59%, down from Tuesday's close of 4.69%.  

The Fed's action was as surprising as getting "a tie for Father's Day," UBS AG trader Art Cashin said on CNBC.  

The Fed noted that recent inflation readings were "somewhat elevated" but added that "a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors." It said risks to economic growth and inflation in coming months are balanced. "Output is continuing to expand at a solid pace, and labor-market conditions have improved," it said.  

All 12 voting members of the committee backed the increase in the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. In a related move, the central bank also raised its discount rate, charged on its short-term advances to commercial banks, by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%, acting on requests from all 12 reserve banks. Several commercial banks responded by raising their prime lending rates, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 4.25% from 4%.  

Economists consider a "neutral" funds rate -- which neither stimulates nor restrains the economy -- to be between 3% and 5%. Investors expect the funds rate to reach 2.25% by the end of this year, and 3.75% by the end of 2005.  

Having restated its plans to be "measured," even with a caveat, the Fed likely will be reluctant to raise rates more than a quarter-point at its next meeting on Aug. 10. Fed officials believe the credibility of their communications strategy depends on matching their words with actions. Abandoning "measured" rate increases right after reiterating the policy could weaken that credibility.  

But officials also realize that with inflation near the top of the 1% to 2% inflation zone they informally define as price stability, they have less margin for error than they hoped for a few months ago. Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure, excluding the more volatile food and energy components, is running at a 2.3% annual rate in the past six months.  

Indeed, while noting yesterday that a "portion" of the increase in inflation was transitory -- a likely refererence to higher commodity prices, which have eased a bit lately -- the Fed implied a portion also reflected changed economic fundamentals.  

Since the funds rate has a long way to go to reach neutral, the Fed would have to quickly switch to more aggressive rate hikes if it discovered it has been too sanguine about inflation. "We're one bad inflation number away" from the Fed having to raise interest rates by one-half a percentage point in August, instead of a quarter point, said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America.  

The Fed last raised the funds rate in May 2000, to 6.5%, to cool an economic boom fueled by a bubble in stocks and technology investment spending. Over the next three years it cut the rate 13 times to 1%, the lowest since 1958, first in response to those bursting bubbles, then to a wave of corporate-accounting and governance scandals and the buildup to the Iraq war, which restrained business confidence. As those traumas subsided and job creation took off in March after a year of stagnation, the case for easy policy rapidly melted away.  

Some critics worry the Fed has waited too long. The 12-month inflation rate, by the Fed's preferred measure, jumped unexpectedly quickly from January to May, to 1.6% from 1.1%. The funds rate has been below the annual inflation rate for 20 straight months. That's the longest such stretch of negative "real" interest rates since 1974-76, a period in which the Fed is now widely acknowledged to have been too lax, leading to the double-digit inflation of that era.

 HDU.S. Fed Boosts Key  Interest Rate  By Quarter Point --- Increase to 1.25% Sets Pace For `Measured' Campaign Ending Years of Lax Policy     BYBy Greg Ip     WC584 words   PD1 July 2004   SNThe Asian Wall Street Journal   SCAWSJ   PGA1   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

   LPThe U.S. Federal Reserve began the long climb back from a historic period of cheap money by raising its short-term interest rate target to 1.25% from 1%.  

The Fed also indicated it hoped to continue raising the rate in quarter-percentage-point increments. The Fed said it believes interest rates can be raised "at a pace that is likely to be measured." But it added an important caveat: policy makers "will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability." That is a warning that if inflation accelerates further in coming months, the central bank is apt to move to half-percentage-point increases.  
   TDBoth the decision and the wording were widely expected by markets in part thanks to an unprecedented effort by Fed officials, led by Chairman Alan Greenspan, to telegraph their plans in the months leading up to yesterday's decision. That was in part aimed at minimizing any shock to the markets. In that they seem to have succeeded: bond prices, up sharply in the run-up to the announcement, rose just slightly in the minutes after the move. Stock prices, in slightly negative territory minutes before the announcement, rallied a bit afterward.  

In its message, the Fed also said risks to both economic growth and inflation in coming months were balanced, also reinforcing the underlying message that rates are likely to continue rising slowly. "Output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor-market conditions have improved," the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee said in its statement. That has fanned some inflation, although "a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors," it said.  

In a related move, the central bank opted to raise the largely symbolic discount rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. The increase was approved unanimously by the Fed's board of governors.  

The Fed last raised the funds rate in May 2000 when it pushed it to 6.5% to cool an economic boom fueled by a bubble in stocks and technology investment spending. Then, as those bubbles burst, it began to cut rates in early January 2001, cutting it 11 times to 1.75% by the end of that year. Though the economy, which entered recession that March, pulled out in November, it was slow to recover as a wave of corporate accounting and governance scandals and the build up to the Iraq war restrained business confidence. That prompted a 12th rate cut in the fall of 2002 and, amid worries that low inflation could become deflation, a 13th, to 1%, one year ago this week.  

With job creation taking off in March, Fed officials concluded the need for easy monetary policy had passed. Indeed, some observers worry the Fed has waited too long. Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure jumping unexpectedly jumped from 1.7% in January to 2.5% in May Even without the more volatile food and energy components, "core" inflation has jumped from 1.1% to 1.6%, and is running at a 2.5% annual rate in the past six months.

 HDFed chairman's disclosure forms mirror those of previous year     BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA     CRAssociated Press Writer   WC459 words   PD1 July 2004   ET20:58   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the nation's most powerful economic policy-maker, essentially treaded water in terms of his investment holdings in 2003, which were little changed from the previous year.  

A financial disclosure form for Greenspan, released by the Federal Reserve Thursday, showed that the value of his assets last year totaled between $3 million and $6.4 million, nearly the same as in 2002. The figures need only be given in broad ranges.  
   TDAs chief of the Fed, Greenspan has preferred to keep all of his holdings in money market accounts and Treasury securities, which are considered the world's safest investment, to avoid any appearance of conflict that might be raised by stock holdings in individual companies.  

Greenspan, 78, recently began his fifth and final term as Fed chairman.  

The disclosure form also showed that Greenspan's income from his no-frills investments, which also include savings and checking accounts, totaled between $43,226 and $102,300. That's down from the range of $55,000 to $139,000 that Greenspan reported in investment income in 2002.  

Greenspan also was paid a $171,900 salary for being Fed chairman last year. His salary isn't included on the disclosure form.  

The safer investments that Greenspan holds typically pay less interest than riskier investments. Over the last several years people holding money market, bank and savings accounts, have seen dismal returns because interest rates have been near rock-bottom.  

Savers, however, will be getting a bit of relief now that short-term interest rates are going up. Greenspan and his colleagues on Wednesday boosted a key interest rate to 1.25 percent, from a 46-year-low of 1 percent, its first rate increase in four years.  

The Fed kept rates at super-low levels to help get the economy back in shape. Now that the economy is on a solid growth path, rates can go up to ward off inflation, which has been looming more prominently of late. Changes in the key rate the Fed controls affect interest rates to consumers.  

In the gifts section of his disclosure form, Greenspan listed travel in a private plane to go to New York City in late May of last year. That roundtrip plane travel, valued at $800, was listed as a gift from World Bank President James Wolfensohn. Greenspan traveled to New York to attend the wedding of Wolfensohn's son.  

Greenspan's wife, NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell, had separate investment holdings valued at between $1.3 million and nearly $3 million in 2003. Those assets generated income of between $15,715 and $48,500 last year.

 HDTaiwan shares slip after U.S. interest rise      WC378 words   PD1 July 2004   ET10:20   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Taiwan shares ended slightly lower Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised key interest rates by one quarter of a percentage point.   

The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange finished 2.53 points, or 0.04 percent, lower at 5,836.91 in dealings valued at 68.87 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$2.04 billion).   
   TDAdvancers narrowly outnumbered decliners 371 to 354, while 207 issues ended the day unchanged.   

Some dealers expressed surprise that the U.S. rate increase -- the first such rise in four years -- drove the Taiwan market down.   

"The bourse really should have risen now the interest rate uncertainty has been removed, and on net buying by foreign investors yesterday; this defies logic," said Daniel Hsin, a senior vice president at Capital Securities in Taipei.   

Taiwan's largest flat-panel maker AU Optronics fell 1 percent to NT$50.5, while smaller rival Chi Mei Optoelectronics dropped 1.9 percent to NT$53.   

Financial issues also weakened because Taiwan's central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates until the end of the year, and even then may not move as aggressively as the Federal Reserve, economists said.   

The finance subindex fell 0.3 percent, led by Mega Financial's 0.9 percent drop to NT$22.   

Taiwan's largest financial holding company, Cathay Financial, finished 1.7 percent higher to NT$59.5.   

Some sectors posted strong gains, including memory chip makers and the transportation sector. Nanya Technology rose 3.5 percent to NT$26.9, while Taiwan's largest maker of DRAM chips, Powerchip Semiconductor, added 2.2 percent to NT$27.7.   

Taiwan's largest carrier, China Airlines, advanced 5.7 percent to NT$18.5, while EVA Airways gained 4.3 percent to NT$14.65.   

Shippers also rose on expected higher shipping rates during the third quarter and lower fuel costs. Evergreen Marine closed 2.5 percent higher at NT$29.1, and Yang Ming Marine rose 2.6 percent to NT$31.8.   

The world's second largest contract chipmaker, United Microelectronics rose 0.8 percent to NT$25.2, but its larger rival, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, was flat at NT$48.4.

 HDDespite new increase, interest rates still seen as good deal for borrowers     BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA     CRAssociated Press Writer   WC834 words   PD1 July 2004   ET08:19   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve policy-makers took the first step in what they signaled should be a slow rise in interest rates. Even with the Fed's first rate increase in four years, costs to borrow money still remain a pretty good deal for Americans.  

The modest one-quarter percentage point increase ordered Wednesday nudged up a key short-term interest rate controlled by the Fed to 1.25 percent, from a 46-year low of 1 percent.  
   TDIn response, commercial banks, including Wells Fargo and Wachovia, announced that they were boosting their prime lending rate by a corresponding amount -- to 4.25 percent, from 4 percent. The prime rate, a benchmark for many short-term consumer and business loans, also hasn't gone up in four years.  

"A prime interest rate of 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent is still pretty cheap by historical standards," said Chris Weber, an economics professor at Seattle University. People taking out loans for cars, homes and other big-ticket goods will pay more in interest, but rates should still continue to be attractive, analysts said.  

For savers, who have been stuck with measly returns over the past several years, the Fed's decision means they will earn a bit more interest on bank accounts, certificates of deposit and other savings products.  

"The first interest rate hike in four years is long overdue in the eyes of depositors," said Greg McBride, a financial analyst with Bankrate.com, an online financial service. "However, it will take considerable action by the Fed before yields return to historical norms."  

The nationwide average for a one-year CD is currently 1.50 percent, while the historical norm would be in the 3.5 percent to 4 percent range, he said.  

Last June, the Fed pushed down its key short-term rate to 1 percent, marking the 13th rate cut in a series that began in January 2001. During that time, the Fed battled to help an economy staggered by a series of blows from a plunging stock market and the 2001 recession to terrorist attacks and two wars.  

With the economic recovery now firmly rooted and the jobs climate improving, the Fed felt it was safe to start raising rates to head off inflation, which has been moving higher, analysts said.  

The Fed suggested that for now it wasn't overly worried about inflation. "Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors," the Fed said.  

Against that backdrop, Fed policy-makers were still of the view that they could raise rates gradually. But they also said they stood ready to act more aggressively should inflation prospects worsen, a point that has previously been made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on several occasions.  

Economists interpreted the Fed's remarks, taken all together, as boding for further, modest one-quarter point rate increases in the future, including one at the next meeting on Aug. 10.  

"The Fed will proceed at an extremely cautious pace in this tightening cycle," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns.  

Some economists predict the funds rate could rise to 2 percent by the end of this year, which would mean the prime rate would move up by a corresponding amount to 5 percent.  

Rates on 30-year mortgages, which last week stood at 6.25 percent, are expected to rise to around 6.9 percent by year's end, which still would be low by historical standards.  

The Fed's quarter-point increase also means higher rates on credit cards tied to the prime rate, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, economists said. McBride said the average nationwide rate on a home equity loan is currently 7.22 percent, on a home equity line of credit is 4.77 percent, and on a variable-rate credit card is 13.53 percent.  

The economy has been a hot topic in the presidential campaign, with President Bush insisting things are rebounding and Sen. John Kerry talking about a squeeze on the middle class. Analysts said voters likely would see little impact on the economy between now and November from the Fed's action.  

White House spokesman Scott McClellan said, "It's not unexpected that as the economy continues growing stronger that interest rates may rise some. That's not something at this point that is a concern."  

Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to Kerry, D-Mass., said the real threat to interest rates was not Fed action but Bush's tax cuts, which have caused the federal budget deficit to balloon.  

Economists, meanwhile, believe the Fed's rate-raising campaign will be slow and may stretch into early 2006. "Consumers should not be fearful that rates will go up suddenly," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management.

 HDUS embarks on long anti-inflation struggle     BYDJW     WC605 words   PD1 July 2004   ET12:41   SNAgence France Presse   SCAFPR   LAEnglish   CYCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2004 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON, July 1 (AFP) -  

US Federal Reserve policymakers have embarked on a long fight to smother inflation by gradually raising interest rates in the solid, jobs-rich American economy.  
   TDThe big fear is that prices run out of control, forcing the central bank to jack up rates at a faster pace that chills the economy.  

While seeking to assuage those concerns by setting out a path of measured interest rate rises, the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday it would do whatever it takes to vanquish inflation.  

FOMC members voted unanimously to raise the target for the federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, to 1.25 percent from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent.  

Economists believe rates will return to a neutral level -- about 4.0 percent at the current inflation rate -- by the end of 2005.  

With inflation relatively low except for some apparently transitory hotspots, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues said they expected to move at a "measured" pace.  

But the policymakers vowed to do whatever is needed if inflation rears unexpectedly.  

"Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors," they said.  

Risks to growth and inflation appeared balanced, the FOMC said.  

"With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured," the policymakers said.  

"Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."  

After a year of no change in rates and three years of cuts, investors sweated about the pace of future increases.  

"What does all this mean? Simply, it is the desire of the FOMC to move rates up slowly but it will be the economy that determines the speed," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.  

"Moderate growth and minimally accelerating inflation will allow that dream to come true. Stronger economic growth and more rapidly rising price pressures will lead to faster and sharper rate hikes. Mr. Greenspan already warned that could happen and dont be surprised if it does."  

Greenspan and his colleages sprung into action only after a jobs drought broke, and prices began to rise.  

Since January 2001, they had cut rates steeply to offset the popping of the technology bubble in the late 1990s, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  

The tightening cycle begins at a delicate time, with President George W. Bush fighting for reelection November 2.  

The interest rates rise is simply "a reflection that the economy is growing stronger," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said shortly before the announcement.  

Democratic presidential contender John Kerry's campaign avoided direct comment on the rate rise but said Bush's policies had put upward pressure on longer-term borrowing costs.  

"The real issue is that George Bush's abandonment of fiscal discipline will mean higher long-term interest rates," Kerry's economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said in a statement.  

Some areas of the US economy may prove vulnerable to rising rates, analysts said.  

Higher interest rates tend to brake consumer spending by pushing up the cost of borrowing on credit cards, bank loans, and to slow the housing market by raising the cost of mortgage payments.  

Federal Reserve members also raised the discount rate, at which the central bank loans to commercial banks overnight, by the same quarter-point margin to 2.25 percent.

   LP* U.S. Treasury 10-year prices closed at some of the best levels since late May after the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee raised the Fed funds target by 25 bps. Although the curve flattened for the better part of the session, the curve ended steeper with the 2-year/10-year variety at 190.1 bps compared to 186.6 on Tuesday's close.  

* With the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement behind them, FX market players Wednesday began to focus on upcoming global data, expected now to set the short-term tone for the major currency pairs, traders said. The Fed's decision to raise U.S. interest rates by 25 basis points came as no surprise and the accompanying statement also did not deviate greatly from most analysts expectations, they noted.  
   TD* Federal Reserve policymakers took a cautious approach in raising short-term interest rates Wednesday, and they reiterated their intention to keep raising rates at a "measured" or gradual pace. But the members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee simultaneously left themselves room to raise rates more aggressively, saying they "would respond as needed" to keep inflation under control. The clear message was that, for the foreseeable future, the FOMC hopes to be able to raise the federal funds rate in 25 basis point increments, but that it will not shy from larger moves if inflation continues to accelerate.  

* Very few analysts changed their forecast for the June manufacturing Institute of Supply Management index following the weaker-than-expected Chicago PMI report Wednesday. The few downward revisions were not enough to change the median estimate and analysts remain optimistic about manufacturing jobs. A Market News International survey shows a median expectation for a slight decline to 61.0 in June ISM from 62.8 in May, which would be the lowest level since 57.1 in October 2003. The report is due Thursday, July 1 at 10:00 am EDT.  

* Officials at mortgage financier Freddie Mac Wednesday reiterated expectations of slower mortgage portfolio growth going forward, in comments that accompanied an announcement of 52% declines in both earnings and net income in 2003. The long-awaited 2003 earnings release came and went Wednesday morning with little market fanfare, overshadowed in part by the expected afternoon U.S. interest rate decision, agency market players said.  

* Ecuador's foreign minister Wednesday protested the inclusion of Ecuador on a blacklist of shrimp exporters accused of unfair dumping practices, arguing in Washington that the country is being unfairly grouped with other foreign subsidizers.  

* The International Monetary Fund Wednesday approved the third quarterly review of Colombia's two-year loan program, releasing an additional $284 million, and praised the nation's economic policies. With the latest disbursement, Colombia has about $1.70 billion available under the IMF loan.  

* Mexico's President Vicente Fox Wednesday issued the latest upbeat assessment of the Mexican economy, saying that markets now expect GDP to expand by over 4% this year, beyond the official goal. "All forecasts indicate that at the end of the year economic growth could be greater than 4%," Fox told a business conference in Mexico City. Finance Minister Francisco Gil Diaz announced last week the government had revised its growth estimate to 4% up from 3%-3.5% on increased U.S. demand for Mexican manufacturing exports.  

* The job growth trajectory moderated in June as employers caught their breath from the explosive hiring pace of the prior three months - but all indicators continue to point to steady and sustainable improvement in the job market going forward, say staffing firm executives.

    LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates
for the first time in four years on June 30, boosting the Fed funds rate a
quarter percentage point to 1.25 percent.
    Following the increase, the average rate set by the central banks of the
   

Group of Seven nations rose to 1.95 percent from 1.90 percent. The average rate   
   TDof 11 leading central banks - G7 plus six other major banks - rose to 2.47   

percent from 2.45 percent.   

The following table of average rates is aimed at reflecting the movement of   

official policy rates during the economic cycle rather than actual borrowing   

costs.

    NOTES:
    If rates change more than once a month, the last rate for that month is
listed.
    1. The Bank of Japan shifted policy target from the uncollateralised
   

overnight call rate to outstanding balance of current account deposits that   

banks and other institutions hold at the BOJ, the so-called quantitative easing,   

on March 19, 2001. Since then the call rate has been effectively zero.   

2. The Swiss National Bank targets a range for the three-month Swiss franc   

LIBOR rate. On June 17 it raised key interest rates by a quarter point, widening   

its interest rate target band to 0.00 to 1.00 percent from 0.00-0.75 percent   

where it had stood since March 6, 2003. The SNB said it now aimed for the   

mid-point, or 0.50 percent within the new, wider target band.   

3. The Bank of Mexico manages reserve money through weekly open market   

operations. The benchmark is the 28-day treasury bills, Cetes. This is a monthly   

average rate, rounded to one decimal.   

4. The Bank of Indonesia's benchmark rate is the one month Sertifikat Bank   

Indonesia (SBI). The bank uses a weighted rate at the last auction of the month   

to reflect the rate for the whole month. Figure rounded to one decimal.

 HDANALYSTS' VIEW-U.S.  Federal reserve  rate rise.      WC418 words   PD1 July 2004   ET08:39   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004 Reuters Limited   
   LPLONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Following is a selection of analysts' comments following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to raise interest rates.   

LATEST QUOTES   
   TDPAUL MACKEL, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, ABN AMRO   

"It was as expected. Overall people thought the dollar would sell off markedly and that wasn't the case. Euro/dollar blipped up but a big part of the market is sitting on the sidelines.   

"The next move for the dollar is to see whether they do 50 basis points in August. Given recent data it doesn't seem to be the case but the dollar is going to trade very whippily now with U.S. interest rate expectations because everyone is going to try to gauge the pace - how fast can the Fed go?"   

IAN STANNARD, CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT BNP PARIBAS   

"Overall this was very much what the market was expecting and had priced in. The 25 basis points was no surprise and in the statement they reinforced this idea of raising rates at a measured pace.   

Given the lack of hawkish surprises it does look like the dollar came under a little bit of pressure. This allowed euro/dollar to push to the top of the trading range we have seen over the Pamarkets ease back some of the aggressive rate hikes priced in.   

But at this stage the upside will be short-lived."   

KAMAL SHARMA, DRESDNER KLEINWORT WASSERSTEIN, LONDON   

"The Fed delivered what it had signalled to the the market, namely a 25 basis point hike and the promise of further tightening at a measured pace. There were no major surprises here and all eyes will remain on the U.S. data outlook."   

EARLIER QUOTE   

MICHAEL ROTTMANN, HEAD OF FOREX AND FIXED INCOME RESEARCH, HYPOVEREINSBANK   

"In the end, there were no surprises as the Fed made it clear that they will move slowly. So far, another 25 basis points rate rise makes sense in August. But going forward there is a risk that the core CPI would rise above 2.00 percent and that would lead the market to start pricing in a 50 basis points rate hike somewhere down the road. Thisthat the response of the market was too positive yesterday. The Fed will also keep a close eye on the equity market and credit spreads to see whether they respond negatively to rate rises. So far, the financial indicators remain in good shape which suggests the Fed will continue to raise rates."

 CLMCredit Markets   HDExtra! Man Bites Dog: Pimco's Gross Buys Ahead of Rate Rise   BYBy Aaron Lucchetti    WC1,086 words   PD1 July 2004   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPTHE WORLD'S biggest bond-fund manager did something this month that most investors are taught not to do: He bought bonds as interest rates were about to start rising.

With the market anticipating that the Federal Reserve would move up its target short-term interest rate for the first time in four years -- which it did yesterday -- Pacific Investment Management Co.'s William Gross changed his long-held and loudly voiced bearishness on bonds and charged into the market in a big way. He bought about $35 billion in Treasury notes and other high-quality U.S. debt securities over the past two weeks, while selling some of his positions in European debt.
   TDRising interest rates usually are a bad thing for bonds, so why was he buying? Turns out the bet by Mr. Gross and his firm, better known as Pimco, looked smart yesterday as bond investors welcomed the Fed's well-telegraphed one-quarter percentage-point rate increase.

The benchmark, 10-year Treasury note rose 24/32, or $7.50 per $1,000 invested, sending the yield -- which moves in the opposite direction -- down to 4.593%. Since early June, the 10-year yield is down from levels above 4.80%, and shorter-term bond yields also have slipped from their recent highs.

Why are bonds holding their own as short-term interest rates begin what is expected to be a steady climb higher?

Many chalk it up to the fact that longer-term bond yields already have moved so far, from 3.1% last June to 4.6% this week, in reaction to stronger economic data and Fed statements hinting at likely interest-rate increases to come. The thinking is that, barring an inflation surprise, yields don't have much more lift in them.

Also, a number of investors have been putting money back into Treasurys in recent weeks on the belief that Fed rate increases will be steady and that economic growth may slow in coming quarters, giving the Fed less need to keep ratcheting up rates.

"Value is returning to the Treasury market," Mr. Gross, Pimco's chief investment officer, said yesterday after the Fed's rate move. Since mid-June Pimco, which manages about $400 billion in bonds, moved about $35 billion to U.S. debt securities -- mostly Treasurys as well as some mortgage-related bonds -- with money from sales of European bonds, Mr. Gross said.

"We're seeing some signs that the economy is slowing down," says Mr. Gross, specifically noting recent "disappointing" June sales projections from General Motors Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., as well as weaker-than-expected manufacturing data this week.

Mr. Gross certainly still has concerns about the Treasury market, including the U.S. budget deficit, the sensitivity of foreign demand for Treasurys and the possibility that inflation will move higher in the next few months. But he's betting that much of the inflation fear and Fed rate-rise campaign already is discounted into bond yields, especially among two-year and five-year notes.

In fact, the repositioning represents the first time Pimco has lifted its defensive stance on bonds in about a year, Mr. Gross says. One sign of this is Pimco's decision to increase the duration of most of its major bond portfolios. Duration is a measure of interest-rate sensitivity, and the largest Pimco portfolios' durations are now back to roughly equal that of their benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.

"While it wasn't an end-of-bear-market call," the repositioning "was a recognition that it was time to get back into the U.S., if only because we'd be returning to value," says Mr. Gross.

In recent weeks, Pimco has bought five-year Treasury note futures, which the firm believes is one of the more-undervalued parts of the Treasury market, says Mark Kiesel, a Pimco executive vice president. He says the economy tends to cool off about six to 12 months after longer-term bond yields rise. Such a slowdown should help bonds this summer, he adds. (Bonds tend to perform well when the economy is slowing and suffer when the economy is soaring.)

Mr. Kiesel says Pimco likes five-year notes over 10-year Treasurys because the former will be less susceptible to inflation fears and shifts in foreign demand. Since June 2003, the yield on the five-year note has risen to 3.8% from a low of about 2%.

Last week Pimco illustrated its newfound interest in Treasurys by gobbling up $7.5 billion to $8 billion of the two-year Treasury note auction. Pimco bought about 30% of the $25 billion auction, scooping up more bonds in dollar terms than it had ever bought before in one auction, according to Mr. Gross.

To buy those Treasurys, Pimco sold European bonds, including German bonds that rallied against U.S. bonds earlier this year. Mr. Kiesel notes that five-year yields on German bonds were now about one-quarter percentage point lower than yields on U.S. five-year notes.

Mr. Kiesel recommends that investors stay cautious in bonds but adds that "we're close to the end of the selloff" in fixed income. He says that yields on the 10-year Treasury note may not get much higher than 5% and that the five-year Treasury yield shouldn't rise much beyond 4%.

Pimco's move into U.S. Treasurys also reflects a growing belief among some investors that the yield curve will flatten, meaning that the difference between short and long-term yields will shrink. Bond investors generally suffer when interest rates rise, but not all bonds perform equally. For example, if the Fed is viewed as keeping inflation under control by raising rates, the shorter-term notes may suffer, but five-year and 10-year notes likely will hold steady and generate higher yields.

Another possible support for Treasurys: Consumer debt has increased significantly, meaning it might take only a small rate increase to soften the economy and put a lid on inflation, which would deter the Fed from further rate increases and aid holders of long-term bonds.

"This economic environment features lots of leverage and the potential for an economy tipping over if rates get too high," Mr. Gross says.

   LPNOW INVESTORS can stop worrying about the Federal Reserve -- and start worrying about corporate earnings.

Fed policy makers yesterday did exactly what the market expected them to do: They raised their target short-term interest rate by a quarter point, the first increase in four years, and repeated their intention to be "measured" with future increases.
   TDStocks reacted with mild gains, and the bond market, which is driven more heavily than stocks by Fed interest-rate policy, celebrated with a sharp uptick.

"The Federal Reserve has a new policy of transparency and has kept its word," wrote Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn in a report to clients.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 22.05 points, or 0.21%, to 10435.48 -- leaving it virtually unchanged both for the quarter and for the full year. Investors now are wondering whether second-quarter profit reports, which will be streaming out this month, will feature the overall gains of more than 20% that analysts are forecasting.

The price of the 10-year Treasury bond jumped 24/32 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 invested, as its yield fell to 4.593%. That still is well above 3.83%, where the yield stood March 31, at the end of the previous quarter. The yield's rise over the past three months reflects the widespread expectation that the Fed will continue boosting its target rate, perhaps to 2% by the end of the year. For the past 12 months, the target has sat at 1%, a 45-year low. The Fed meets again in August, September, November and December. Mr. Sohn forecasts that the Fed rate could hit 2.25% by the end of the year, and as much as 4.5% by the end of 2005.

The bond yield has declined from the level of 4.87% hit on June 14, when some traders thought the Fed might raise its target rate by half a point yesterday as part of an aggressive effort to fight inflation. Though the Fed indicated yesterday that it could raise rates faster if inflation surged, investors were reassured at the Fed's reiteration of its "measured" plans.

The rate increase will have an immediate, negative impact on many ordinary borrowers. Several banks, including Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo &Co., Northern Trust Corp. and KeyCorp, raised their lending rates immediately, boosting their prime rates to 4.25% from 4.0%. Others are expected to do the same.

The economy's two main lending benchmarks are the prime rate, which now has begun to rise, and the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which had been rising in anticipation of the Fed move.

Because the move was so heavily telegraphed, stock-market reaction was muted. Only 1.46 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly higher than the depressed levels seen earlier last month but only average for the year.

Investors find themselves pulled in two directions -- encouraged by earnings prospects but worried about terrorism, Iraq, inflation and the coming election. Those competing forces help explain why stocks finished little changed both for the quarter and for the year.

The broad Standard &Poor's 500-stock index yesterday rose 0.41%, or 4.64 points, to 1140.84, up 1.3% for the quarter and 2.6% for the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index, whose many technology stocks have fluctuated sharply during the year, rose 0.63%, or 12.86 points, to 2047.79 -- up 2.7% on the quarter and 2.2% on the year.

"Now that the market has finished obsessing over interest rates, maybe it can focus on earnings. We think this is setting us up for what could be a nice few weeks as the earnings season begins," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Trust in Chicago. If the Fed is able to keep its rate increases measured, as expected, it "means that they are going to continue to keep short-term interest rates below the pace of inflation, and that should continue to benefit corporate profits."

Outside the U.S., stocks were virtually unchanged in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 0.04 point to 150.39.

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, 2,410 stocks rose and 881 fell.

Bonds gained. In addition to the 10-year issue's move, the 30-year bond was up 31/32 point, to yield 5.300%.

The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 108.83 yen, up from 108.37, while the euro rose against the dollar to $1.2196 from $1.2083.

 SEInternational   HDECB Isn't Likely To Follow Fed Move And Raise Rates   BYBy G. Thomas Sims    WC664 words   PD1 July 2004   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA12   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPFRANKFURT -- While the U.S.'s move to raise interest rates yesterday was clear-cut and expected, what the European Central Bank does next isn't nearly as simple: The bank would like to raise rates to stem inflation, but doing so could spell a quick end to the euro zone's sluggish growth.

When top officials from the ECB gather in Frankfurt today for their monthly policy meeting, they won't easily be able to follow the lead of the Federal Reserve, which yesterday raised its key interest rate a quarter percentage point to curb inflation, or match recent rate increases in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. An ECB rate rise could create problems for the euro zone's economic recovery by increasing the costs of borrowing money and by curtailing investment.
   TDThe euro-zone recovery so far has been built largely on exports to the U.S. and other faster-growing regions. If anything, economists say any resulting brake on the global economy from an end to stimulative policies of the Fed and central banks elsewhere in the world could encourage the ECB to wait longer before raising interest rates, despite a pickup in inflation from higher oil prices.

The Federation of German Banks says in its most recent report that the ECB shouldn't feel pressure to follow the Fed. "On the contrary: The knock-on effects of a U.S. rate rise on capital-market rates and the euro-zone business cycle could make it easier for the guardians of Europe's currency to keep their own borrowing costs lower," the banking group said.

In recent weeks, some ECB officials have tried to play down expectations among some investors that rates will rise in the euro zone sooner rather than later, partly because unemployment is still near 9%.

Slow growth and high inflation have become typical of the euro zone, but the problems have grown more acute in recent months as oil prices have risen and recoveries elsewhere in the world have surpassed Europe's. Yesterday, the dichotomy was underscored by official economic data showing uncomfortably high inflation and shaky confidence.

Inflation remains well above the ECB's yearly target of "close to but below 2%." Consumer-price inflation rose an annual 2.4% in June, down only slightly from May's 2.5%. The decline reflected a moderate drop in oil prices after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month decided to increase output.

The bank fears that still-high oil prices could cause workers to demand higher wages, creating an inflationary spiral. Last month, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank's primary aim in the next few months was to prevent such inflationary pressures. The bank has already missed its ambitious inflation target in four of the past five years.

But in one of many signs that the ECB isn't ready to follow its peers, ECB officials are emphasizing that the economy is growing only gradually. That outlook was confirmed yesterday after a monthly European Commission survey revealed a decline in euro-zone economic sentiment in June to 99.8 from 100.1, below the long-term average. Increased pessimism in the services sector -- which makes up two-thirds of the euro-zone economy -- was behind the decline. According to most forecasts, the euro-zone economy is projected to grow only about 1.8% this year, less than half the projected global average of 4.5%.

The ECB's key rate has been at 2% for a little more than a year. Most recently the ECB has said it has no "bias," or preference, for either higher or lower rates. At today's meeting, ECB officials will discuss to what extent an increase in rates to stamp out inflation could crush an incipient recovery that's so slow in coming.

   LPThe Federal Reserve has hopped effortlessly on to the interest rate tightrope. Yesterday's rise in the Fed funds rate - the first in four years - was so well flagged that markets barely budged. Rates had to rise and will rise further. At 1.25 per cent, they remain at emergency levels, while the economy has moved beyond the danger zone. Growth is robust, job creation has returned and inflation is again stirring.

The challenge now is for the Fed to keep its balance as it moves towards a more neutral interest rate, commonly estimated at 4-5 per cent. The Fed increased its flexibility, saying it will respond to changes in economic prospects to maintain price stability. But retaining its line that rises are "likely to be measured" still limits its room for manoeuvre.
   TDThat is clearly what the markets would like. But the Fed's ability to deliver remains at the mercy of the data. Data can change quickly. The recent jump in both job creation and inflation figures led to a sharp rise in bonds yields and the worst quarter for US treasuries in 24 years.

If inflation, for example, continues to rise the Fed will face a dilemma. Remaining "measured", which many interpret as limiting each rate increase to 25 basis points, would fuel fears that the Fed is behind the curve and drive up long-term rates. But more aggressive moves could wrong-foot financial markets. The Fed needs all the flexibility it can get. Investors should expect some wobbles as rates move towards a more sustainable level.

 HDYen lifted by strong Tankan survey.   BYBY STEVE JOHNSON IN LONDON    WC501 words   PD1 July 2004   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPThe US Federal Reserve put the currency market out of its misery by finally delivering its first interest rate rise for four years on Wednesday.

But with the 25-basis point hike already universally expected, and no surprises in the accompanying statement, the long-awaited move was immediately overshadowed by economic news from Japan.
   TDThe quarterly Tankan survey of business confidence came in far better than expected, with the closely-watched large manufacturers' diffusion index jumping to +22 from +12 in March, trouncing consensus forecasts for a reading of +17. Not only was this the best figure since September 1991, but the sister index for small companies rose to its highest mark since December 1991.

"Another very strong Tankan confirms the strength of the economic cycle, said Richard Jerram at ING Financial Markets. "The breadth of the recovery continues to be impressive."

The yen, which had edged lower earlier in the week off the back of soft economic data, bounced back, gaining Y1.1 against the dollar at Y107.87, Y1.3 versus the euro at Y131.39 and Y1.2 against sterling at Y196.09.

However the yen rally was capped by data from Japan's ministry of finance showing a net outflow of Y953bn from Japanese assets in the week to June 25, due to overseas investors selling Japanese bonds and Japanese investors buying overseas bonds.

"We expect these flows to persist, limiting the potential upside for the yen," said Derek Halpenny, currency economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi

The dollar slipped in the immediate aftermath of the Fed announcement, with the tenor of the accompanying statement adjudged to be dovish. The central bank maintained its claim that policy accommodation can be removed "at a pace that is likely to be measured", while it also sounded relaxed about inflation, arguing that a "portion" of the recent pick-up has been due to "transitory factors".

"With its relatively dovish language, this statement is clearly an attempt to minimise the fallout in markets from this first step on the Fed's tightening cycle," said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING.

However the greenback regained some ground against European currencies in Wednesday morning London trade, thanks to soft data on the eastern side of the Atlantic.

The eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) defied predictions by falling to 54.4 in June, from 54.7 in May, although it remained above the 50 breakeven level. Italy and Germany bore the brunt of the unexpected weakness, with the latter seeing a large drop in new orders due to falling export growth. The euro slipped back to $1.2180 against the dollar.

Similarly, the UK CIPS manufacturing survey also surprised the markets by registering a fall, to 54.8, from 55.7 in May, with the employment component falling back to breakeven. This allowed sterling to stabilise at $1.8176 against the dollar and GBP0.6699 versus the euro.

   LP* U.S. Treasury 10-year prices closed at some of the best levels since late May after the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee raised the Fed funds target by 25 bps. Although the curve flattened for the better part of the session, the curve ended steeper with the 2-year/10-year variety at 190.1 bps compared to 186.6 on Tuesday's close.  

* With the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement behind them, FX market players Wednesday began to focus on upcoming global data, expected now to set the short-term tone for the major currency pairs, traders said. The Fed's decision to raise U.S. interest rates by 25 basis points came as no surprise and the accompanying statement also did not deviate greatly from most analysts expectations, they noted.  
   TD* Federal Reserve policymakers took a cautious approach in raising short-term interest rates Wednesday, and they reiterated their intention to keep raising rates at a "measured" or gradual pace. But the members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee simultaneously left themselves room to raise rates more aggressively, saying they "would respond as needed" to keep inflation under control. The clear message was that, for the foreseeable future, the FOMC hopes to be able to raise the federal funds rate in 25 basis point increments, but that it will not shy from larger moves if inflation continues to accelerate.  

* Very few analysts changed their forecast for the June manufacturing Institute of Supply Management index following the weaker-than-expected Chicago PMI report Wednesday. The few downward revisions were not enough to change the median estimate and analysts remain optimistic about manufacturing jobs. A Market News International survey shows a median expectation for a slight decline to 61.0 in June ISM from 62.8 in May, which would be the lowest level since 57.1 in October 2003. The report is due Thursday, July 1 at 10:00 am EDT.  

* Officials at mortgage financier Freddie Mac Wednesday reiterated expectations of slower mortgage portfolio growth going forward, in comments that accompanied an announcement of 52% declines in both earnings and net income in 2003. The long-awaited 2003 earnings release came and went Wednesday morning with little market fanfare, overshadowed in part by the expected afternoon U.S. interest rate decision, agency market players said.  

* Ecuador's foreign minister Wednesday protested the inclusion of Ecuador on a blacklist of shrimp exporters accused of unfair dumping practices, arguing in Washington that the country is being unfairly grouped with other foreign subsidizers.  

* The International Monetary Fund Wednesday approved the third quarterly review of Colombia's two-year loan program, releasing an additional $284 million, and praised the nation's economic policies. With the latest disbursement, Colombia has about $1.70 billion available under the IMF loan.  

* Mexico's President Vicente Fox Wednesday issued the latest upbeat assessment of the Mexican economy, saying that markets now expect GDP to expand by over 4% this year, beyond the official goal. "All forecasts indicate that at the end of the year economic growth could be greater than 4%," Fox told a business conference in Mexico City. Finance Minister Francisco Gil Diaz announced last week the government had revised its growth estimate to 4% up from 3%-3.5% on increased U.S. demand for Mexican manufacturing exports.  

* The job growth trajectory moderated in June as employers caught their breath from the explosive hiring pace of the prior three months - but all indicators continue to point to steady and sustainable improvement in the job market going forward, say staffing firm executives.

 HDFed increases key  interest rate  by a quarter of a percentage point     BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA     CRAssociated Press Writer   WC812 words   PD30 June 2004   ET21:00   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve boosted a key short-term interest rate by a one-quarter percentage point Wednesday, its first rate increase in four years, in an attempt to keep the U.S. economy and inflation on an even keel.  

Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his Federal Open Market Committee colleagues -- the group that sets interest rate policy in the United States -- increased the federal funds rate to 1.25 percent. The funds rate, the Fed's primary tool for influencing economic activity, had been at 1 percent, a 46-year low, for a year.  
   TDAs a result of the Fed's unanimous decision to push up the funds rate, commercial banks' were expected to increase by a corresponding amount their prime lending rate for many short-term consumer and business loans. The prime rate, which has been at 4 percent, the lowest level in more than four decades for a year, is expected to rise to 4.25 percent.  

The economy has been a hot topic in the presidential campaign with President George W. Bush insisting things are rebounding and Sen. John Kerry talking about a squeeze on the middle class. Analysts said voters will likely see little impact on the economy between now and November from the Fed's action.  

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials gained around 8 points after the Fed's announcement.  

Fed policy-makers, wrapping up a two-day meeting Wednesday, also held to the view that they could gradually raise rates to head off inflation. The Fed said it believes any rate increases can be "at a pace that is likely to be measured."  

Economists said hints at further, modest one-quarter point rate increases in the future, including one at the next meeting on Aug. 10.  

The Fed made clear, however, if will take more aggressive action if needed. This restated a position that Greenspan had articulated earlier.  

"The committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability," the Fed policy-makers said.  

Their latest assessment of the state of the economy was upbeat. The Fed said the economy is expanding at a solid pace and that labor markets are improving. On the inflation front, the Fed said that "although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors."  

Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management, said: "We are now at a very important turning point for monetary policy. The Fed is now acting to ensure that the economy can continue to expand at a good pace but that success in restraining inflation can be retained."  

Hours before the Fed's announcement, White House, spokesman Scott McClellan said: "It's not unexpected that as the economy continues growing stronger that interest rates may rise some. That's not something at this point that is a concern."  

A one-quarter point increase would not deter the economic recovery, but it will put the Fed on a course of higher borrowing costs, geared in part to head off inflation, economists said.  

For the first five months of this year, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 5.1 percent, exceeding the 1.9 percent increase for all of last year. Excluding volatile energy and foods costs, "core" prices increased at a rate of 2.9 percent, compared with a 1.1 percent advance registered for 2003.  

Although the current rate of inflation is still low by historical standards, businesses are finding it easier to raise prices now than during the economic slump.  

Some economists predict the funds rate could rise to 2 percent by the end of this year, which would mean the prime rate would move up by a corresponding amount to 5 percent.  

The economy, which was knocked down by the 2001 recession and jolted by the Sept. 11, terror attacks and corporate accounting scandals, finally staged a material rebound in the second half of last year.  

The economy grew at a decent 3.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year. But projections for the current quarter are wide-ranging, from a 2.5 percent rate to just over a 4.5 percent pace. Economist say estimates would be stronger if not for the expectations that higher energy costs will probably dampen consumer spending, a key force in the economy.  

Companies, meanwhile, have stepped up hiring in the last several months, signaling a long-awaited turnaround in the labor market. The economy added 248,000 jobs in May, compared with a loss of 28,000 for the same month last year.  

The Labor Department will release the employment figures for June on Friday.

 HDBrazil's markets gain on relief after US rate hike.      WC419 words   PD30 June 2004   ET23:35   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004 Reuters Limited   
   LP SAO PAULO, Brazil, June 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian financial markets marched higher on Wednesday after concerns about a stronger-than-expected U.S. monetary tightening died down following a modest Federal Reserve interest rate hike, traders said.    

 The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's benchmark Bovespa index  closed 1.67 percent higher at 21,148.9 points.    
   TD Brazil's currency, the real , gained 0.74 percent to 3.087 per U.S. dollar. The currency reversed an earlier loss when investors tried to weaken the real in order to reap a higher local currency payout when they redeem about $2.5 billion in dollar-linked debt on Thursday.    

 As expected, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 1.25 percent, ending its four-year policy of monetary easing. The rise was the first since a 0.5 percentage-point increase in May 2000.    

 Traders said the move took a weight off Brazilian markets, which had lost ground in recent months on concerns steep U.S. rate hikes would discourage investment in emerging markets.    

 "The most important factor was the Fed reiterating it will be gradual in its future rate hikes. This works like magic in terms of relieving investors' fears and could open the door to more market gains now," said Francisco Andrade, a managing partner at Perimeter Asset Management in Sao Paulo.    

 The Fed hike helped the Bovespa to extend recent gains and to end June with an 8 percent rise, the strongest monthly gain since December.    

 However, the index is still down almost 5 percent in the six months ending in June after having reached a six-month low of 17,604 on May 10 on worries higher U.S. rates could take the shine off investments in the country. Since then, the Bovespa has recovered more than 20 percent of its value.    

 Shares of Brasil Telecom (BRTP4.SA) rose 2.5 percent to 18.91 reais. On Wednesday, Brazil's antitrust body said Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) can retake a voting stake in the company, with restrictions. The Italian telephone operator had been fighting for months with Brasil Telecom and equity fund Opportunity for a say in running the company.    

 Meanwhile, shares of aircraft maker Embraer (EMBR4.SA) stood out with a 3.8 percent gain to 22.05 reais after Finnish airline Finnair said on Wednesday it planned to buy 12 new planes from the company in a deal worth $320 million.

 HDConsumer Confidence Leaps to a Two-Year High --- Rise Suggests Rate Boost Likely Won't Curb Spending; Jobs, Wages Provide a Lift   BYBy Greg Ip    WC1,023 words   PD30 June 2004   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPWASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence hit a two-year high in June, easing fears that household spending will peter out as the effects of tax cuts wane and interest rates begin to rise.

The Conference Board, a New York business research organization that surveys households monthly, said its consumer-confidence index, based on a survey of 5,000 households, jumped to 101.9 in June from 93.1 in May. Driving the increase was a big improvement in perceptions of the job market, with 18% of survey respondents saying jobs are plentiful, up from 16.6% in May, while 26.5% said jobs are hard to get, down from 30.3% in May.
   TDThe growing optimism, mirroring an earlier report by the University of Michigan's consumer survey, comes even though gasoline prices shot up during the spring and long-term interest rates began rising in April. Economists say the revival of the job market and recent increases in wages are boosting consumer spirits and giving Americans more money to spend, overwhelming the hit caused by higher energy costs and interest rates.

Indeed, consumers already have taken higher interest rates into account. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to boost its target today on the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 1.25% from 1%, in the first in what is likely to be a series of increases to bring rates to more normal levels. In the Conference Board survey, 68% expect interest rates to be higher 12 months from now.

That has had no discernible effect on buying plans. The proportion of consumers expecting to buy a home or car in the next six months remains in the same range it has for the last year, and the proportion expecting to buy a major appliance reached a six-year high.

A fall-off in consumer spending seemed likely to many economists with the end of additional federal tax cuts, a rise in interest rates that would reduce mortgage refinancings and a surge in energy costs. Those are "three things anyone would have said would have called the end to consumer spending," said Susan Sterne, president of Economic Analysis Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., research firm specializing in consumer trends. But consumers are "holding on darn well," she said.

There are some signs that the growth in consumer spending has slowed of late. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and General Motors Corp. all said this week that their June sales were below expectations. A weekly survey of chain stores by the International Council of Shopping Centers and investment bank UBS AG said sales fell 1.2% last week from the week before. Retailers blamed cool, wet weather.

Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said consumer spending, which has been growing at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 4%, probably will grow at a pace of between 2.5% and 3% for the rest of this year. He said tax cuts and consumers' ability to borrow against the value of their homes by refinancing their mortgages were a major impetus to consumer spending in the last year. "The jury is still out" on whether consumers can easily absorb the loss of that stimulus, he said.

Paul Ballew, GM's executive director for market and industry analysis, yesterday said that the company's disappointing June sales, to be detailed tomorrow, reflected the "ebbs and flows" after an unusually strong May sales performance. "I don't think anything has happened to the consumer," he said. Rival auto makers have said their June sales appear to be strong.

While the Fed's expected interest rate increase today will be the most visible sign that the era of cheap money is drawing to an end, the process actually began in April when long-term interest rates began rising in anticipation of the Fed tightening monetary policy. Banks likely will boost their prime lending rates, now 4%, in lockstep with any increase in the Fed's official rates.

An increased prime rate will quickly flow through to credit-card rates and some home-equity and consumer loans. But the impact on mortgages, a much larger share of overall consumer debt, will be muted. Fed officials have pointed out that 85% to 90% of household mortgages are fixed for 15 to 30 years, and thus won't be affected by rising interest rates for several years. Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, argued that about half of the remaining adjustable rate mortgages are in fact fixed for three to seven years. Further, adjustments often are capped at two percentage points a year. "Unlike the 1980s, no `ARM squeeze' is likely to sap discretionary spending power," he said in a recent report.

Mr. Berner noted that thanks to the creation of about one million new jobs since January and a modest acceleration in wage gains, wage and salary income is up about 5% from a year ago, before adjusting for inflation. That compares with zero growth two years ago. The additional income is worth $260 billion a year, he noted, enough to exceed the damping impact of interest rates.

While higher energy prices have sapped disposable income, their effect may be reversing bit. An end to supply disruptions in Iraq and Norway has caused some relief in world oil markets. The near-month futures contract on crude oil dropped below $36 Tuesday. They had been over $40 earlier this month.

Improved consumer confidence has helped President Bush's approval ratings on the economy pick up. A weekly consumer poll by ABC News and MoneyMagazine, released yesterday, found Republicans highly optimistic and Democrats deeply pessimistic about the economy. But in the last four weeks, independent voters -- who are among the swing voters being wooed by Mr. Bush and his Democratic rival, Sen. John Kerry -- have gone from more pessimistic than Democrats to significantly less so.

A CHART accompanying yesterday's World Stock Markets column incorrectly switched the labels on the federal-funds interest-rate target and the European Central Bank benchmark rate.

(WSJ July 1, 2004)

(END) 
   LPIT IS THE QUARTER POINT heard 'round the world -- and the trigger hasn't even been pulled yet.

As the Federal Reserve prepares to increase interest rates today, other central bankers will face pressure to follow suit, raising borrowing costs for corporations and governments world-wide. The Fed tipped its hand in April, so much of the world-wide market reaction already has taken place: Global bond yields have been rising and stocks falling. The dollar surged and is coming off its biggest six-week strengthening against a basket of foreign currencies since 2000.
   TDThat powerful and continuing response by the world's securities markets and central planners underscores the role the U.S. plays in the global economy, where the dollar acts as the world's reserve currency, its capital markets are the widest and deepest, and the American consumer is the prized target across the planet.

"In a globalized world economy, U.S. interest rates and the Fed sit at the heart of the system," says George Magnus, chief economist of the investment-banking division of UBS AG in London. "Japanese, Chinese, British and Italian companies and governments raise and use capital in U.S. dollars as well as their own currency."

The Fed announcement today at 2:15 p.m. EDT will be watched by millions outside the U.S., many staying up late to get the news. Most everybody is expecting a quarter-percentage-point increase in the benchmark federal-funds rate (to 1.25% from 1%), but the nail-biter will be in the details of what the Fed says about its intentions -- a statement that likely will move the markets one way or the other and provide speculators a chance to make some quick money.

"I suspect Hong Kong brokers, cellphones in hand, will be waiting for last call while watching the live feed from CNBC at 2:15 a.m.," says Tim McKenna, head of the New York sales desk for the brokerage house CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. He used to do the same himself when he was in Asia.

The immediate impact of the Fed's expected move will be to force all investment securities to offer higher competing returns. That likely will lead to even higher bond yields in Europe, emerging markets and maybe even Japan, where relatively low government yields recently hit a four-year high. Rising yields could continue to undermine stock markets, which have struggled for months despite healthy earnings prospects across the globe.

More ominously, rising U.S. rates could hinder the ability of the world's riskier companies to acquire financing. Highly indebted countries such as Brazil and Turkey may find it tougher to convince creditors to roll over their debt, especially if rates rise faster this year than expected or continue to rise well into next year.

Since consumer demand in Europe and Japan remains modest in comparison to the U.S., foreign investors are closely watching to see if the Fed move damps that demand. "To the extent that the Fed is acting to reduce growth prospects or control inflation risks, this will likely have a ripple effect around the globe," says David Scott, head of global fixed income for Citigroup Asset Management in London.

A rate increase would start to reverse a Fed policy that pushed short-term U.S. rates to their lowest levels in 46 years, dragging down European rates along with them. This easy-money policy fueled one of the biggest global stock-market rallies ever, drove the dollar down 27% against the euro and 18% against the yen since the start of 2002 and stoked a colossal mortgage boom. It accelerated global growth, pulling the world economy back from the jaws of deflation. Multinational corporations guzzled low-cost funds, enabling many with too much debt from the 1990s acquisition-boom years to clean up their balance sheets.

Now many monetary overseers are starting to reverse course. Central banks in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia already have raised rates. The Fed's move will increase pressure on others. "The Fed exerts more influence on global markets today than in the past," says Paul Donovan, a global economist at UBS in London.

The European Central Bank, overseeing a still-fragile economic recovery, is resisting the Fed's powerful pull. The economies of the dozen nations that use the euro are expected to expand a measly 1.8% this year, well below the global average forecast of 4.5%. At the ECB's monthly meeting tomorrow, policy makers likely will leave their key rate at 2%, where it has been since they cut rates a little more than a year ago. At a subsequent news conference, bank President Jean-Claude Trichet probably will try to tamp down suggestions that the ECB will be compelled to follow the Fed.

"Contrary to the Fed, the ECB at the moment is not leaning toward higher interest rates, but neither to lower," says Axel Weber, a member of the bank's governing council and the German central bank's president, in Die Zeit, the German weekly newspaper. "We're closely observing whether the economy is recovering and whether the labor market is improving."

Japanese traders and analysts say an increase in rates by the Fed won't force the Bank of Japan to abandon its zero-interest-rate policy immediately. They say a move by the Fed intensifies pressure to clarify when the Bank of Japan would begin raising rates or to take more aggressive steps to battle Japan's stubborn deflation, perhaps by setting an inflationary target.

Foreign bond markets aren't waiting for the major central banks to act and already feel the tug of higher U.S. rates. At the low point of March, 10-year German "Bunds" were yielding 3.85%. By the end of last week, the yields were up to 4.32%. "Higher U.S. bond yields have clearly exerted a pull on the euro-zone bond markets," says UBS's Mr. Magnus. In Tokyo, concerns about future inflation drove yields on the 10-year Japanese government bond to near a four-year high of 1.94% last week, raising the cost of servicing the massive public debt.

Emerging bond and stock markets look even more vulnerable. Rising U.S. rates make the more volatile developing countries less attractive and put additional pressure on their economies when borrowing rates go higher.

Yesterday's Market Activity

Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.2%, or 0.38 point, to 192.76. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 0.71%, or 1.08 points, to 150.43.

In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.2%, or 23.25 points, to 11860.81. Weaker-than-expected industrial-output data hurt sentiment. Supermarket operator Aeon rose 3.2% to 4,570 yen, and Mitsui Fudosan, Japan's largest real-estate developer, jumped 2% to 1,321 yen.

In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1%, or 6.3 points, to 4512.4. Mining stocks were hurt by weaker gold prices. Anglo American fell 1.6% to 1,138 pence.

                              Stepping Lightly 
 
  What the world's central banks, including the Federal Reserve under Alan 
Greenspan, have been up to lately: 
 
  Falling rates... 
 
U.S.: The Fed is expected to begin raising interest rates today with a 
quarter-point hike; officials have warned that the pace would quicken if 
inflation jumps.

likely won't raise rates until 2005. 
Current rate: 2% 
Latest move: Down (1/2-point)

 CLMTuesday's Markets   HDGlobal Markets Await Action by U.S. Fed --- Investors' Hearts Are Divided Over Good Earnings Prospects, Expected Higher Interest Rates   BYBy E.S. Browning    WC988 words   PD30 June 2004   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPINVESTORS ARE TRYING to put on a brave face as they prepare to take their interest-rate medicine today.

With the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates for the first time in four years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday managed a gain of 56.34 points, or 0.54%, to 10413.43. Bond prices also rose ahead of the Fed news.
   TDInvestors find themselves struggling with their emotions, trying to decide whether to feel upbeat at the prospect of strong second-quarter earnings due out next month or downcast at the prospect of an expected series of Fed rate increases. Investors fear the increases could last for a year or more as the Fed moves to rein in incipient inflation.

As it stands now, people are caught in the middle, unsure whether the bull market will withstand the rate increases or slowly crumble as the most stimulative government interest-rate policy in most people's adult lives comes to an end. The Fed's easy-money policy fueled the bull market at the end of 2002 and throughout last year, but uncertainty about the Fed's intentions has left the Dow industrials virtually unchanged, not only for the current quarter but for the year to date.

"The market is getting more comfortable with the certainty that rates are going to rise. The Fed has done a good job of forecasting its intention pretty clearly," said Andy Brooks, head of stock trading at Baltimore mutual-fund firm T. Rowe Price. But people remain unsure about inflation, the extent of the coming rate increases and the depth of international instability, he added. That has offset people's pleasure at the strong corporate earnings that the low interest rates have helped produce.

Stocks and bonds both fell Monday, in advance of the two-day Fed interest-rate meeting that ends today. Yesterday, they reversed course and rose.

Stocks got a boost from news that the Conference Board's consumer-confidence index this month jumped to its highest level in two years, reinforcing strong consumer-sentiment numbers reported by a rival University of Michigan index last week.

In the absence of major new international strife, crude oil fell to a three-month low of $35.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold also fell. The Dow Jones Transportation Average hit a fresh five-year high of 3184.71.

The Fed's announcement, scheduled for 2:15 p.m. EDT in Washington, is almost universally expected to involve a quarter-point increase in the Fed's target for the federal-funds rate to 1.25%. The rate, at which banks lend one another money overnight, has been at a 46-year low of 1% for the past year. Though some investors fear a half-point increase to 1.5%, that now is considered unlikely. How investors react to the Fed news will depend largely on what hints the Fed drops in its post-meeting statement about how much and how fast it will raise rates in the future.

The steady decline in Fed rates, which began at the start of 2001, has helped pull the U.S. economy out of recession, becoming one of the biggest underpinnings of the bull market that began in October 2002. Even after the expected boost today, rates will remain far below their levels of the late 1990s, and the Fed's target rate still will be well below zero when adjusted for inflation, which currently is running at an annual rate of more than 3%.

Though the reaction among bond investors has been milder than feared, the prospect of rising rates is worse news for bond investors than for stock investors.

The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond began the quarter at just 3.8% and rose to almost 4.9% on June 14 before stabilizing. Yesterday, as stocks rose, Treasurys also rose. The yield of the 10-year bond, which falls when the price rises, pulled back to 4.686%.

Many bond investors worry that the interest-rate increases, known in the trade as a "tightening cycle," could be a lengthy affair. Higher rates are much worse for Treasurys than for stocks, because stocks react both to corporate profits and to rates, while bonds depend almost entirely on interest rates. Rising rates hurt bond prices because they make new bonds, with their higher rates, more attractive than old ones.

"History suggests that the Fed is embarking on a tightening cycle of somewhere between one and two years' duration," David Kotok, president of money-management firm Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, N.J., wrote in a note to clients. The 10-year yield could go as high as 5.5% -- or even 6% if inflation forces the Fed into an aggressive stance, Mr. Kotok wrote.

Yesterday, the broad Standard &Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.25%, or 2.85 points, to 1136.20, leaving it up 2% on the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.75%, or 15.11 points, to 2034.93, up 1.6% this year.

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.37 billion shares traded, 1,713 stocks rose and 1,587 fell.

Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury bond rose 15/32 point, or $4.6875 for each $1,000 invested. The 30-year bond rose 22/32 point to yield 5.368%.

The dollar strengthened. It traded at 108.37 yen, up from 107.90, while the euro weakened to $1.2083 from $1.2186.

   LP* Consumer confidence leaps to two-year high

* Economists predict growth to falter next year
   TDA strong rise in US consumer confidence put further pressure on the US and international bond markets yesterday as traders prepared for the Federal Reserve to raise official interest rates by an expected 0.25 percentage points.

US Treasuries - which set the tone in international bond markets - have already experienced their worst returns in 24 years in the second quarter. After three years of interest rate cuts, investors have responded to a possible rate rise by selling bonds.

Bond prices fall - causing yields to rise - during periods of economic recovery. An economic upturn pushes up interest rates, reducing the appeal of bonds that offer a lower rate of interest.

The Fed is expected to raise interest rates today, ending 12 months in which the federal funds rate was at a 45-year low of 1 per cent. Rising interest rates will push up the cost of borrowing for governments, companies and individuals, although many companies have pre-empted the expected rate increase by raising funds before they were needed. Investment grade corporate bond issues fell 40 per cent in the first half of this year.

But higher rates should also make US Treasury bonds more attractive to foreign investors. These inflows have helped fund the high US current account deficit in recent months.

Consumer confidence, as measured by the US conference board, leapt to a two-year high of 101.9 in June from 93.1 in May, well above the consensus forecast of 95 per cent. This came towards the end of a quarter in which US Treasuries had suffered their biggest losses since late 1980. Lehman Brothers' US Treasury Aggregate Index fell by 3.77 per cent, its steepest drop since the 4.58 per cent fall in the third quarter of that year.

Analysts said most of this decline occurred in April and early May after sharp rises in employment numbers. "There was a sell-off in April but the market has been stable for two months," said Ciaran O'Hagan, strategist at Lehman Brothers. But John Roberts, head of government bond trading at Barclays Capital, said bond prices would fall further as the market priced in more rate rises.

The price of the 10-year US Treasury fell sharply on the announcement of the consumer confidence data, pushing the yield up to a day's high of 4.75 per cent. But it recovered later, allowing the yield to fall to 4.70 per cent. Yesterday, yields on 10-year bonds were 4.71 per cent from 3.84 per cent at the start of April. The yield on the rate-sensitive two-year note was at 2.84 per cent from 1.57 per cent.

Today's expected rate rise would kick off a tightening cycle that market participants expect would raise the Federal funds rate to 2.25 per cent this year and 3.75-4 per cent by the end of next.

The Bond Market Association yesterday released a forecast that the yield on the 10-year Treasury would rise to 5 per cent by September and to 5.5 per cent by the middle of next year. Its consensus forecast is that the economy will grow by 4.7 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent next. Capital Markets, Page 45

 SETHE AMERICAS   HDAlarm sounds for overheated housing market: Expected rises in interest rates have added urgency to concerns over US house prices, writes Christopher Swann.   BYBy CHRISTOPHER SWANN    WC925 words   PD30 June 2004   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   EDLondon Ed1   PGPage 9   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004 The Financial Times Limited.

   LPAs house prices in the US have surged in recent years there has been no shortage of economists warning that boom would eventually turn to bust. But as interestrate rises loom, such concerns are acquiring added urgency.

Since 1995, house prices in the US - after inflation - have climbed by 36 per cent, roughly double the increase of previous housing booms in the late 1970s and 1980s. After such a long period of price rises, the recent clamour to buy new homes ahead of interest rate increases is seen by some as typical of the last stages of a bull market.
   TDThe price of homes rose 6.3 per cent in real terms in the first three months of the year, according to official figures. That is just a touch below the 7 per cent rise at the end of last year, which was the fastest increase since the series began in 1975.

Few doubt that interest rate rises will soon bring the market under control, reducing the ability of new buyers to borrow enough to climb on to the first rung of the housing ladder.

But it is also possible that the upward move in interest rates this year will puncture a bubble in the housing market - leading to a fall in house prices, undermining consumer spending and slowing economic growth.

This remains a minority view but is becoming much more accepted than a year ago. A recent research paper by HSBC argues that house prices in the US are 10-20 per cent too high and that rate rises by the Federal Reserve will trigger a fall in prices by mid-2005.

Housing market optimists claim this is unlikely, and their faith is partly based on history. Since the second world war, house prices have never fallen over the course of a calendar year.

Second, the rise in prices has largely been justified by the lower cost of servicing home loans. Figures from the National Association of Realtors suggest that homes remain affordable. In April a family on a median income had 140 per cent of the income necessary to qualify for a mortgage to cover 80 per cent of the value of the median home.

Between 1990 and 2003, the income of the median family rose by close to 50 per cent. Combined with lower interest rates, the result has been a 130 per cent rise in the amount the median family could borrow to buy their home. Over the same period the house price index rose 72 per cent.

"Perhaps we should be asking why home prices did not rise even more under the circumstances," ponders a recent research paper by the New York Federal Reserve.

Finally, housing market optimists have claimed that there is no such thing as a US housing market, merely separate regional markets. Even if house prices fall in selected hot spots it is unlikely to be enough to throw the economy off course, they argue.

Ian Morris, US economist at HSBC, is wary of such complacency. First, he says, there is no justification for the claim that, nationally, house prices in the US never fall. After inflation, house price declines occured in 1975, 1979-82 and 1989-94.

On an even stricter measure - comparing the change in prices of houses of the same size - the historical record of housing looks even worse. The square footage of the median new house has risen from 1,500 in 1980 to 2,150 in 2003. "Adjust for this, and the 28-year average of real price growth in housing is zero per cent," Mr Morris says.

Second, while low interest rates make home buying affordable, they are also the flip side of low inflation - which means that debts will linger for longer.

In 1973 the real stock of debt was whittled away to just 30 per cent of its value five years later, according to HSBC. If the Fed manages to keep inflation to just 1.5 per cent a year, the value of 2003 debts will still be worth 80 per cent of their original value in five years.

In addition, although most Americans have fixed-rate mortgages, interest rate rises will gradually reduce the ability of first time buyers to borrow enough. A lack of demand at the bottom of the market could undermine the ability of all other households to move up the housing ladder.

Mr Morris also argues that overvaluation is geographically widespread, claiming that house prices look overvalued in a total of 20 states and Washington DC - representing just over 50 per cent of the US population.

The relationship between house prices and household incomes has got particularly out of kilter in California, where house prices have climbed to 6.4 times income, and in Washington DC, where they are 5.8 times income.

"There are plenty of areas that could be defined as bubble candidates - with price to income ratios above three - including Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia and many others," says Mr Morris.

With persuasive arguments on both sides, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep a wary eye on the housing market as it raises interest rates. Around Dollars 14,600bn (Euros 11,980bn, Pounds 7,900bn) of US household wealth is tied up in property and the Fed is acutely aware that any sharp deterioration in the market would be extremely damaging to economic growth.

   LPThe Swiss franc was bolstered by upbeat economic news in European morning trade on Wednesday, but most speculators were keeping their powder dry ahead of the impending interest rate announcement from the US Federal Reserve.

The Fed is almost universally expected to hike rates by 25 basis points from their 46-year-low of 1 per cent, the first tightening for four years. However most attention will be focussed on the accompanying statement, particularly if Alan Greenspan et al decide to remove the suggestion that the pace of tightening will be "measured", and instead talk about a return to "neutral" rates.
   TDWith the Fed meeting casting its shadow over the market, trading was range-bound. The Swiss franc was aided by the monthly Kof leading economic indicator, which rose to 1.07 in June from a revised 0.97 in May, helped by rising orders for industrial companies.

This allowed the Swissie to firm a centime to SFr1.2557 against the dollar, 0.5c to SFr 1.5248 versus the euro and 1.8c to SFr2.2706 against sterling.

The dollar itself drifted a little to $1.2146 against the euro, but firmed to Y108.92 against a broadly softer yen.

Elsewhere the Polish zloty firmed almost 1 per cent to 4.5106 zlotys to the euro, a nine-month high, after the Polish central bank hiked its range of key interest rates by 40 basis points, twice the increase expected by the market.

 HDFed ready to take decisive step     WC901 words   PD30 June 2004   SNAFX Asia   SCAFXASI   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004, AFX Asia. All rights reserved.  
   LPFed ready to take decisive step  
   TDWASHINGTON (AFX) - The Federal Reserve will almost certainly raise its overnight interest rate target for the first time in four years when the U.S. central bankers conclude their two-day meeting on Wednesday. After three years of recession and unsteady growth, the U.S. economy has finally hit its stride in 2004, creating enough new jobs, higher incomes (and higher prices) to allow the Federal Open Market Committee to breathe a sigh of relief as it gradually turns from accommodation to restraint. The extra stimulus provided by the Fed's extremely low interest rates aren't needed any longer. In fact, if left in place for much longer, such low rates could overheat the economy and fuel inflation, the argument goes. "Make no mistake about it; the Fed's upcoming move should not be interpreted as an attempt to brake an out-of-control economy," said Rich Yamarone, head of economics research at Argus Research. "This impending rate hike is more appropriately analogous to taking the foot off the accelerator." After a series of speeches by Fed officials, the market now expects a quarter-point increase when the Federal Open Market Committee makes its announcement at about 2:15 p.m. Wednesday. There's an outside chance that Fed could boost the fed funds by another quarter point, either at the meeting or sometime during July. "If the Fed had any intention of moving more, say 50 basis points [a half percentage point], the markets would already have been notified," said Yamarone. In the past 10 years, the Fed has become extremely proficient at communicating its near-term intentions. Fed's words Indeed, the only suspense from Wednesday's announcement is over the wording, whether the Fed will continue to signal a slow pace of tightenings or show more impatience. As of Tuesday, the fed funds market is expecting a steady stream of quarter-point increases through the end of the year, putting the target rate at 2.25 percent. No Fed rate hike has ever been so well telegraphed in advance. From Alan Greenspan down to the most junior Fed bank president, the drumbeat has been the same: It's time to raise interest rates, but only at a "measured" pace that will give everyone plenty of time to adjust. There's no sense of panic at the Fed; no second-guessing that the Fed has fallen behind the curve on inflation and must now take extraordinary measures to catch up. Greenspan himself delivered the message in an unusually blunt manner during his confirmation hearings earlier in the month, saying "our general view is that inflationary pressures are not likely to be a serious concern in the period ahead." Get ready Some markets, such as the extremely liquid Treasury market, have already fully adjusted to the prospect of higher rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note has risen nearly a percentage point since March (and more than 1 1/2 points since last June) in anticipation of tighter monetary policy. Mortgage rates have followed suit. Other markets or participants may not have fully adjusted to the new climate, but it won't be easy to know where the landmines are until they explode. There's plenty of sentiment in the market that the bond market has gone too far, expecting more and faster rate hikes than the Fed will actually deliver. "Markets appear to be overpriced for Fed tightening," said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for Merrill Lynch. He points to the wide spread between the 2-year yield and the 10-year yield, as well as the extent of the steepening in the 10-year yield ahead of the rate hike. "The historical record shows that 10-year Treasury yields are up some 40 basis points, on average, ahead of the first rate hike - not 170 basis points as is the case today," Rosenberg said. Time will tell who's right. Most economists don't expect a repeat of 1994, when the Fed took the markets by surprise with an aggressive tightening that doubled the fed funds rate from 3 percent to 6 percent in a year. In that year, the bond market was thrown for a loss, Orange County was forced to declare bankruptcy and Mexico's peso crisis nearly led to more defaults. This time, most businesses have taken advantage of the Fed's generosity by paring back their debts. Financial speculators have supposedly unwound the so-called carry trade of borrowing at short-term rates and lending at long-term.  

On the other hand, consumers have taken on loads of debt in the past three years, most of it at extremely low rates. Wait, wait Some voices still argue against a rate hike. Strange economic bedfellows James Galbraith and Jude Wanniski argued in an op-ed in the Washington Times that higher rates will slow the economy, fuel inflation, and hurt the auto and housing sectors. "America's problems cannot be solved by raising the overnight funds rate," Galbraith and Wanniski wrote. Galbraith is a liberal Democrat who favors Keynesian economics, while Wanniski is a Republican who helped popularize supply side economics. The only thing weirder than Galbraith and Wanniski agreeing would be if Greenspan also agrees. This story was supplied by CBSMarketWatch. For further information see  www.cbsmarketwatch.com.

 HDUS raises key  interest rate  for first time in four years     BYDJW     WC643 words   PD30 June 2004   ET23:09   SNAgence France Presse   SCAFPR   LAEnglish   CYCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2004 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON, June 30 (AFP) -  

US Federal Reserve policymakers Wednesday raised key interest rates for the first time in four years, embarking on a mission to slowly smother inflation.  
   TDThe Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to raise the federal funds target rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, to 1.25 percent from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent.  

It was the first in a series of small steps expected to gradually return the key rate to normalcy -- about 4.0 percent at the current inflation rate -- by the end of 2005.  

"Strong growth in the US economy coupled with a rise in inflation has induced the Fed into tightening monetary policy," said Swiss Re chief economist Kurt Karl said.  

"This is the first in many rate hikes, which will likely take the federal funds rate to 2.25 percent at the end of this year and 4.0 percent by the end of 2005."  

With inflation relatively low except for some apparently transitory hotspots, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues confirmed that they expected to move at a "measured" pace.  

Investors cheered the news, sending the Dow Jones industrials average up 22.05 points, or 0.21 percent, to 10,435.48.  

But the policymakers also vowed to do whatever is needed if inflation rears unexpectedly.  

"The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity," the FOMC said.  

The latest evidence showed the world's biggest economy was growing at a "solid pace" and job market had improved, FOMC members said in a statement.  

Risks to growth and inflation appeared balanced, they said.  

"Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."  

After a year of no change in rates and three years of cuts, investors sweated about the pace of future increases.  

"In 2005, the Federal Reserve could boost the interest rate at a faster rate if above trend growth chews up excess capacity, raising the core inflation rate," Wells Fargo Bank chief economist Sung Won Sohn warned.  

Greenspan and his colleages sprung into action only after a jobs drought broke, and prices began to rise.  

Since January 2001, they had cut rates steeply to offset the popping of the technology bubble in the late 1990s, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  

The tightening cycle begins at a delicate time, with President George W. Bush fighting for reelection November 2.  

But "it's a reflection that the economy is growing stronger," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said shortly before the announcement.  

Democratic presidential contender John Kerry's campaign avoided direct comment on the rate rise but said Bush's policies had put upward pressure on longer-term borrowing costs.  

"The real issue is that George Bush's abandonment of fiscal discipline will mean higher long-term interest rates," Kerry's economic advisor, Gene Sperling, said in a statement.  

Some areas of the economy may prove vulnerable to rising rates, analysts said.  

Higher interest rates tend to brake consumer spending by pushing up the cost of borrowing on credit cards, bank loans, and to slow the housing market by raising the cost of mortgage payments.  

Investors seemed wary.  

A survey by UBS and Gallup showed 52 percent of respondents believed the Federal Reserve should leave rates untouched over the next three months, 34 percent agreed with a rise and 11 percent backed a cut.  

Federal Reserve members also raised the discount rate, at which the central bank loans to commercial banks overnight, by the same quarter-point margin to 2.25 percent.

   LPWASHINGTON, June 30 (AFP) -  

US Federal Reserve policymakers Wednesday raised the federal funds target rate, which commercial banks charge each other, from a near rock-bottom 1.0 percent to 1.25 percent.  
   TDFollowing are the zones of the economy considered most vulnerable to rising interest rates:  

HOUSING  

Mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury bond yield, but the Federal Reserve's actions on short-term debt also tend to have an influence on longer-term obligations.  

Already, mortgage rates are creeping higher.  

"Though higher mortgage rates are likely to have the short-term effect of cooling off the housing market later this year, we have long said that the increases will not put a halt to either the building or the purchasing of new homes in the long run," said Wachovia economist Gina Martin.  

"People need a place to live, and the American preference is, without a doubt, to own that place."  

STOCKS  

Investors generally believe that share prices dislike rising interest rates but this is only partially true, according to Deutsche Bank economist Cary Leahey.  

In fact, stocks tend to rise before a rate increase and then retreat by less than five percent in the months after the event, often rallying again when the tightening cycle ends.  

If the 1994 cycle of rising interest rates is any guide, then share prices could swoon after the decision and then hold their ground until late 2004 before facing a difficult 2005, Leahey said.  

"But if inflation remains well contained and economic growth holds up, we think the stage could be set for a stronger 2006 for equities, particularly if the Fed stops the tightening process," he said.  

BONDS  

Bonds pay a fixed interest so their relative value is diminished as interest rates rise.  

But bond prices may have dropped too far in trying to account for the expected rise in US interest rates, some analysts said.  

Historically, 10-year Treasury bonds yields, which move in the opposite direction to prices, rise by an average 0.40 percentage points ahead of the first interest rate rise, not the 1.70 percentage points experienced this time, said Merrill Lynch chief North American economist David Rosenberg.  

"The bond bear looks long in the tooth, at least when benchmarked against its predecessors," Rosenberg said.  

CONSUMERS  

Higher interest rates tend to brake consumer activity by pushing up the cost of borrowing on credit cards, bank loans, and for home-buying or mortgage repayments.  

But Deutsche Bank's Leahey said the impact may be less than people expect, notably because US households are net savers.  

Also, about half of all debt, including consumer credit and mortgages, was probably locked in at fixed interest rates, Leahey said.  

"Higher interest rates could adversely affect household net worth or wealth by reducing the value of outstanding assets such as equities or housing," he said.  

It was hard to find a strong relationship between wealth and interest rates, because rates usually tightened at a time when the economy was strong and prices of houses and equities were rising, Leahey said.  

"But consumer spending is hurt during Fed tightenings," he conceded. During the 1994 cycle of rising interest rates, vehicle sales dropped by one million units and new house building crumbled, dropping by 200,000 homes in late 1994 and early 1995, he said.

US Federal Reserve policymakers Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in four years to pre-empt inflation in an expanding economy that is churning out new jobs.  
   TDThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to raise its target for the federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, to 1.25 percent from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent.

With inflation low except for some apparently transitory hotspots, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues said they expected to move at a "measured" pace.  

But the policymakers vowed to do whatever is needed if inflation rears unexpectedly.  

"The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity," the FOMC said.  

The latest evidence showed the world's biggest economy was growing at a "solid pace" and job market had improved, FOMC members said in a statement.  

"Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors," they said.  

Risks to growth and inflation appeared balanced, the FOMC said.  

"With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured," the policymakers said.  

"Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."  

After a year of no change in rates and three years of cuts, investors sweated about the pace of future increases.  

"In 2005, the Federal Reserve could boost the interest rate at a faster rate if above trend growth chews up excess capacity, raising the core inflation rate," Wells Fargo Bank chief economist Sung Won Sohn warned.  

Greenspan and his colleages sprung into action only after a jobs drought broke, and prices began to rise.  

Since January 2001, they had cut rates steeply to offset the popping of the technology bubble in the late 1990s, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  

The tightening cycle begins at a delicate time, with President George W. Bush fighting for reelection November 2.  

But "it's a reflection that the economy is growing stronger," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said shortly before the announcement.  

Some areas of the economy may prove vulnerable to rising rates, analysts said.  

Higher interest rates tend to brake consumer spending by pushing up the cost of borrowing on credit cards, bank loans, and to slow the housing market by raising the cost of mortgage payments.  

Investors seemed wary.  

A survey by UBS and Gallup showed 52 percent of respondents believed the Federal Reserve should leave rates untouched over the next three months, 34 percent agreed with a rise and 11 percent backed a cut.  

Federal Reserve members also raised the discount rate, at which the central bank loans to commercial banks overnight, by the same quarter-point margin to 2.25 percent.

US Federal Reserve policymakers Wednesday raised key interest rates for the first time in four years to pre-empt inflation in an economy now growing solidly and churning out jobs.  
   TDThe policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to raise its target for the federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, to 1.25 percent from a 1958 low of one percent.  

With inflation low except for some apparently transitory hotspots, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues said they expected to return rates to normal at a "measured" pace.  

But the policymakers vowed to do whatever is needed if inflation rears unexpectedly.

Wall Street shares swung higher immediately after the expected quarter-point interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve and its statement suggesting additional "measured" movement on rates.  
   TDThe Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed course after the announcement and moved up 12.68 points (0.12 percent) to 10,426.11 at 1827 GMT.  

The Nasdaq composite climbed 7.81 points (0.38 percent) to 2,042.74.  

John Hughes, market analyst at Shield's and Co., said the move was the "biggest non-surprise" of the year.  

"The commentary suggests that (Fed chairman Alan) Greenspan isn't overly concerned with inflation, so it makes sense that the 'measured pace' language remains," he said.  

"He specifically cited 'transitory concerns,' (on inflation) which tells me he sees issues like energy prices as temporary inflationary pressures rather than insistent ones."  

The Fed raised the key short-term interest rate for the first time in four years, pushing it up by a quarter point to 1.25 percent.  

"The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity," the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.

 HDFed to raise key US  interest rate , early anti-inflation shot     BYDJW     WC541 words   PD30 June 2004   ET16:36   SNAgence France Presse   SCAFPR   LAEnglish   CYCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2004 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON, June 30 (AFP) -  

US Federal Reserve policymakers were poised to raise interest rates for the first time in four years Wednesday, firing an early shot in an expected long-run anti-inflation campaign.  
   TDThe Federal Open Market Committee is set to raise the federal funds target rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent.  

The decision, to be announced at about 2:15 pm (1815 GMT) at the end of the two-day meeting, will mark a U-turn from nearly three years of interest rate cuts.  

"The central bank will hike the interest rate by a quarter point at each of the next five FOMC meetings in 2004," Wells Fargo Bank chief economist Sung Won Sohn predicted.  

Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan can afford to raise rates slowly because inflation, though rising, is under control, and he must avoid shocking the housing market and indebted investors, Sohn said.  

Further, the expansionary effects of recent massive tax cuts were slowing, he said.  

"The high price of oil associated with geopolitics and terrorism argues against taking too much economic risk at this time," he added.  

The interest rate, stuck at 1.0 percent for the past year, will can travel back to normal because of a break in a three-year jobs drought, a rise in prices, and gathering signs of sustainable economic growth.  

But as Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan met with his colleagues, fresh data stirred concern over the risk of a summer slowdown.  

A "business barometer" compiled from a survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago area fell 11.6 points to a seasonally adjusted 56.4 points in June -- the lowest since October 2003 -- while the prices paid index rose 4.5 points to 84.5 -- the highest since August 1988.  

Higher interest rates tend to brake consumer spending by pushing up the cost of borrowing on credit cards, bank loans, and for home-buying or mortgage repayments.  

Share prices, bond prices, and housing markets are also considered to be vulnerable.  

Investors seemed wary.  

A investors' survey by UBS and Gallup showed 52 percent of respondents believed the Federal Reserve should leave rates untouched over the next three months, 34 percent agreed with a rise and 11 percent backed a cut.  

Since January 2001, Greenspan has cut rates steeply to offset the popping of the technology bubble in the late 1990s, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  

He has promised to move at a "measured" pace in returning rates to normal, but he also has underscored his determination to move faster if he has to beat back unexpected vigor in inflation.  

The interest rate tightening cycle begins at a delicate time, with President George W. Bush fighting for reelection November 2.  

But the election would not dissuade policymakers from acting, Commerzbank Securities economist Peter Dixon said in a report.  

"The Fed will do what it has to do to fulfil its mandate of securing economic and financial stability, and certainly cannot be seen to be taking decisions for political reasons," he said.

   LPWASHINGTON, June 30 (AFP) -  

US Federal Reserve policymakers are near-certain to raise interest rates for the first time in four years Wednesday, analysts said, landing a risky, anti-inflation blow.  
   TDThe Federal Open Market Committee has all but announced in advance a plan to raise the federal fund target rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent.  

The decision will be announced at about 2:15 pm (1815 GMT) after a two-day meeting.  

Near rock-bottom rates, stuck for a year to stave off the slim risk of deflation, can climb because the jobs drought has broken and underlying prices appear to be on the rise, analysts said.  

The new climate brings risks, however.  

Housing prices could be vulnerable, analyst said, with mortgage rates already creeping up in anticipation.  

"Though higher mortgage rates are likely to have the short-term effect of cooling off the housing market later this year, we have long said that the increases will not put a halt to either the building or the purchasing of new homes in the long run," said Wachovia economist Gina Martin.  

Share prices and bond prices may also be depressed, at least in the immediate aftermath.  

"But if inflation remains well contained and economic growth holds up, we think the stage could be set for a stronger 2006 for equities, particularly if the Fed stops the tightening process," said Deutsche Bank economist Cary Leahey.  

Higher interest rates tend to brake consumer spending by pushing up the cost of borrowing on credit cards, bank loans, and for home-buying or mortgage repayments.  

Investors seemed cautious.  

A survey by UBS and Gallup showed 52 percent of respondents believed the Federal Reserve should leave rates untouched over the next three months, 34 percent agreed with a rise and 11 percent backed a cut.  

Nevertheless, consumer confidence shot to a two-year high this month, catapulted by a jobs boom and solid economic prospects, a survey by the Conference Board showed Tuesday.  

The consumer confidence index, compiled from a survey of 5,000 households, leapt 8.8 points to 101.9, the economic research group said.  

It was the strongest showing since June 2002.  

"This is good news for economic growth as the more confident people are, especially about their jobs, the more they may be willing to spend," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.  

"For the Fed, this is just another reason to raise the funds rate tomorrow. How far and how fast depends upon inflation."  

Since January 2001, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has cut rates steeply to offset the popping of the technology bubble in the late 1990s, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  

Greenspan has promised to move at a "measured" pace in returning rates to normal, but he also has underscored his determination to move faster if he has to beat back unexpected vigor in inflation.  

Latest data released Monday showed prices paid by consumers, tracked by the personal consumption expenditure index, rose 0.5 percent in May, a 15-month high.  

Stripping out food and energy, however, core prices were up 0.2 percent, the Commerce Department said.  

Even if the Federal Reserve statement Wednesday failed to highlight the risk of inflation, "that will not fool anyone," Naroff said.  

If fresh data showed prices moving steadily higher, "the already upward-revised fed funds forecasts will be revised upward again," the economist said.  

Greenspan and his colleagues embark on the interest rate tightening cycle at a delicate time, with President George W. Bush fighting for reelection November 2.  

But the election would not dissuade policymakers from acting, Commerzbank Securities economist Peter Dixon said in a report.  

"The Fed will do what it has to do to fulfil its mandate of securing economic and financial stability, and certainly cannot be seen to be taking decisions for political reasons," he said.

 HDDollar Strengthens Against Major Rivals     WC404 words   PD29 June 2004   ET23:40   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Boosted by increased U.S. consumer confidence, the dollar strengthened across the board Tuesday as investors began squaring positions ahead of an expected Federal Reserve rate hike on Wednesday.  

After spending most of the previous day under pressure, the dollar rebounded Tuesday on data showing the New York-based Conference Board's U.S. consumer confidence index had climbed to 101.9 in June from 93.1 in May, well above economists' forecasts of 95.  
   TDHowever, the Fed's interest rate decision and a subsequent slew of economic data later in the week will determine whether the dollar extends or unwinds those gains, said traders.  

"The correlation between the Fed's message and the dollar is tremendous," said Greg Schwake, vice president of proprietary trading at Fortis Bank in New York.  

By late afternoon, the euro had slid to $1.2083, below $1.2191 in New York late Monday.  

The dollar was at 108.37 yen, above 107.95 a day earlier. The British pound, hurt by weaker U.K. house price inflation numbers, was at $1.8067, below $1.8302 late Monday. The dollar was up sharply against the Swiss franc at 1.2671 from 1.2477.  

Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar strengthened after the ruling Liberal Party held onto power after Canadian national elections, although reduced to minority-government status. The U.S. dollar traded at 1.3459 Canadian dollars from around 1.3468 late Monday.  

Financial markets are nearly unanimous in expecting the Fed to lift interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, in what would be the first hike in four years.  

An even more important indicator, traders said, will be the language included in the FOMC's accompanying statement, which investors will parse for clues to the pace of future Fed tightening. Some analysts have argued that the Fed is not being aggressive enough to combat rising U.S. inflation -- fears that were highlighted Monday when data showed large increases in May personal spending and income.  

"That's the main area of suspense," said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington, adding that the dollar is likely to weaken if Fed policy-makers maintain their recent tone on rate hikes and pledge to move forward at a "measured" pace for the rest of the year.

 HD Interest rate  hikes to pinch credit card holders      BYBy JANE J. KIM      CRDow Jones Newswires   WC698 words   PD29 June 2004   ET06:15   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - If you've been lulled into carrying large balances on your low-interest credit cards, prepare your wallet for a rude awakening.   

At its meeting this week, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point -- the first of what is thought to be a series of gradual rate boosts.   
   TDWhile that's good news for fixed-income investors, who will soon benefit from higher income payments, it could soon spell the end of good times for borrowers.   

That's because the cost of carrying credit-card debt will get more expensive as rates rise. Most credit cards are tied to the prime rate, which banks raise or lower in lockstep with the Fed's moves.   

In a rising rate environment, experts say it's likely that more issuers will move to variable rates, since that structure is not only more profitable, but it also gives them the flexibility to protect their margins as their cost of funds increase.   

For example, in its latest quarterly filing, MBNA Corp. said a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates in the next 12 months could reduce its projected net income by about $67 million.   

The company said it could offset its costs by repricing fixed-rate credit card loans, but noted that there's a lag of about 45 days between rate hikes and repricings.   

Currently, about 41 percent of bank cards are variable-rate cards, while 59 percent are fixed, said Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com.   

As rates rise, that's likely to shift to 70 percent variable and 30 percent fixed -- a mix that was typical for most of the 1990s, he said.   

When rates were falling in the past several years, many issuers began offering more fixed-rate cards.   

That's why it's important to watch for any change in terms in your monthly statements.   

In the meantime, take advantage of any fixed-rate offers that come your way, because you're probably not going to see many of those offers in the future.   

Given the breadth of card products that issuers offer, consumers probably won't see an across-the-board rate change.   

Rather, issuers are more likely to change segments of their portfolios or tweak rates on their new card offers.   

Earlier this year, Discover Financial, a unit of Morgan Stanley, notified some of its Platinum card members that the standard annual percentage rate on purchases would be changed to a variable rate from a fixed rate, effective April 1.   

The company said it periodically reviews customers' accounts and, based on "several factors and credit attributes," will raise and lower their interest rates.   

Fixed rates are still offered on some of its Platinum and Classic cards, the company said.   

Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank unit -- which used to offer fixed purchase rates on certain credit cards -- now only offers variable rates on purchases, with the exception of fixed promotional and introductory rates, the company said.   

Meanwhile, some card issuers have changed the so-called punitive rates -- rates that kick in if customers are late with their payments or overspend their accounts -- on cards to variable from fixed.   

Last July, for example, Bank One Corp. switched its penalty-rate structure on many of its cards to the prime rate plus 20.99 percent, from 24.99 percent, to bring its rates in line with market rates, the company said.   

You're also likely to see rate changes reflected in new card offers. "If you look at any of the new offers, it's hard to find a 'go-to' fixed rate anymore," said McKinley, referring to the rate that kicks in after the teaser rates expire.   

And just because you've got a fixed-rate card doesn't mean you're safe. Issuers can change or adjust rates with as little as 15 days notice.   

Currently, average interest rates on variable-rate cards are 13.53 percent compared with average rates of 12.79 percent on fixed-rate cards, said Greg McBride, an analyst at Bankrate.com.

 CLMMonday's Markets   HDRally Fizzles Ahead of 2-Day Fed Meeting   BYBy Ian McDonald    WC627 words   PD29 June 2004   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPTHE EARLY HANDOVER of power in Iraq and positive U.S. economic news fueled a rally in stocks that ran out of gas in the afternoon.

Cheered by the prospect of a stronger economy at home and perhaps less risk to Iraqi pipelines, investors pushed down the price of oil and boosted the prices of U.S. stocks and bonds in the morning. Oil dropped 3.5% to $36.24 per barrel, its steepest drop in more than two months, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 90 points at one juncture, as economic data showed that personal spending in May rose by the highest margin in more than two years.
   TDBut then the good vibes wore off and stocks finished the day narrowly in the red. Some investors blamed news of slipping June sales at General Motors and a flare-up of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

"We're in muddle mode, with up mornings and down afternoons," said Jeffrey Saut, chief strategist at brokerage firm Raymond James.

Other explanations ranged from heavy selling in derivatives markets by hedge funds to the rejiggering of market-index components. The only certainty: Once again, stocks couldn't get much traction.

Investors are also focused on the meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers that begins today; the Fed is widely expected to raise its target interest rate one-quarter percentage point at the meeting's end tomorrow afternoon.

Yesterday, the Dow industrials closed down 14.75 points, at 10357.09. Running in place has been a theme for the blue-chip index all year, which is down just 0.61 point from where it started the second quarter. The broader Standard &Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.08 points to 1133.35 and is up only 0.6% for the second quarter.

The Dow Jones Transportation Average, comprising airlines and other transport companies, which would be helped by lower fuel costs, closed at 3177.97. That was its highest level since August 1999, though it rose just 0.44% yesterday.

Even the morning's seemingly bright spots gave cynics dry powder. The handover in Iraq looked like good news but won't do much to secure Iraq's oil pipelines if insurgents forge ahead with attacks planned for tomorrow to coincide with when the U.S.-led coalition originally had intended to give Iraq back its sovereignty.

"It's good news, but we have to be realistic," said Robert MacIntosh, a fixed-income fund manager with Boston-based Eaton Vance. "Things could change quickly when the first bomb blows up."

On closer inspection, the seemingly upbeat personal-spending report from the Commerce Department gave investors an additional reason to worry. The data indicated that inflation is still on the rise, perhaps leading some to wonder if the Fed's much-anticipated rate increase could be larger than expected. Rising interest rates sap bond prices and can hurt the earnings of financial-services firms.

"I think these numbers fit right into the Fed's script," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at consulting firm Economy.com. "My only concern is that the inflation statistics might induce the Fed to [raise rates] more aggressively."

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks and bonds fell. The 10-year Treasury note fell 24/32, or $7.50 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 4.743% from 4.648% Friday.

The dollar was mixed. It was at 107.90 yen, up from 107.65 Friday; the euro rose against the dollar to $1.2186 from $1.2159.

 HDRising Interest Rates Have Many Cheerleaders --- Retirees, Professional Investors, Others With Conservative Assets Look Forward to Higher Yields   BYBy Aaron Lucchetti    WC1,074 words   PD29 June 2004   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPSEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S fretting that rising interest rates will tank their stock-market holdings and drive up mortgage costs. Everybody, that is, except retirees like Ron and Pat Priore and other savers who have money tucked away in the modern equivalent of a mattress.

When the Federal Reserve starts increasing its target short-term interest rate, as it is expected to do tomorrow, it will boost long-dormant yields in the financial world's most-conservative investments -- money-market funds, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. That is where many of the nation's roughly 35 million people age 65 and older, as well as investment scaredy-cats of all ages, have a combined $5.5 trillion tucked away, much of it producing razor-thin returns near or below 1% a year. The Fed's expected increase of one-quarter percentage point would mean an additional $14 billion a year in income for these investors.
   TD"Rising rates would be very, very good for us," says Pat Priore, a retired math teacher who lives with her husband in suburban Chicago. "It's exactly what we're looking for."

The couple, both 71 years old, has about half of their six-figure savings in a fixed-interest account that pays about 3% but, like a CD, ties up their money for a time. Once rates go up, they plan to reinvest that money to generate more income that they will use to travel, eat out more and shop at Marshall Field's and Nordstrom, instead of the discount outlets they have favored during recent years.

Retirees aren't the only ones rubbing their hands with glee over the coming rate rises. Younger savers building up cash for a down payment on a house or who just sold one will see their money earn a higher yield. So will people who are using conservative investments for defensive parking places to help them ride out rocky stock and bond markets. This group includes professional investors, many of whom have increased such holdings.

Many people, not just retirees, "want higher interest rates," says David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &Poor's, who has met with investors around the country this year while giving dozens of presentations on the economy.

Philippa Straus, a 41-year-old homemaker and former corporate attorney in Birmingham, Ala., and her husband recently shifted about 20% of their portfolio from bonds to a tax-exempt municipal money-market fund, leaving 40% of their holdings in conservative interest-based investments. "I've been selling to protect our gains," she says.

D.J. Petruccelli, the head of the Fort Myers Beach, Fla., Chamber of Commerce, keeps about 15% of his assets in certificates of deposit he hopes to reinvest at higher rates when they mature later this year. Now 76 but not yet retired, he plans to use the extra money to help pay for his grandchildren's college costs.

The joy such investors find in rising interest rates reflects a growing movement toward safer investments in the aftermath of the big stock-market downturn that began in 2000. U.S. households and nonprofit organizations had a record $5.5 trillion in CDs, money-market funds and checking and savings accounts at the end of the first quarter of this year, up 5.6% from the prior year and 26% since 2000 according to Federal Reserve data. By contrast, stock-market holdings by U.S. households and nonprofits have declined nearly 24% to $5.83 trillion since the end of 2000, despite last year's stock-market rally. (The figures don't include stock owned through mutual funds.)

About 30% of U.S. money managers surveyed by Merrill Lynch also are holding more conservative interest-based investments now than usual, up from 17% in January. These investments, called simply cash by many professionals, include Treasury bills, commercial paper, short-term repurchase agreements and money-market funds. Rising rates also could help some businesses, including purveyors of money-market funds, many of whom have been absorbing expenses that they normally charge investors to keep returns in positive territory.

More broadly, rising rates could discourage consumers from taking on more debt, while encouraging higher consumer-savings rates. But the big threat is inflation, which could wipe out any benefits of rising rates for consumers. By raising borrowing costs, the Fed would be trying to head off inflationary pressures.

That doesn't bother Rene Braun, a retired doctor from Sedona, Ariz., who moved about $20,000 from Treasury and municipal-bond mutual funds to Fidelity Cash Reserves Fund in recent months after becoming convinced bonds were about to take a beating. (Unlike cash investments, existing bonds fall in value when interest rates rise because new ones pay higher yields.) Mr. Braun, 78, plans to return to bonds or stocks when interest rates have stabilized at higher levels. But he is taking his time. He figures he already has saved $5,400 by moving to cash this spring.

Rates already have started inching up. The average yield on a one-year CD for example has risen to 1.48% from 1.11% in April, according to Bankrate.com. Since April, the average money-market fund yield has edged up to 0.56% from 0.51%, reaching the highest level since June 2003, according to Peter Crane, vice president and managing editor of iMoneyNet in Westborough, Mass.

Mr. Crane has a personal reason to root for higher interest rates. His father, Thomas Crane of New Port Richey, Fla., has about 60% of his $500,000 portfolio in money-market funds and short-term CDs, and says rising yields would give him more money to visit his son.

The yields on "money-market funds have been so low, it's outrageous," says the elder Mr. Crane, 71, who has bought a few dividend-paying stocks to boost his income.

When rates rise, he says, he will look for a long ocean cruise instead of less-expensive gambling cruises he has recently gone on. He also will expand his restaurant selection beyond early-bird specials and "free lunch" investment seminars. And when the menu comes, he says, he will replace his usual hamburger with prime rib. "That's an easy one," he says.

 SECOMMENT &ANALYSIS   HDInterest rates: has Alan Greenspan underestimated the pace of inflation?: Preparing the ground early to minimise shock to economy FOMC MEETING: The  Federal Reserve 's policymaking board faces the task of tightening monetary policy without derailing the economy-while containing rising prices, writes Andrew Balls.   BYBy ANDREW BALLS    WC2,495 words   PD29 June 2004   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   EDLondon Ed1   PGPage 19   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPThe final chapter of Alan Greenspan's tenure as the chairman of the US Federal Reserve will begin tomorrow with what will be a turning point in the Fed's recent history. Its policy-setting board is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-point, the first rise since May 2000, kicking off a tightening cycle that is likely to fill the remainder of Mr Greenspan's term, which is expected to end in 2006.

This will bring to an end an extraordinary period in US economic history in which the Fed slashed the federal funds rate to a 45-year low of 1 per cent in response to the bursting of the stockmarket bubble and its aftermath, terrorist attacks, war and last year's concern that deflation was a serious risk in the US.
   TDFollowing an extended period of such enormous monetary stimulus, the Fed has placed an unprecedented emphasis on its communications with the market to prepare the ground for this week's interest rate increase. The futures markets have priced in a series of interest rate increases that are expected to raise the Federal funds rate to 2.25 per cent by the end of the year and to 3.75-4 per cent by the end of 2005.

This would return interest rates to the bottom of a 4-5 per cent "neutral" range at which the Fed has its foot on neither the accelerator nor the brake. It would represent a smooth return to monetary policy normality, in line with the Federal Open Market Committee's guidance that low inflation and spare capacity mean it is likely to raise rates at a measured pace.

The cloud on the horizon is the unexpected rise in inflation in the first half of this year, which was as much a surprise to Federal Reserve policymakers as last year's drop in inflation. Already economists, inside the Fed as well as outside, are asking whether the risk now is of rising inflation.

"The Federal Reserve has underestimated inflation this year grossly and in a big way," says Allen Sinai, president of Decision Economics, the consultancy. "A central bank that underestimates inflation by that much must take a very close look at its processes".

In February Mr Greenspan told Congress that the central tendency of the FOMC's forecasts pointed to inflation of 1-1.25 per cent this year.

The personal incomes report for May, released yesterday, showed the personal consumption expenditure index had risen 2.5 per cent over the past 12 months.

The core PCE, which excludes food and energy and is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose 1.6 per cent over the past year. A rate of 1-2 per cent for the 12-month rate of core PCE inflation is generally seen as the Fed's unofficial "comfort range".

The rise in headline inflation owes much to higher prices for energy and other commodities in the first half - a threat that now appears to have receded. But the rise in core inflation is harder to explain.

With the Federal funds rate at such a low level, real interest rates in negative territory, and the economy growing faster than its long-term trend, some economists accuse Mr Greenspan and his colleagues of being behind the curve.

Concern about the risk of deflation and the weakness of the US labour market had prompted the FOMC to state last August that it believed policy accommodation could be maintained "for a considerable period".

That strategy helped to keep long-term interest rates down while the Fed waited for signs that a robust labour market recovery was under way, the last piece of the puzzle. Following strong jobs reports this year, the FOMC has started to give itself greater flexibility through incremental changes to its policy statements. These changes have included dropping the commitment to keep rates on hold for a considerable period, saying instead that it would be patient in raising rates and, at its May meeting, that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace "that is likely to be measured".

The Fed's communications strategy, which last year helped to hold down long-term interest rates, has this year encouraged investors to price in the tightening cycle in advance. This is in contrast to 1994, when the Fed's aggressive interest rate rises - adding 300 basis points to the Federal funds rate in 12 months - took the market by surprise and had reverberations from Orange County to Mexico City and beyond (see below).

Ten years later, before the Fed has lifted a finger, the market has tightened financial conditions, raising the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by 100 basis points over the past three months. But some observers - and some members of the FOMC judging by the board's minutes - are concerned that the Fed's focus on communicating with the markets may have constrained its room for monetary manoeuvre.

"What the Federal Reserve would like to do for the time being is to baby the market along, to say: 'Be relatively comfortable as we are only going to tighten a little here and there'," says Henry Kaufman, the veteran Wall Street economist. "But the Federal Reserve is trying to give guidance to the market that is beyond (its) analytical capabilities. From my perspective, it would be better off from here not to talk about measured responses but to say that it will do whatever is necessary to maintain economic stability - and leave it at that."

Fed officials, led by Mr Greenspan, have already taken steps to emphasise that they are predicting rather than pledging to raise interest rates at a measured pace based on our "current best judgment of how economic and financial forces will evolve in the months and quarters ahead".

Some observers expect the Fed further to stress the conditionality of its "measured pace" prediction in the statement following its meeting tomorrow.

The Fed's inflation forecast is based on companies' mark-up of prices over costs, augmented by models of labour market slack and capacity utilisation that determine the expected rate at which costs and prices rise.

The model also incorporates price-level shocks, changes in productivity growth and changes in inflation expectations.

However, the Fed's model failed to foresee a jump in core inflation in the first half of the year. This is because the unemployment rate - at 5.6 per cent - is well above the 5 per cent or so that policymakers see as consistent with stable inflation; manufacturing capacity utilisation, at about 75 per cent, is below the long-term average of 80 per cent, and there is a gap between actual and potential in gross domestic product, indicating slack in the economy.

Don Kohn, an influential Fed governor close to Mr Greenspan, gave a clear explanation of the Fed's prevailing view on inflation in a recent speech.

Mr Kohn argues that the rise in core inflation is best understood as a rebound after temporary effects that depressed inflation last year, chief among them a drop in the cost of home ownership. Although energy and commodity price increases raised the headline inflation rate in the first half of the year, long-term inflation expectations have remained fairly stable, according to Mr Kohn.

A slowdown in productivity growth and rising wage costs mean that unit labour costs have started to rise. But historically high corporate profit margins mean that this need not immediately feed into higher prices. The degree of economic slack means that the Fed does not need not hurry to return interest rates to a neutral level but rather can do so gradually over the next 18-months or so.

"It is a plausible analysis. But it also hinges on a number of assumptions about how the world works and has been working that are somewhat tenuous," said Michael Prell, an economics consultant and former director of research at the Fed. "When you go back and look, there is only a loose relationship between the output or unemployment gap and inflation. It is not in itself a compelling predictor of inflation."

Of course, Mr Kohn and other policymakers stress the difficulties in forecasting inflation accurately and the considerable uncertainties that surround the baseline outlook.

Indeed, because of the difficulties in forecasting inflation Mr Greenspan places great emphasis on analysis of current conditions. He focuses on the costs and profitability of different kinds of businesses, particularly unit labour costs since labour accounts for roughly two-thirds of total business costs.

Strong productivity growth over the past two years meant that unit labour costs fell but they have now started to rise because of a rise in wage costs and slower productivity. But as long as unit labour costs rise at a moderate pace, inflation should be similarly subdued.

Mr Greenspan has emphasised the importance of the profit cycle in recent public comments. In his judgment the rise in inflation over the past year is explained by rising profits at a time when costs have been subdued. Profits of non-financial corporations fell to 7 per cent of sector output in 2001 but margins rebounded to 12 per cent in the first quarter of this year - the fastest growth in margins for 20 years.

In part this reflects a return in pricing power to companies. Margins have now reached the upper end of their historical range. As labour costs rise, companies might be expected to absorb the increase in their margins, to protect market share.

Mr Greenspan's reputation rests on having got a number of monetary policy calls right since his appointment in 1987. The institution he leads has built up considerable credibility as an inflation-fighter over the past two decades.

In spite of the rise in inflation in the first half of the year and the uncertainty over the underlying rate of inflation, there is little sign in the financial markets that the Fed risks letting inflation get out of control.

In his book, A Term at the Fed, Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor and the founder of the Macroeconomic Advisers consultancy, describes what he calls the Fed's monetary policy "play book". This may help to understand the Fed's current strategy.

The Fed sets itself a higher hurdle when changing direction than in continuing with an established policy path on interest rates.

Fed officials believe the risks of making an error are greatest at turning points in the economy and so wait for clear evidence before making a change in direction. Second, it is an inevitable consequence of Mr Greenspan's "risk management" approach which takes into account events that have a low probability of happening. Third, and as a consequence, the Fed will be aggressive in reversing course if need be.

The current thinking of Mr Greenspan and his colleagues is that low inflation and spare capacity will allow the central bank to raise interest rates at a measured pace, but this prediction is not cast in stone.

"One thing the Fed takes very seriously is inflation expectations," Mr Meyer says. "The committee will move aggressively if inflation expectations are rising or if the data demand it. But there is little point in anchoring inflation expectations if you cannot take advantage of this to wait and assess the data."

It is unlikely that the Federal Reserve will be able to raise interest rates after a prolonged period of cheap credit without causing some pain to households, business and investors, economists warn.

But in contrast to a decade ago, the US central bank has devoted considerable effort to preparing the ground for higher rates, providing ample time for adjustment. Moreover, based on the Fed's expectation that it will be able to raise interest rates at a measured pace, they are set to remain at historically low levels for some time.

The greatest risks to the outlook come if the central bank is forced to raise rates much more sharply than is currently expected to curb inflationary pressures - dampening consumer spending and business confidence.

"So far things have happened in an orderly fashion. If inflation stays low and the Fed stays measured then the adjustment should be smooth," says Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank.

Ben Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, contrasts the Fed's preferred "gradualism" to a "cold turkey" approach to raising interest rates. Gradualism allows policymakers to judge how higher rates are affecting the economy, whereas a cold turkey approach requires the central bank to make that judgment in advance.

Consumer spending supported the US economy during a period of subdued business spending, with household spending bolstered by mortgage equity withdrawals and tax cuts. Rising incomes should support consumer spending as those other stimuli are removed.

The high level of household debt is a source of vulnerability. But a rising housing market over the past several years has bolstered household balance sheets. Most mortgage borrowers have fixed-rate loans, which lock in low interest rates.

Companies have similarly used the low interest rates over the past few years to strengthen their balance sheets. Strong corporate profitability will allow companies to finance investment internally.

A gradualist approach seeks to reduce risks to financial market instability since it gives financial institutions more time to adjust to the increase in short-term financing costs and reduce the chances of swings in bond prices that might catch some institutions by surprise.

Emerging market bond yields have also risen in concert with US Treasuries over the past three months. According to Mohamed El-Erian, head of emerging markets fund management at Pimco, the bond fund, this suggests that emerging market valuations have already adjusted to the prospect of higher interest rates in the US.

Apart from the clear communications by the Fed of its intentions, there have been a number of changes in emerging market economies over the past decade including stronger banking systems and fewer fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate regimes. A greater number of emerging market economies are running current account surpluses and building foreign exchange reserves which provide insurance against loss of market access in the short term.

International investors also have more information on debt and reserves - particularly after the Asian financial crisis - which reduces the scope for unpleasant surprises.

There is a danger for emerging markets if the Fed is forced to take more aggressive action to curb inflation, which could affect investor risk appetite and could lead to a disruption in capital flows.

But this is likely only if the Fed is forced to raise interest rates much more sharply than investors currently expect.

 SEINTERNATIONAL ECONOMY   HDBIS warns big economies of 'future shocks'.   BYBy ED CROOKS    WC614 words   PD29 June 2004   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   EDLondon Ed1   PGPage 13   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2004 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPLeading economies will need "an unusual degree" of tightening of both monetary and fiscal policy to give themselves room to manoeuvre in response to future shocks, says the Bank for International Settlements.

Speaking on the last day of the bank's annual general meeting in Basel yesterday, Malcolm Knight, the BIS's general manager, said: "Interest rates need to go to levels that are more neutral and maybe even restrictive in some countries, depending on inflation prospects going forward."
   TDThis week, the US Federal Reserve is expected to raise its main interest rate for the first time since 2000. The BIS, the forum for co- operation between the world's central banks, warned in its annual report that the challenge for the Fed and its counterparts worldwide was how to tighten policy without destabilising the global economy.

Raising US interest rates too fast, at a time when there are concerns about the durability of the recovery and there is significant slack in the economy, "is very likely to entail real economic costs", the BIS said.

Raising rates too slowly could lead to future inflation and encourage the further build-up of debt, that could "weigh down the real economy over time".

Nout Wellink, BIS president and president of the Netherlands' central bank, said relatively high levels of unemployment and spare capacity in manufacturing worldwide meant there was no immediate prospect of worldwide inflation that would demand "substantial interest rate rises".

But the BIS report stressed that the past few years had seen an unusually strong stimulus to growth from fiscal and monetary policy, particularly in the US.

"Once the robustness of the expansion has been confirmed, the need to re-establish policy flexibility will call for an unusual degree of fiscal and monetary rebalancing going forward," the report said.

The European Central Bank, which takes its next interest rate decision the day after the Fed, on Thursday, is not generally expected to follow suit with an interest rate rise until at least the turn of the year.

However, Joachim Fels of Morgan Stanley argued that rising expectations of eurozone inflation could force the ECB to move faster than the markets currently suggest.

"Measures of inflation expectations from index-linked bonds, from consumer and business surveys and from economists' forecasts have all been creeping up," he said.

"None of these indicators is perfect, but taken together they tell you something, and across the board they all point in the same direction."

* China and France were the most popular locations for foreign direct investment last year, overtaking the US for the first time, new figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show.

Earlier data had suggested a sharp recovery in FDI inflows into the US last year but the recently revised figures now show a steep fall, from an inflow of Dollars 72bn (Pounds 40bn) in 2002 to Dollars 40bn in 2003.

FDI inflows were Dollars 53bn for China and Dollars 47bn for France last year, in both cases only slightly down on 2002.

Ireland and Italy attracted small increases but many European countries suffered declines similar to the US. FDI into the UK halved from 2002, and in Germany it fell by two-thirds.

There were sharp falls in central Europe's accession countries: FDI in Slovakia fell 85 per cent, and in the Czech Republic 70 per cent.

Hans Christiansen, an economist at the OECD, said: "Three of the countries that participated the most in the tech party of the 1990s - the US, the UK and Germany - are still suffering these big falls in FDI." See Comment &Analysis

 HDDollar gains ahead of expected Fed rate hike     BYBUR     WC334 words   PD30 June 2004   ET00:15   SNAgence France Presse   SCAFPR   LAEnglish   CYCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2004 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved.  
   LPNEW YORK, June 29 (AFP) -  

The dollar gained Tuesday against major currencies ahead of expected US interest-rate hikes and on news that US consumer confidence had shot up in June to its highest level in two years.  
   TDAt 2100 GMT, the euro was worth 1.2081 dollars, down from 1.2121 late Monday.  

The dollar bought 108.22 yen, up from 108.15 the previous day.  

The British pound was worth 1.8067 dollars, against 1.8302 late Monday, while the dollar was worth 2.2868 Swiss francs, up from 2.2854.  

The consumer confidence index, compiled by the Conference Board economic research group from a survey of 5,000 households, rose 8.8 points to 101.9, the strongest showing since June 2002.  

"Looking ahead, consumers expect the economy to continue to grow at a healthy clip and to continue to generate additional jobs," Conference Board consumer research chief Lynn Franco said in a statement.  

"And, with (gasoline) prices at the pump beginning to ease, the short-term outlook remains favorable."  

While the data was encouraging, analysts said it was unlikely to alter expectations of a quarter-point rate hike Wednesday from the US Federal Reserve.  

"This won't change expectations about tomorrow but confirms that the economy is improving fairly well," said Mitul Kotecha, currency strategist at CALYON.  

"Over the short-term the data will boost the dollar and weigh on fixed income markets, but the reaction is likely to be limited ahead of the (Federal Reserve) meeting."  

The market is awaiting a statement accompanying the expected quarter-point rate hike from the Federal Open Market Committee to see how US borrowing costs are likely to increase over the coming few months from their current 46-year low of 1.00 percent.  

In particular, markets will be looking to see if the Fed drops the word "measured" -- to describe its approach to near-term monetary policy -- from the statement.

   LPWASHINGTON, June 29 (AFP) -  

US Federal Reserve policymakers opened a two-day meeting Tuesday to make a potentially risky U-turn by raising interest rates for the first time in four years, analysts say.  
   TDThe Federal Open Market Committee is certain to push up the federal fund target rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, they said.  

A decision will be announced Wednesday at about 2:15 pm (1815 GMT).  

Investors seemed to dislike the prospect.  

A survey by UBS and Gallup showed 52 percent of respondents believed the Federal Reserve should leave rates untouched over the next three months, 34 percent agreed with a rise and 11 percent backed a cut.  

Rates are only rising, however, because of sustained strength of the economy is generating new jobs and feeding inflation fears, analysts said.  

Consumer confidence shot to a two-year high this month, catapulted by a jobs boom and solid economic prospects, a survey by the Conference Board showed Tuesday.  

The consumer confidence index, compiled from a survey of 5,000 households, leapt 8.8 points to 101.9, the economic research group said.  

It was the strongest showing since June 2002.  

"This is good news for economic growth as the more confident people are, especially about their jobs, the more they may be willing to spend," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.  

"For the Fed, this is just another reason to raise the funds rate tomorrow. How far and how fast depends upon inflation."  

Share prices rose moderately.  

The blue chip Dow Jones industrials average gained 56.34 points, or 0.54 percent, to 10,413.43.  

Since January 2001, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has cut rates steeply to offset the popping of the technology bubble in the late 1990s, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  

Greenspan has promised to move at a "measured" pace in returning rates to normal.  

But he also has underscored his determination to move faster if he has to beat back unexpected vigor in inflation.  

Latest data released Monday showed prices paid by consumers, tracked by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, rose 0.5 percent in May, a 15-month high.  

Stripping out food and energy, however, core prices were up 0.2 percent, the Commerce Department said.  

Even if the Federal Reserve statement Wednesday failed to highlight the risk of inflation, "that will not fool anyone," Naroff said.  

If fresh data showed prices moving steadily higher, "the already upward-revised fed funds forecasts will be revised upward again," the economist said.  

Greenspan and his colleagues embark on the interest rate tightening cycle at a delicate time, with President George W. Bush fighting for reelection November 2.  

But the election would not dissuade policymakers from acting, Commerzbank Securities economist Peter Dixon said in a report.  

"The Fed will do what it has to do to fulfil its mandate of securing economic and financial stability, and certainly cannot be seen to be taking decisions for political reasons," he said.  

Iraq would be more important to Bush's election than the economy, Dixon said.  

"The early handover of sovereignty yesterday was certainly viewed as positive by the markets but US troops remain in Iraq and thus in the firing line," he said.  

"In this respect, the parallels are closer to 1968 when the economy was growing strongly but an unpopular war cost the incumbent party the presidency," he said.  

If Greenspan moved too fast, however, he would risk stalling the economy, analysts said.'  

In 1994, when the Federal Reserve pushed the interest rate to six percent from three percent in a year, the shock was blamed for almost melting the mortgage market, sending Orange County, California into bankruptcy and triggering the ensuing Mexican peso crisis.

   LPWASHINGTON, June 29 (AFP) -  

US Federal Reserve policymakers opened a two-day meeting Tuesday to perform an unpopular, potentially dangerous U-turn after three years of interest rate cuts, analysts say.  
   TDThe Federal Open Market Committee is certain to raise the federal fund target rate, which commercial banks charge each other overnight, from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, they said.  

The expected rate rise, which would be the first in four years, will be announced Wednesday at about 2:15 pm (1815 GMT).  

The meeting began as scheduled mid-afternoon Tuesday, a Federal Reserve official said.  

Investors oppose the expected interest rate rise and are already sweating about the speed of future tightening.  

A survey by UBS and Gallup showed 52 percent of respondents believed the Federal Reserve should leave rates untouched over the next three months, 34 percent agreed with a rise and 11 percent backed a cut.  

Nevertheless, consumer confidence shot to a two-year high this month, catapulted by a jobs boom and solid economic prospects, a survey by the Conference Board showed Tuesday.  

The consumer confidence index, compiled from a survey of 5,000 households, leapt 8.8 points to 101.9, the economic research group said.  

It was the strongest showing since June 2002.  

"This is good news for economic growth as the more confident people are, especially about their jobs, the more they may be willing to spend," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.  

"For the Fed, this is just another reason to raise the funds rate tomorrow. How far and how fast depends upon inflation."

   LPWASHINGTON, June 29 (AFP) -   

Most US investors were opposed to an all-but-inevitable US interest rate rise when questioned in a survey released Tuesday by UBS and the Gallup Organization.   
   TDA slim majority -- 52 percent -- of respondents said the US Federal Reserve should leave interest rates untouched over the next three months, 34 percent agreed with a rise and 11 percent backed a cut.   

The survey, conducted June 1-16 with 802 investors aged over 17, found people generally resigned to tighter rates.   

Sixty-six percent of the respondents said they anticipated a rate rise in the next three months, 27 percent expected no change and five percent awaited a cut.   

Despite opposing an economy-cooling rate rise, investors sweated about inflation.   

Sixty percent of those polled said inflation was a serious problem, comprising 42 percent describing it as "somewhat serious" and 18 percent saying it was "very serious".   

A substantial 47 percent of respondents worried inflation would hurt their own investments, including 12 percent who were "very worried" and 35 percent "somewhat worried."   

Sixty one percent of them believed inflation was damaging the investment climate to some extent.   

Survey organizers said they were 95-percent confident that the results were accurate to within plus or minus four percentage points.

Greenspan has promised to move at a "measured" pace in returning rates to normal, but he also has underscored his determination to move faster if he has to beat back unexpected vigor in inflation.  

"It is ... not whether the FOMC will raise the funds rate on Wednesday. It almost certainly will and it will likely be 25 basis points," said Joel Naroff, independent economist and president of Naroff Economic Advisors.  

"The real issue is: Will the committee decide to put inflation at the top of the list?."  

Latest data released Monday showed prices paid by consumers, tracked by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, rose 0.5 percent in May, a 15-month high.  

Stripping out food and energy, however, core prices were up 0.2 percent, the Commerce Department said.  

Inflation was becoming an issue, Naroff said.  

"The Fed chairman will have to go searching for a new index to support his view that inflation will rise only slowly," he said.  

Even if the Federal Reserve statement Wednesday fails to highlight the risk of inflation, "that will not fool anyone," Naroff said.  

"Another price report like this one (in Monday's data) and the already upward-revised fed funds forecasts will be revised upward again."
