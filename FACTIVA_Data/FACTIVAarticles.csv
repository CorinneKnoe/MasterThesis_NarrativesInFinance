2017-12-15 00:00:00,Rockier year expected after Yellen's steady hand,"Analysis. Capital markets Fed officials, economists and traders disagree on the outlook for rates in 2018 Janet Yellen's swansong press conference and penultimate board meeting underscored why investors have largely lamented the end to her stint as Federal Reserve chair. She has been steady, unflappable, and caused nary a ripple across markets despite raising interest rates five times — including three increases in 2017, significantly more than investors expected at the start of the year. Even as the central bank has started its balance sheet shrinkage, something many fund managers had argued could spark severe market disruption, the 10-year Treasury note yieldhas remained stable during Ms Yellen's term. Currently parked around 2.4 per cent, the benchmark lurked near 2.6 per cent when Ms Yellen took up her position in February 2014. Since then the S&P 500 has climbed more than 50 per cent, while the Fed's favoured inflation rate has been steady at about 1.4 per cent. ""She's been really good,"" says Angel Ubide at Goldman Sachs' investment management division. ""She's been very good at communicating, and steering the committee down the middle of the road, and that's good for markets."" The question now is whether this smooth interest rate ""normalisation"" will continue in 2018 under the incoming chairmanship of Jay Powell. Investors were on Wednesday pleasantly surprised that the Fed did not pencil in more than three interest rate increases next year, in line with their previous projections. But the US central bank's projections could look markedly different next year. Neel Kashkari of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Charles Evans of the Chicago Fed both voted against Wednesday's rate increase, and most probably represent the two most dovish ""dots"" on the chart showing Fed policymakers' forecasts of 2018 interest rates. They will next year lose their votes to Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed and John Williams of the San Francisco Fed, who are both more on the hawkish side. Although the ""dots"" did not move higher, the projections for growth and unemployment were noticeably better, and given the momentum the US economy is now enjoying — even setting aside the batch of tax cuts being passed by the Republicans — some analysts reckon that the Fed will raise interest rates four times in 2018. That probably entails further upward pressure on the two-year Treasury note yield, which has risen above 1.80 per cent, its highest level since 2008, from 1.25 per cent since September. The fact that ""financial conditions"", a measure of how supportive markets are of the economy, have eased in spite of the Fed's rate increases indicates that policymakers are likely to move more aggressively next year, argues Matt Freund, co-chief investment officer at Calamos. ""Things are going to become much more restrictive,"" he says, ""much faster than people think."" That is not yet the market's view. The Fed funds futures market indicates that investors only see a 20 per cent chance of even three rises; resolving the disparity could cause turbulence next year, warns Lena Komileva of G+ Economics. ""Unless deflation risk returns, and the economy is nowhere near this danger zone, then the Fed is unlikely to abandon its course of rate hikes,"" she wrote in a note. ""This leaves significant room for a surprise with a potential commensurate impact on market rates and the US dollar as markets re-evaluate the Fed's medium-term normalisation strategy."" Next year is also likely to be an inflection point in global monetary policy. Central banks have swelled their collective balance sheets by $15tn in the past decade, in addition to cutting interest rates down to multi-century lows. That has been a big tailwind for markets that could begin to reverse next year, with the Fed's cautious balance sheet reduction picking up steam and the European Central Bank expected to end its own quantitative easing programme. Some analysts and investors reckon the first signs of looming trouble can be seen in the yield curve. At her press conference Ms Yellen shrugged off the flat yield curve, arguing that it had more to do with higher shortterm interest rates and technical factors such as an eroding ""term premium"" than the real economy. Yet Anne Mathias at Vanguard, says the recent flattening is still disconcerting. ""This is an indicator that will be extremely important to watch for the Fed and markets next year,"" she warns.

2017-12-15 17:16:00,UPDATE 1-Fed's Evans says voted against rate hike over inflation concerns,"(Adds further details, background) WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Friday that he had voted against the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates earlier this week due to worries over tepid inflation. ""I am concerned that persistent factors are holding down inflation, rather than idiosyncratic transitory ones. Namely, the public's inflation expectations appear to me to have drifted down below the (committee's) 2 percent inflation target,"" Evans said in a statement explaining his dissent. The U.S. central bank raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point in a 7-2 decision but left its interest rate outlook for the coming years unchanged. Minneapolis Fed's Neel Kashkari also dissented. The Fed projected that inflation would remain below its target rate for another year. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation has retreated for much of the past year and currently stands at 1.4 percent. Policymakers have been vexed by the shortfall, but given the strength of U.S. economic growth and low unemployment, decided to proceed with gradual increases in its benchmark lending rate. Evans, however, said that leaving interest rates unchanged ""would have better supported a general pickup in inflation expectations and increased the likelihood that inflation will rise to 2 percent."" Given that policymakers have raised interest rates twice in 2017 already, he said a pause would have given policymakers time to test their theory that the slowdown in inflation is transitory. ""Waiting a while longer before raising rates would have given us a chance to see whether or not that was true,"" he said.

2017-12-15 20:34:00,PRECIOUS-Gold heads to first weekly gain in 4 weeks after Fed rate hike,"* Gold up 0.5 percent this week * Dollar, U.S. yields lower after rate hike * Low prices spur Asian demand (Updates comment, prices; adds byline, NEW YORK dateline) By Chris Prentice and Peter Hobson NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Gold prices clung to earlier gains and were poised for their first weekly gain in four weeks on Friday, withstanding pressure from strong equities markets on continued support from this week's interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve. Spot gold        was up 0.19 percent at $1,255.12 per ounce by 2:22 p.m. EST (1922 GMT), up 0.6 percent for the week as it recovered from Monday's five-month low of $1,235.92. The most active U.S. gold         futures for February delivery settled up 0.03 percent, at $1,257.50 per ounce. Higher interest rates usually push gold lower because they raise bond yields, reducing the appeal of non-yielding bullion, and boost the dollar, making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. But markets had priced in Wednesday's rise and the dollar and bond yields fell after the Fed kept its outlook for three rate rises next year unchanged and said proposed U.S. tax cuts would not significantly spur growth. U.S. inflation remained weak, which Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Friday undermined the case for rate rises. The dollar recouped some losses as Republican senators worked to resolve disagreements on the tax reform. Major stock indexes hit record highs. ""The rate hike was baked in, but I think more importantly there was this slight doubt in people's minds that the Fed might be more aggressive in 2018. What we got from them this week tells us that probably isn't the case,"" Bill O’Neill, partner at Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Also helping was a rise in demand in Asia as buyers took advantage of low prices. Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar said gold's bounce would be short-lived because other asset classes including equities, industrial metals and even bitcoin appeared to offer better returns. Gold is up around 9 percent this year while global shares and industrial metals have gained some 20 percent and bitcoin 1,740 percent. In other metals, palladium         was down 1.19 percent at $1,020.72, but still up for the week after hitting $1,038 an ounce on Thursday, the highest since early 2001. ""The palladium metal supply remains tight and until this is alleviated we can expect the premium to remain,"" said Miguel Perez-Santalla, vice president of Heraeus Precious Metals in New York. Silver        was up 1.01 percent at $16.03 per ounce and set for its first weekly gain in four weeks. Platinum        rose 1.28 percent at $889.75 per ounce, marginally higher for the week.

2017-12-15 17:14:00,Fed's Evans Says Concerns About Persistently Weak Inflation Behind His Dissent; Chicago Fed chief says holding rates steady this week would have better supported a pickup in inflation expectations,"Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said concerns about inflation were behind his vote against the central bank's rate increase this week, although he described the decision as a close one. ""I am concerned that persistent factors are holding down inflation, rather than idiosyncratic transitory ones,"" he said, adding that the public's inflation expectations ""appear to me to have drifted down below"" the Fed's 2% target. The central bank's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted 7-2 to increase its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%, the fifth such increase in two years. According to forecasts released after the meeting, officials project inflation will rise to their 2% target only by late 2019. Inflation has undershot the Fed's 2% goal for much of the past five years. Mr. Evans and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari cast the dissenting votes at the meeting. Both have cited weak inflation as a reason to hold off on raising rates. In a statement on his decision to dissent released Friday, Mr. Evans expressed concerns ""that too many observers have the impression that our 2% objective is a ceiling that we do not wish inflation to breach."" He stressed that the 2% figure is a ""symmetric inflation target."" ""That is, we would like to see the odds of inflation running modestly below 2 percent equal the odds of it running modestly above over the long run,"" he said. Holding rates steady at the two-day meeting ended Wednesday ""would have better supported a general pickup in inflation expectations and increased the likelihood that inflation will rise,"" Mr. Evans said. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen after the meeting said she thinks the factors holding down inflation this year are likely to prove transitory. ""But I have tried to be straightforward in saying that this could end up being something that is more engrained and turns out to be permanent. It's very important to watch it and if necessary, rethink what's determining inflation,"" she told reporters. Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com",WSJ Pro Central Banking
2017-12-14 14:57:00,"As Fed Tightens, Europe Hangs Loose; Region's banks in no rush to follow the Fed in raising rates","Central banks in Europe showed continued caution about the region's economic recovery on Thursday, signaling that they are in no rush to follow the Federal Reserve in steadily raising interest rates despite a rare synchronized expansion across the world economy. The European Central Bank left its interest rates unchanged, even as its new economic projections forecast strong growth for the 19-nation eurozone through 2020. ""The incoming information indicates a strong pace of economic expansion and a significant improvement in the growth outlook,"" said Mario Draghi, the ECB's president, in a news conference. The ECB's economists now expect the eurozone's economy will grow by 2.3% in 2018, a big increase from the 1.8% growth projected as recently as September. They continue to expect this year to be the currency area's best since 2007. However, Mr. Draghi said interest rates would ""remain at their present levels for an extended period of time"" and confirmed the ECB's plan to continue buying government bonds and other assets until September 2018, but at the reduced monthly rate of €30 billion ($35.5 billion). In response to that expected announcement, the euro was little changed against the dollar, falling from around $1.184 as Mr. Draghi's news conference began to around $1.181 shortly after, down 0.2% for the day. The reason for his continued caution is that the pickup in growth has yet to significantly change the outlook for inflation. The ECB's economists raised their inflation forecast for next year, but still see it staying below the target of just under 2% in both 2018 and 2019. ""The news on inflation remains somewhat muted,"" Mr. Draghi said. Like the ECB, the central banks of Switzerland and Norway left their key interest rates unchanged, and indicated that a first move to lift them back to levels that were considered normal before the global financial crisis is some way off. Because much of Switzerland's exports are destined for the eurozone, the SNB's monetary policy is heavily dependent on what the ECB does. ""To be very clear, it's too early to talk about normalization in the case of the Swiss National Bank,"" said Thomas Jordan, who heads the institution. But there are signs that some of Europe's central banks are contemplating an earlier start to normalization than previously indicated. Norway's central bank said it now expects a first rate increase in the autumn of 2018, having previously expected to move in 2019. The Bank of England also left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, although it is ahead of most of its European peers, having last month raised borrowing costs in the U.K. for the first time in a decade. That is because it faces a unique challenge. Officials fret the country's planned withdrawal from the European Union in early 2019 is holding back investment, and squeezing the economy's capacity to produce goods and services. The BOE's Monetary Policy Committee said in a statement that it expects to further increase its benchmark rate over the next three years to bring annual inflation, which hit 3.1% in November, back to its 2% target. Future rate rises are expected to be gradual and limited, it said. The decisions by European central banks are likely to underline a persistent policy divergence between the world's major central banks a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis. While the Fed has been gradually nudging up interest rates for the past two years, the ECB isn't expected to start raising rates until late 2019. ""The stage at which the economic recovery is in the U.S. is more advanced, especially so when we look at the wages behavior,"" Mr. Draghi said. That divergence helps to support a European economic recovery that is at an earlier stage than that in the U.S.—not least by holding down European currencies against the dollar and supporting the region's exports. ECB officials are eager to keep their options open amid ongoing economic risks: While the U.S. economy is expected to receive a boost next year from planned corporate-tax cuts, European policy makers are navigating major elections and Britain's possibly messy departure from the European Union. The Fed voted Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates for the third time this year, and signaled it would stay on a similar path next year amid a leadership transition. Hours after the Fed's move, the People's Bank of Chinafollowed suit, increasing the rates it charges in open-market operations and on its medium-term lending facility. On both sides of the Atlantic, policy makers are wrestling with weak inflation, which has yet to rebound strongly despite strengthening economic growth and employment. Recent data suggest the eurozone's economic recovery continues to strengthen and is reassuringly broad. A survey of 5,000 manufacturers and service providers released Thursday suggests the eurozone economy ended the year on a strong note, as eurozone factories had their strongest month since the measure began in 1997. ""The eurozone economy is picking up further momentum as the year comes to a close,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, the data firm that compiles the surveys. Europe's caution raises concerns that lingering central-bank stimulus policies could fuel encourage excessive risk-taking by investors or the misallocation of capital to weak firms. Lena Komileva, chief economist at G+ Economics in London, warns of a ""growing risk that this cycle will end in another financial event unless central banks get ahead of the curve."" In a report published last month, the ECB said it sees the potential for large corrections in global asset prices as investors load up on risky investments even as major central banks dial down their postcrisis stimulus policies.

2017-12-14 11:33:00,"The Fed Isn't the Tax Cut's Enemy; Officials are open to the possibility that the tax cut will raise the economy's potential growth rate, although it isn't their base case","With U.S. unemployment at 4.1% and the economy at full capacity, the conventional wisdom is that this is the wrong time for Republicans to cut taxes by $1.4 trillion over the next decade. The fiscal stimulus will overheat the economy and force the Federal Reserve to slow it down by raising interest rates more aggressively. That conventional wisdom may be wrong. Fed officials, in the projections released yesterday and in Chairwoman Janet Yellen's remarks, suggest they aren't standing in the way of any boost that the tax cut delivers. Indeed, it may not be entirely unwelcome. The reasons are twofold. One is that inflation is still too low, and that completely changes the equation: It suggests overheating is to be welcomed, not resisted. The other is that officials are open to the possibility that the tax cut will raise the economy's potential growth rate, which means faster growth wouldn't necessarily lead to more inflation. That isn't their base case, which may irritate President Donald Trump. But more important for Mr. Trump is that Ms. Yellen and her likely successor, Fed governor Jerome Powell, aren't yet the party poopers many supply-side tax cut advocates feared. ""My fears have not been realized,"" Larry Kudlow, an economist and radio host who has informally advised Mr. Trump, said in an interview Wednesday. The real test, he said, is how the Fed reacts if growth tops 3%, as he expects: ""We have to wait and see."" Start with the projections. Fed officials now expect growth to average 2.3% from 2017 to 2020, up from 2.1% in September, and unemployment to average 4%, down from 4.2%. Yet officials foresee virtually no change in inflation or any need to raise rates faster. This seems at odds with the Fed's view of the world, embodied by the ""Phillips curve,"" which predicts inflation to pick up as unemployment drops further below its long-term rate, estimated by the Fed to be around 4.6%. In her press conference Wednesday, Ms. Yellen explained that officials do expect the tax cut to raise growth and lower unemployment, but ""counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than you expect. It could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective."" Indeed, the Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices, excluding energy and food, rose less than economists expected in November, perpetuating the puzzle of why inflation remains stuck below the Fed's 2% target. At his Senate confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Powell suggested the economy might not be at full employment because so many adult workers have dropped out of the labor force and aren't recorded as unemployed. In such circumstances the Phillips curve dictates that the Fed slow or even halt the pace of interest-rate increases to get unemployment even lower. But fiscal stimulus can accomplish the same thing, and indeed Fed officials in past years routinely implored fiscal policy makers to share the burden of boosting growth. The latest projections suggest there remains some merit to the argument. Though perhaps for not much longer. By 2020 Fed officials expect their benchmark federal-funds rate to reach 3.1%, which would be above the 2.8% they expect to prevail in a fully-employed economy growing normally. This is a sign they think the economy could overheat and need the Fed to press the brakes. When it has tried this in the past, the Fed has often overshot and pushed the economy into recession, precisely the outcome Mr. Kudlow and other supply-siders fear. But three years is a long time, long enough to tell if the tax cut has the supply-side benefits proponents such as Mr. Kudlow claim. If it does, then in an economy with ""disturbingly low productivity growth, that would be welcome and could support faster [gross domestic product] growth, at least for some period, without creating a need to tighten monetary policy to offset that,"" Ms. Yellen said. In other words, it doesn't matter much what the Fed thinks right now about what the tax cut will accomplish; it will let the data answer that question and adjust interest rates accordingly. This outlook isn't an endorsement. Ms. Yellen made it clear she didn't agree with Mr. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the tax cut would pay for itself, and warned it may be ""taking what is already a significant [debt] problem and making it worse."" If she were running fiscal policy, it isn't what she would choose to do. While this isn't what Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to hear, Ms. Yellen's monetary actions matter far more than her fiscal words and on that front, they so far have little to fear.

2017-12-14 21:50:00,"Mexico's Central Bank Raises Rates as Inflation Concerns Mount; Overnight  interest rate  target now stands at 7.25%, the highest since 2009","MEXICO CITY—The Bank of Mexico raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point Thursday after a six-month pause, as policy makers have grown increasingly worried about high inflation. The overnight interest rate target now stands at 7.25%—the highest since February 2009. The policy meeting marked Alejandro Díaz de León's first as the central bank's governor. He took over two weeks ago facing a tough situation, with high inflation, slowing economic growth, and a weak and volatile peso. Some analysts said Mr. Díaz de León may have sought to burnish the bank's orthodox credentials at his first meeting as governor. ""The main challenge for the bank's board…is to reinforce the downward path for inflation to the target,"" the policy statement said. A majority of the bank's four voting members agreed to the move, while one member called for a half-percentage point increase, underscoring the concern inflation is causing for the board. The peso—the second most traded emerging-market currency with daily average turnover of some $112 billion—appreciated 0.3% just after the policy announcement, briefly hitting 18.97 to the U.S. dollar before moving back above 19. The rate decision was increasingly expected by markets and analysts in recent weeks as annual inflation came in above expectations in November at 6.6%, more than double the bank's 3% target. The Bank of Mexico had been expecting inflation to start slowing at the end of the year, but now sees it ending December above the November level. In its policy statement, the central bank said the outlook for inflation has turned ""more complex"" and that it will take longer for prices to return to the target. The bank now sees inflation ""moderately"" above 3% during the next two years. The rate increase is probably the last in the cycle, said Neil Shearing, the chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. ""But it's clear that policy makers won't require much persuading to tighten again, particularly if the peso comes under renewed pressure."" The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate increase this week also left Mexico's central bank little maneuvering room. The bank said the peso has been pressured since the third quarter by expectations of Fed rate increases and uncertainty over the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Canada. Higher borrowing costs mean less money available for consumers, which in turn puts downward pressure on prices. Many observers fear that also will be a drag on an already sluggish Mexican economy that contracted 0.3% during the third quarter after a string of natural disasters hit Mexico. The growth outlook looks gloomy, the bank indicated, as the often contentious Nafta talks have hit investment ""considerably"" and are likely behind the slowdown in private consumption in the second half of the year. Inflation was below the central bank's target until late last year. The uptick this year is mainly explained by the average 20% increase in gasoline prices ordered by the government at the beginning of the year as the country liberalizes energy markets, and peso depreciation that has made imports more expensive. Until early this month, most analysts expected the Bank of Mexico to stand pat on rates in the near term after the central bank called a pause in a tightening cycle that increased the overnight rate to 7% from 3% between December 2015 and June 2017.

2017-12-14 23:30:00,All Regional Fed Banks on Board With Wednesday's Discount-Rate Increase; The Fed's board of governors voted to raise the discount rate a quarter percentage point to 2%,"WASHINGTON—All 12 of the Federal Reserve's regional reserve banks are on board with the central bank's decision to raise its discount rate at Wednesday's policy meeting. The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted to raise its benchmark federal-funds rate a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%. The Fed's board of governors also voted to raise the primary credit rate, known as the discount rate, a quarter percentage point to 2%. The discount rate is the interest rate on short-term loans offered to healthy banks through the Fed's discount window. On Thursday, the board approved requests from the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, St. Louis and Minneapolis to increase the rate to 2%, effective immediately, the Fed said in a statement.

2017-12-14 18:03:00,"Transcript: Janet Yellen's December Postmeeting Press Conference; Fed chief discusses GOP plans to cut taxes, the outlook for the economy and inflation, and how she feels about leaving the central bank","Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen addressed the media Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2017, in Washington after the central bank voted to raise short-term interest rates for the third time this year. In her final scheduled press conference as Fed chief, she discussed Republican lawmakers' plans to cut taxes, the outlook for the economy and inflation, and how she feels about leaving the central bank early next year. Here is a transcript of her exchange with reporters, lightly edited for length and clarity. JANET YELLEN: Good afternoon. Today, the [Fed's interest-rate-setting] Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal-funds rate by one-quarter percentage point, bringing it to 1¼ to 1½ percent. Our decision reflects our assessment that a gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market, while fostering a return of inflation to 2 percent, consistent with the maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law. Before saying more about our decision, I'll review recent economic developments in the outlook. Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth stepped up to a solid 3¼ percent pace in the second and third quarters of the year. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate. Business investment has picked up. And favorable economic conditions abroad have supported exports. Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace. While changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain. Smoothing through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains averaged 170,000 per month over the three months ending in November, well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate has declined further in recent months, and at 4.1 percent in November was modestly below the median of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. Broader measures of labor-market utilization have also continued to strengthen. Participation in the labor force has changed little on net over the past four years. Given the underlying downward trend in participation, stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improved conditions in the labor market. We expect that the job market will remain strong in the years ahead. You may have noticed that we altered the statement language about the labor-market outlook. This change highlights that the committee expects the labor market to remain strong, with sustained job creation, ample opportunities for workers, and rising wages. We anticipate some further strengthening in labor-market conditions in the months ahead. However, we expect the pace of job gains to moderate over time as we gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation. Allowing the labor market to overheat would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly at a later stage, jeopardizing the economic expansion. Even with the firming of economic growth and a stronger labor market, inflation has continued to run below the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run objective. The 12-month change in the price index for personal-consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent in October, up a bit from the summer but still below rates seen earlier in the year. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has followed a similar pattern, and was 1.4 percent in October. We continue to believe that this year's surprising softness in inflation primarily reflects transitory developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions. As a result, we still expect inflation will move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, as I've noted previously, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperfect. As emphasized in our statement, we will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to our symmetric inflation goal. And as I've noted before, we're prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve our inflation and employment objectives over the medium term. Let me turn to the economic projections that committee participants submitted for this meeting. As always, participants condition their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which in turn depend on each participant's assessment of the many factors that shape the outlook. The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2½ percent this year and next, and moderates to 2 percent by 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate. The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, and runs close to 4 percent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate. Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Compared with the projections made in September, real GDP growth is a little stronger. The unemployment rate is a bit lower, and inflation is essentially unchanged. Participants generally identified changes in tax policy as a factor supporting this modestly stronger outlook, although many noted that much uncertainty remains about the macroeconomic effects of the specific measures that ultimately may be implemented. Returning to monetary policy, for the past two years the FOMC has been gradually increasing its target range for the federal-funds rate as the economy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. Our decision today continues this process. We still expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal-funds rate. That expectation is based on our view that this rate remains somewhat below its neutral level; that is, the level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel. Because the neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, the federal-funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral policy stance. But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal-funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain a strong labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective. Even so, the committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal-funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades. This view is consistent with participants' projections of appropriate monetary policy. The median projection for the federal-funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of next year, 2.7 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.1 percent in 2020. Compared with the projections made in September, the median path for the federal-funds rate is unchanged through 2019, and a touch higher in 2020. I should note that the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal-funds rate as their economic outlooks and views of the risks to the outlook change. Policy is not on a preset course. Additionally, the committee's balance-sheet normalization program, initiated in October, is proceeding. As we've noted previously, changing the target range for the federal-funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and we do not foresee a need to alter our balance-sheet normalization program. Hence our statement no longer mentions this program. Of course, we would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal-funds rate. Finally, I'd like to note that although I have one more FOMC meeting to attend in the new year, this will be my last scheduled news conference. Over the next month and a half, I will do my utmost to ensure a smooth transition to my designated successor, [current Fed governor] Jay Powell. I'm confident that he is as deeply committed as I have been to the Federal Reserve's vital public mission. Thank you for being such an attentive audience these past four years. And, as always, I'll be happy to take your questions. Q: I'm Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. Madam Chair, could you give us any insight into the discussion and how it dealt with the major tax changes that Congress is considering now? There have been thoughts that, with these changes happening at a time when the economy is already – with unemployment so low that the Fed may be forced to increase its pace on rate hikes. Did any of that discussion come up in your meeting? MS. YELLEN: So, yes, we did discuss tax policy. And let me say that most of my colleagues factored in the prospect of fiscal stimulus along the lines of what's being contemplated by Congress into their projections. Now, I should emphasize that some have been incorporating those expectations into their projections throughout the year. So changes to the projections that you see since September should not be viewed as an impact – an estimate of the impact of the tax package. And in particular, broader expectations of changes to fiscal policy have been reflected in financial-market conditions, I think, over the past year. For example, we have seen significant increase in the stock market. And at least some portion of that I would judge likely partly reflected expected tax changes. And that effect, along with other financial-market effects, which affects, for example, projected consumer spending and would have affected wealth, that's been part of participants' forecasts now for some time. I think my colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely to be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years. And you see that. In part that's one of the reasons, I think, for the uptick you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rate. The views of participants, I believe, have been informed by a wide range of analysis, including that of the [congressional] Joint Committee on Taxation and other outside evaluators. And my sense is that their estimates are essentially in this same ballpark, although they recognize, as I emphasized, that there is considerable uncertainty about the impacts and that will have to be monitored over time. More specifically, they tend to see the packages boosting both consumer spending and capital spending to some extent. Now, to the extent that the changes do have positive impact on the growth of potential GDP and longer-run growth, let me just say that this is something that, should it occur, would be very welcome to participants as long as it's consistent with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives. I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections and changes in tax policy. That's only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth in inflation. All of that factors into the projections you see. But I think, bottom line, when you look at assessments of the funds rate path, participants continue to see gradual increases in the target rate for the federal-funds rate as being appropriate to sustain a strong labor market and bring inflation back to 2 percent. And, look, importantly there is a lot of uncertainty about what the likely effects will be. And my colleagues and I will be committed, as always, to evaluating incoming data and altering the outlook as appropriate. Q: Harriet Torry with Dow Jones Newswires. You and others at the Fed have said that soft inflation should be transitory. Are you confident that that will still be the case, particularly regarding wage gains? They've been pretty moderate in recent months, yet the economy is growing and confidence is high. Is there something going on in the economy that's making it difficult for businesses to raise wages? MS. YELLEN: So it is true that incoming wage data suggests only modest upward pressure on wages. That leads me – that's one factor, along with the fact that inflation remains low, with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, that the labor market is not overheated at this point. Remember the modest pace of wage gains also probably reflects slow productivity growth. But when you ask me about the outlook for inflation, you know, I've talked in detail about this in the past, and recognized that there is uncertainty about what's holding inflation down. But my colleagues and I continue to believe that the factors that are responsible this year for holding inflation down are likely to prove transitory. That said, we all agree that our inflation objective is extremely important. We recognize that there's been a prolonged shortfall. This is a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. And we continue to indicate that we'll be monitoring inflation developments closely. And so this is on the horizon and recognized to be one of the risks facing policy. Q: Thank you. Nick Timiraos of The Wall Street Journal. Chair Yellen, I wanted to follow up on the question about tax changes. When you addressed it earlier today, and when you spoke to Congress last month, you often described that you would welcome higher growth in the context of the employment and inflation mandate. And I guess I wonder how you judge the major provisions of the House and Senate tax plans – a corporate rate cut, immediate expensing of big-ticket purchases, new rates for passthroughs, temporary rate cuts for individuals. Do you see those, on balance, boosting the productive capacity of the U.S. economy, as opposed to simply increasingly aggregate demand? And related to that, how would you view the benefit of such tax changes now, when the economy is nearing full employment, versus at earlier periods when there was greater resource slack? MS. YELLEN: So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the likely tax package as boosting aggregate demand, but also having some potential to boost aggregate supply. So changes on the corporate tax side, the reduction in the corporate tax rate, expensing will lower the cost of capital. And while there are a range of estimates and uncertainty about how much stimulus that will provide to investment, in general I would see some stimulus to investment. In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of investment could boost capital formation and thereby raise productivity growth, and potential GDP or output, to some extent. Exactly how large those effects might be remain uncertain. But that is a channel. And I suppose it's also possible – I'm uncertain how significant this would be – that lower marginal effect of tax rates for those groups that will see them could boost labor supply. And again, there are a range of estimates in the literature. As I indicated, I think participants who have reviewed a number of pieces of analysis, including the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates and the many outside analysts who have weighed in on this, have been influenced by that kind of analysis. But there is a good deal of uncertainty about what the impacts would be. And to the extent that there are larger impacts than those analyses assume on aggregate supply or potential GDP, in the context of an economy that has had disturbingly low productivity growth, that would be welcome and could support faster GDP growth, at least for some period, without – you know, without creating a need to tighten monetary policy to offset that. So there are potentially both demand and supply effects here. So, importantly, you really don't, at the end of the day, see very much change in the federal-funds rate path. Participants do recognize that the unemployment rate is lower than their estimates of its long-run sustainable rate. So I think we are in the vicinity of full employment. Q: Heather Long from the Washington Post. You've mentioned that the committee thinks there will be wage increases next year. I'm wondering if you could clarify if that is coming in part or mostly from the changes to the tax plan. Is that – is that what the expectation is would drive the wage increases? And I was also wondering – I've heard from so many female economists in academia and at the Fed about what an inspiration you've been to them and how melancholy they will be to see you go. I was wondering if you just had any final words to young females and minorities who may be looking to enter economics or banking profession and rise to your level. MS. YELLEN: I'm sorry, remind me of the first part of your question. (Laughter.) At least if – Q: Wages. MS. YELLEN: About wages, yeah. Q: Is the tax policy driving wage increase expectation. MS. YELLEN: Well, I think generally in a strong labor market where many firms are having difficult finding qualified workers, we would expect just through normal demand and supply channels to see some upward pressure on wage growth over time. And as the labor market has tightened, we've seen some very gradual drift upward in wage gains. They remain – it remains at a low level. But would expect, in the context of an ongoing strong labor market, to see some upward pressure, and I believe that's the main thing that my colleagues are factoring in. On your question on advice to women and minorities, in the Federal Reserve my colleagues and I are very focused on wanting to see and do what we can to foster greater participation of women and minorities in economics. We would love to, if we could, increase our hiring ourselves of women and minorities. And we see that both women and minorities are studying economics in disproportionately and disturbingly low numbers. Although the women in STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] fields generally are about even with men, represent about 50 percent, in economics women majors constitute something like 30 percent of undergraduate majors, and there is disproportionate low enrollment of minorities. I will just say from my own experience I think economics is a terrific field. I've thoroughly enjoyed my career in economics, and think there are many different paths that people can follow that lead to satisfying careers, and that there are very interesting and important questions that economics addresses. And it is a great field, and would like to encourage greater involvement, and think that people will find that satisfying. And just in terms of the kinds of research that's done in the field, I think also a greater diversity – more women and minorities – may change the focus, to some extent, of the questions that people choose to look at and the analysis that they bring and range of thinking that bears on research. And all of that would be a healthy development. Q: Steve Liesman, CNBC. Every day it seems we look at the stock market; it goes up triple digits in the Dow Jones. To what extent are there concerns at the Federal Reserve about current market valuations? And do they now or should they, do you think, if we keep on going on this trajectory, should that animate monetary policy? Finally, maybe as a sign of what's been going on with valuations, this cryptocurrency called bitcoin keeps going up every day. What is the policy of the central bank of the United States of the introduction, use and incredible rise in popularity of bitcoin? MS. YELLEN: OK, so let me start, Steve, with the stock market generally. I mean, of course, the stock market has gone up a great deal this year. And we have, in recent months, characterized the general level of asset valuations as elevated. What that reflects is simply the assessment that looking at price-earnings ratios, and comparable metrics for other assets other than equities, we see ratios that are in the high end of historical ranges. And so that's worth pointing out. But economists are not great at knowing what appropriate valuations are. We don't have a terrific record. And the fact that those valuations are high doesn't mean that they're necessarily overvalued. We are in a – I've mentioned this in my opening statement and we've talked about this repeatedly, like a low-interest-rate environment, lower than we've had in past decades. And if that turns out to be the case, that's a factor that supports higher valuations. We're enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation. And the risks in the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years. So I think what we need to and are trying to think through is if there were an adjustment in asset valuations with the stock market, what impact would that have on the economy, and would it provoke financial-stability concerns? And I think when we look at other indicators of financial-stability risks, there's nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange. We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we're not seeing some worrisome building in leverage or credit growth at successive levels. So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to. But if you ask me, is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, well, it's on the list of risks. It's not a major – it's not a major factor. And then you asked about bitcoin. And there I would simply say that bitcoin at this time plays a very small role in the payment system. It is not a stable source of – store of value. And it doesn't constitute legal tender. It is a highly speculative asset. And the Fed doesn't really play any role, any regulatory role, with respect to bitcoin other than assuring that banking organizations that we do supervise are attentive that they're appropriately managing any interactions they have with participants in that market and appropriately monitoring anti-money-laundering Bank Secrecy Act, you know, responsibilities that they have. Q: Has there been a directive – pardon me. Has there been a directive about bitcoin to the banks and their dealings with bitcoin from the Federal Reserve? MS. YELLEN: I don't believe there's been anything specific about that. Just generally, banks have Bank Secrecy Act anti-money-laundering responsibilities. And this applies to bitcoin and it does every other realm. Q: Donna – hi, Chair Yellen. Donna Borak with CNN. To return back to the prospective tax-bill questions, in your view at all, is the Republican tax bill an ill-timed fiscal stimulus? And are you concerned at all it will wind up squandering the tools that both the Congress and the Fed have when it comes time to dealing with a recession? MS. YELLEN: So, look, it's – I will just say that it is up to the administration and Congress to decide on appropriate fiscal policy. And our job is to maintain our focus on employment and inflation. We continue to think, as you can see from the projections, that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate, even with most – almost all participants now factoring their assessment of the impact of the tax – the tax policy. You know, it is projected that the tax-cut package will lead to additions to the national debt and boost, by the end of the horizon, the debt-to-GDP ratio. And I will say – and this is nothing new; this is something I've been saying for a long time – I am personally concerned about the U.S. debt situation. It's not that the debt-to-GDP ratio in the – at the moment is extraordinarily or worrisomely high. But it's also not very low. And it's projected, as the population continues to age and the baby boomers retire, that that ratio will continue to rise in an unsustainable fashion. So the addition to the debt, taking what is already a significant problem and making it worse, is – it is of concern to me. And I think it does suggest that in some future downturn, which could occur just for whatever reason, the amount of fiscal space that would exist for fiscal policy to play an active role, it will be limited – may well be limited. Q: Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. A couple of longer-term questions. First of all, midway through the year you talked about the issue of whether inflation targets might need to be raised. There's obviously been a lot more debate in the Fed system since then about this. It may not be an imminent issue, but do you expect it to be something the Fed should be discussing over the coming years, some sort of change to the inflation target? Second of all, the amount of stimulus tools that the Fed may have at its disposal when the next downturn strikes are fairly limited. One of the incoming governors, Marvin Goodfriend, has talked about the merits of negative interest rates. I just wondered whether you see that as a potential, at least in theory, for the Fed to consider, should it run out of other options. Thanks. MS. YELLEN: So right now the FOMC is not discussing or considering its inflation target. We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over the next couple of years. And I would say – you said our stimulus tools are limited. I would want to empathize that if there were a negative shock to the economy we do have some scope to cut the fed-funds rate, and there are other tools available, ones that we have used previously – forward guidance and asset purchases. So I think we're not out – I wouldn't say that we're out of ammunition. But certainly, it's been recognized, and I'm emphasized myself, that in the longer run we may be – and we'll have to see how this works out – but we may be in low interest rate environments where it could prove useful to have additional scope to conduct monetary policy. And in that context, I think additional research – the academic economists and others are thinking hard about what more could be done. And I think these are matters that are certainly worthy of further study. Q: So you do believe that negative interest rates, at least in theory, are possible in the U.S. at some point, if it should be necessary? At least in theory. MS. YELLEN: So, I mean, on that I would say we have – that's not something that we have studied inside the Fed to any considerable extent, and haven't seriously thought about using ourselves during this last downturn and recovery. We have watched what's happened in other countries. I think that's worthwhile. And I would say it's a – it's an area that academics may have interest in in the future, and is worthy of some study. But it hasn't been part of the Fed's agenda. Q: Hi, Chair Yellen. MS. YELLEN: Yes. Q: Victoria Guida with Politico. I just want to ask you quickly on the regulatory side, in your testimony to Congress recently you spoke positively about the Senate bank regulatory reform bill, and I was wondering if there are – beyond that bill if there are tweaks to [the] Dodd-Frank [financial-overhaul law] that you think might still be beneficial. And then, somewhat related, governor Powell recently said that there are currently no U.S. banks that are too big to fail, and I was wondering do you agree with that assessment. MS. YELLEN: Well, I mean, you know, I think the – I'm not familiar with every detail of the bill, but I think the bill does address a wide range of issues that, you know, we have highlighted in the past as being ones where perhaps additional flexibility to tailor our supervisory requirements would be worthwhile. So I don't have additional things on the congressional list – sorry, and what – the other thing – Q: Too big to fail – MS. YELLEN: Oh, too big to fail – Q: Are there any banks that are too big to fail right now? MS. YELLEN: So, you know, we continue to work seriously on resolution and the resolution plans, the living wills, and the structure of systemic firms to ensure that it would be possible to resolve a firm – under the bankruptcy code would be the top choice of methods or, alternatively, under the Orderly Liquidation Authority. And I think it's fair to say that over time we have learned more ourselves and more clearly detailed our expectations for the firms that file living wills, and the firms themselves have made considerable progress in, you know, changing what they do, whether its adopting financial contracts that would facilitate a resolution rather than a disorderly unwinding of contracts, making sure that they're appropriately dealing with shared services so that key services would be able to continue, governance arrangements, legal entity structures – the firms have all made progress in adapting to our expectations of what would enable a successful resolution. So I think it's an ongoing process, and I believe we have made substantial progress. Q: Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. I'm struggling to reconcile the pieces of the economic outlook that you've described today. You've said that we are basically at full employment. You've said that you are expecting a tax package to deliver a significant stimulus and that it will be on the demand side. You expect growth to be faster, you expect unemployment to be lower, and yet somehow inflation is going to remain at 2 percent for the foreseeable future. Could you describe what has changed about your economic assessment so that everything has changed except inflation? MS. YELLEN: Well, you know, the projections that we're showing you today – many factors went into that, fiscal policy being one of a number of different factors. And, you know, you are looking at 16 participants who have made adjustments to their economic outlook for a whole variety of reasons, including in some cases rethinking some of the fundamentals that went into their original forecasts. So there have been modifications in different directions by different participants. So it's – I would caution you about the dangers of looking at the median and acting like that is one individual who has made a change to their forecast. That's a leap that isn't quite justified. But, look, generally you see modestly faster growth over the next couple of years, which is consistent, and I said, I think, for most participants reflects partly an impact from taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending. But it's not a gigantic increase in growth that – since – relative to September. You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inflation has also been running low on a persistent basis. And the committee does have a concern about inflation, and wants to see it moving up. And, on balance, you see only modest changes, slight revisions to the path for the fed-funds rate. You might think, well, shouldn't I see more? Well, OK, growth's a little stronger. The unemployment rate runs a little bit lower. That would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter monetary policy. But again, counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect. And, you know, it could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective. Q: Justine Underhill, Yahoo Finance. So William Dudley of the New York Fed recently said that the Fed is exploring the idea of potentially having its own cryptocurrency, or digital currency. What use do you see a cryptocurrency could have for the Fed? And do you see the potential of a cryptocurrency that might be considered legal tender? MS. YELLEN: So I want to distinguish carefully between digital currency and cryptocurrency. This is – there is a discussion going on among central bankers about the potential merits of adopting – a central bank itself adopting a digital currency, and there might even be a central bank or two around the globe that might go in that direction. But I really want to caution that this is not something the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at this stage. While we're looking at research on this topic, there are, I think, to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a limited need for it, and some substantial concerns. And so I would really doubt that the Federal Reserve would soon go in that direction, but it is something that central banks are looking at to see if there could be benefits from doing it. Q: Chair Yellen, before I ask this question, thanks for your stewardship of the economy – MS. YELLEN: Thank you. Q: – the benefits of which I've seen in some of the harder-hit parts of my own family, so. MS. YELLEN: Thank you. Q: Your tenure, we've seen six Federal Reserve presidents appointed. One was a woman and five are men. So I'd like to know how that comports with your commitment to gender diversity. And, second, I wonder if you think this process of appointing reserve bank presidents needs to be more transparent and accountable. Recently, the Richmond Fed board took 11 months and they came up with a candidate who was another Fed board member. And so I'm wondering what you would say to critics who say that looks like cronyism, and if you think, you know, this could be simply a more open process. These are votes on national monetary policy, after all. MS. YELLEN: So I would agree with you that these are important appointments. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the nonbanking directors of the reserve banks have responsibility for conducting a search, and the board of governors has to sign off on candidates. We've made very clear, and we monitor ongoing searches very carefully to make sure that absolutely every effort is made to create a pool that is diverse, and that there be a national search, and that every attempt should be made to create a diverse pool. At the end of the day, we cannot guarantee that the outcomes of these searches will result in an increase in diversity. I mean, I've been very pleased to see that there's been some success in that regard. But we have signed off on the individuals who were appointed, and have held the view that these are individuals who were qualified to serve in these positions. So I would hope – I would hope to see greater diversity. It has been a challenge to achieve that. Q: Should the process be more open somehow? MS. YELLEN: Well, I think the process has become more open. And a number of the recent searches, there has been outreach, public outreach, information on websites, acceptance of potential names and nominees. And those have gotten careful consideration. There's been – there have been meetings in some cases with community groups to try to enlarge the pool and get suggestions. And I think that's appropriate. And I think it has moved in the direction you're suggesting. Q: Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. I'm wondering if you have any advice for incoming Chair Powell. MS. YELLEN: Well, my colleague – I've had the pleasure of working with him now for many years. And he's somebody who understands the Federal Reserve very well and shares its values. And as I mentioned in my opening statement, he is committed to the mission of the Fed, to its independence and to its acting in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. He is somebody who has participated in the FOMC now for many years. To the best of my knowledge, he's been part of the consensus. I don't believe he's ever dissented. I think there is strong consensus in the committee for the gradual approach that we've been pursuing. And governor Powell has been part of that consensus. So I feel he's very well positioned and very knowledgeable of all the ins and outs of everything that the Fed does in supervision, in the payment system. He's played an active role there and in monetary policy. And I have confidence that he is very capable of steering the Federal Reserve in the years ahead. Q: ... This is John Heltman with American Banker. Sort of a related question to what Nancy was asking. There have been some reservations among some Democratic senators recently during governor Powell's confirmation hearing and during the markup of the reg-relief bill about the approach towards regulation that the new leadership appears to be adopting. Do you have any similar reservations about the new leadership's ability to deregulate in an evenhanded way that keeps an eye towards the stability of the financial system and the sort of – the advances that have come from postcrisis regulation? MS. YELLEN: So I would say that all of my colleagues on the board have expressed a strong commitment to keep in place the core reforms that have produced a stronger financial system. And I'm considering there stronger capital, particularly for the most systemic institutions, higher-quality capital, stronger liquidity requirements, a rigorous stress-testing program, and resolution planning that will make it more possible to resolve the – a firm that encounters significant distress. So I have heard broad-based commitment to those things. And I think they are the core of the reforms we have put in place. I think all of us agree that it is appropriate to tailor our regulatory requirements in all of those areas and others to the systemic footprint of firms. We've done a lot to do that, and I think there's more that could be done. And in some areas it would require legislation in order to do that. But I believe all of my colleagues and I are in agreement on that. And we're also focused on community banks and want to find ways to relieve burdens. So in those important ways, I do think that all of my colleagues are in the same place with respect to their priorities. Q: Are there any important differences between your colleagues' and your vision on regulatory reform? MS. YELLEN: So I have not seen anything emerge at this point that I would describe as a significant difference. Q: Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So, you mentioned, in response to Steve's question, that asset valuations you didn't think were on the sort of high-priority risk list right now. So I'm wondering, what do you think is on that risk list. And more broadly, what have you left undone? You've gotten high marks for bringing the economy back towards its goals, but are there things that are going to nag you when you walk out of here in February and say, really, I wish I'd seen this to completion? I mean, we're not doing negative interest rates. We're not doing inflation framework. What's at your top of – what's at the top of the to-do list that you are not getting to see to bring to ground here? MS. YELLEN: So you asked about the risk list. There are always risks that affect the outlook. We tend to focus in our own evaluation to economic risks. And we've characterized them as balanced. And I think they are balanced. You know, I can always give you a list of, you know, potential troubles, international developments that could result in downside economic risk. But, look, at the moment the U.S. economy is performing well. The growth that we're seeing, it's not based on, for example, an unsustainable buildup of debt, as we had in the runup to the financial crisis. The global economy is doing well. We're in a synchronized expansion. This is the first time in many years that we've seen this. Inflation around the world is generally low. So I think the risks are balanced there's less to lose sleep about now than has been true for quite some time. So I feel good about the economic outlook. I feel, you know, good that the labor market is in a very much stronger place than it was eight years ago. We have created 17 million jobs. We have got a good, strong labor market, and a very low unemployment rate. And I think that's been tremendously important to the well-being of American households and workers. And I feel very pleased when I hear anecdotes from firms that tell me they're having a hard time finding workers. And they talk about, given that they're taking on people with skills that don't quite match what they want, but they're training them and, you know, giving them the training that they need in order to be able to fill jobs. I think that's a development that is a natural one that occurs in a strong labor market that tends to build human capital and worker skills, and that that's a strong positive. As I mentioned, I think the financial system is on much sounder footing, and that we have done a great deal to put in place greater capital liquidity and so forth, that make it less crisis prone, and that it has been an important objective. What's on my undone list, you ask? We have a 2 percent symmetric inflation objective. And for a number of years now, inflation has been running under 2 percent. And I consider it an important priority to make sure that inflation doesn't chronically undershoot our 2 percent objective. And I want to see it move up to 2 percent. So most of my colleagues and I do believe that it's being held down by transitory factors, but there's work undone there in the sense we need to see it move up in line with our objective. Q: Thank you, Chair Yellen. What do you think will be the drivers of inflation over the next couple of years? And how long will the committee go with low unemployment, low inflation, before you rethink monetary policy, this gradual rate hikes? Thank you. MS. YELLEN: So, you know, I think for a number of years – we've had an undershoot of inflation for a number of years. We absolutely recognize that. I think, until this year, undershoot was understandable. First we had a good deal of slack in the labor market. Then we had plummeting oil prices. And, beginning in mid-2014, there was a marked appreciation in the dollar. And those three factors held down inflation for a number of years. Now, in 2016, core inflation came very close to 2 percent. We seem to be on a path of inflation moving up. And this year, beginning in March, there seemed to be a sequence of negative surprises. Some reflect one-time factors that were easily identifiable, like a marked decline in quality-adjusted cellphone plans. There may be other factors that are not so easy to name. But we would judge, no, inflation doesn't always follow exactly. There are errors and many factors that affect it beyond the key influences of labor-market slack, exchange rates and import prices, and oil prices. Those are three big ones, but there are other factors that affect inflation, too. And our judgment at this point is that transitory factors that are unrelated to the broader macroeconomic outlook are holding inflation down. But I have tried to be straightforward in saying that this could end up being something that is more engrained and turns out to be permanent. It's very important to watch it and, if necessary, rethink. What's determining inflation? A possibility is that the longer-run sustainable rate of unemployment is – it's been coming down. Estimates in the committee have come down. It's conceivable that they need to come down even more. It's not my judgment that inflation expectations have slipped, but that also remains a possibility that needs to be monitored. So there are – you know, there could be a rethink of inflation. I think it's important to watch inflation outcomes carefully. And if we don't see inflation moving in the manner that the committee anticipates to alter policies so that we do achieve our 2 percent objective, but at the moment most of my colleagues and I believe we are on track to achieve it. Q: Hi, Chair Yellen. Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times. I'm wondering – you mentioned this is your last news conference. What are your plans when you step down from the Fed? Are you going to remain in Washington? Will you go back to Berkeley? And also, I'm curious if you have any disappointment that you're not going to be continuing in this job, as some of your predecessors have done? MS. YELLEN: So on my plans, I don't have anything definite for you. I guess I have a home in Berkeley and expect to maintain it, but I would say my spouse is on the faculty. He's a professor at Georgetown and would like to stay in his job. And we expect to maintain Washington as our base. But I don't have any definite plans. Let's see. And you asked me if I'm disappointed. So, let me just say that I have served in senior positions in the Federal Reserve now for quite a long time. I became president in San Francisco in 2004. And I have participated in the FOMC since that time, as president, as vice chair, and as chair. And it's been an immensely rewarding experience for me. I feel very positive about what we've been able to accomplish, and feel tremendous, you know, loyalty to the institution. So I did make the judgment that this is the right time for me to leave, but I feel I have served in senior positions at the Fed for a long time. And it's really been an honor and a privilege for me to have had a chance to do so. Q: Adam Shapiro with Fox Business. Glad to hear you're staying on the East Coast. I was just curious. I wanted to follow up to the bitcoin questions, but – because you've lived through what we all experienced in 2007-2008. And should the Fed take a more active role in trying to identify who some of the counterparty and what the exposure is with bitcoin as a potential threat to financial stability? Just the best minds at the Fed can sometimes miss these kinds of threats. Your predecessor, Mr. [Ben] Bernanke, actually said in '07 that the contagion from subprime would not affect the housing market or the economy. So are we underestimating the potential threat from bitcoin as it runs up in value? MS. YELLEN: Well, I certainly agree that it's important for the Fed to attempt to understand emerging risks to financial stability and to be looking not just in the banking system but outside it for developments that could pose financial risks. And we are doing that. And I would say one of the changes during my tenure is we devoted – decided, in the aftermath of the crisis, that we needed to devote considerable resources to financial stability, to monitor for emerging threats. And now we have at the board a full-blown division of financial stability that's involved in doing that. Now, when you ask about bitcoin, I still see the financial-stability risks from it as limited. Often risks threatening financial stability arise when there's exposure of the banking system to fluctuating asset valuations. And I really don't see any significant exposure of our core financial institutions to threats from bitcoin if its value were to fluctuate. I don't see a threat to our core financial institutions. So undoubtedly there are individuals who could lose a lot of money if bitcoin were to fall in price. But I really don't see that as creating a full-blown financial-stability risk. Q: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I suppose I should be asking you a valedictory question since it's the last question, but I don't think you can top what you've already said. So let me just do a couple of cleanup questions here. President [Donald] Trump, while you were speaking, just said that he thinks his tax plan will produce 4 percent growth. Do you think that is possible? Second, do you think that there is any Fed blame or complicity in the flattening of the yield curve? And are you worried that there might be some sort of policy mistake built into that that could slow the economy? And the last question, which is a bit of a valedictory, is one that everybody on Wall Street has wanted to ask you on four years. Since this is your last press conference, can you tell us which dot is yours? (Laughter.) MS. YELLEN: Well, I can answer the last question first. The answer is no. I've never been willing to reveal which dot is mine, and I'm not – I'm not going to change that now. So, you know, my assessment, and I think most participants' assessments, as I said, of the impact of the tax policy on growth has been informed by work by the Joint Committee on Taxation and other analysts. And everyone recognizes that there's uncertainty about what the economic effects would be, and I wouldn't want to rule anything out. It is challenging, however, to achieve growth of the levels that you mentioned. Look, if the package were to stimulate growth of that magnitude, let me just say again, the Federal Reserve would welcome that. If it's a supply – favorable supply-side developments that would be compatible with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives, that's something that would be very welcome. But it would be challenging to achieve numbers like that. Let's see. I think you also then asked me about the yield curve and – I mean, there is much discussion about yield-curve inversions and whether or not a flattening yield curve could signal a recession. Is that the brunt of your question? Q: And whether the Fed has made it – if there's a policy mistake embedded in that. MS. YELLEN: So this is something that we discussed and have looked at. The yield curve has flattened some as we have raised short rates. It mainly – the flattening yield curve mainly reflects higher short-term rates. The yield curve is not currently inverted, and I would say that the current slope is well within its historical range. Now there is a strong correlation historically between yield curve inversions and recessions, but let me emphasize that correlation is not causation, and I think that there are good reasons to think that the relationship between the slope of the yield curve and the business cycle may have changed. And one reason for that is that long-term interest rates generally embody two factors: one is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second piece of it is a so-called term premium that often reflects things like inflation, inflation risk. Typically, the term premium historically has been positive, so when the yield curve has inverted historically, it meant that short-term rates were well above average expected short rates over the longer run. So, with a positive term premium, that's what it means. And, typically, that means that monetary policy is restrictive – sometimes quite restrictive, and some of those recessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tightening monetary policy because inflation was high and trying to slow the economy. Well, right now, the term premium is estimated to be quite low, close to zero, and that means that structurally – and this can be true going forward – that the yield curve is likely to be flatter than it has been in the past. And so it will – could more easily invert. If the Fed were to even move to a slightly restrictive policy stance, you could see an inversion with a zero-term premium. So I think the fact the term premium is so low and the yield curve is generally flatter is an important factor to consider. Now I think it's also important to realize that market participants are not expressing heightened concern about the decline of the term premium and, when asked directly about the odds of recession, they see it as low, and I would concur with that judgment.",WSJ Pro Central Banking
2017-12-14 07:40:00,China’s Central Bank Raises Market Rates Hours After Fed Move,"BEIJING—China’s central bank followed a U.S. interest-rate increase with one of its own to blunt the effect of the Federal Reserve move on the Chinese economy, which cooled further in November. The People’s Bank of China on Thursday raised two key short-term interest rates, hours after the U.S. Fed’s third interest-rate increase this year. Economists say they expect the world’s second-largest economy to feel more pains of soaring funding costs in 2018. Fed officials have penciled in three quarter-point rate increases for the year and two such increases each in 2019 and 2020. The Chinese central bank raised the rates it charges commercial banks on seven-day and 28-day loans by 0.05 percentage point each. It also raised rates for a medium-term liquidity instrument. The increases were smaller than 0.10 percentage-point moves in the first quarter, and the bank left the benchmark policy rates unchanged. The moves indicate that China’s policy makers are trying to strike a balance between easing pressure on the yuan and reducing capital flight on one hand, and managing higher borrowing costs on the other. The PBOC also injected 288 billion yuan ($43.52 billion) of liquidity into the banking system on Thursday to offset the effects of the rate increases. “The rate increases by the PBOC risk exerting more pressure on the Chinese economy, which is widely expected to slow down in 2018 amid a cooling property market and slackening export demand,” said Liu Xuezhi, an economist with Bank of Communications. The Chinese economy has already showed signs of softness in the final quarter of the year. Growth in China’s industrial output, a rough proxy for economic expansion, decelerated for a second straight month to 6.1% in November, compared with a 6.2% increase in October, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday. While there was a clear pickup in external demand last month, industrial production was likely hurt by an antipollution crackdown in the country’s northeast, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist with Capital Economics. Growth in fixed-asset investment slowed for a fifth straight month to 7.2% in the first 11 months of 2017 from a year earlier, compared with a 7.3% increase over the January-October period. The deceleration last month was mainly due to slower property investment. Such investment, including commercial and residential real estate, grew 7.5% in the January-November period, compared with a 7.8% rise in the first 10 months of the year. Retail sales, one of the bright spots in the Chinese economy this year, also came in lower than expectations at 10.2%. Economists expected a 10.3% increase given record online sales on the “Singles Day” shopping spree midmonth. China observers earlier this year had estimated a significant slowdown in growth after aggressive moves to reduce excessive borrowing and restrict home speculations. Instead, the Chinese economy grew 6.9% in the first halfand only lost steam slightly in the third quarter. Economists attribute the unexpected strength to strong home sales, more government spending on infrastructure projects and robust global demand for Chinese goods. But with additional interest-rate increases and continued tightening in the market, the economic outlook may dim, Mr. Liu with Bank of Communications said. OCBC economist Tommy Xie said the PBOC’s rate increase showed that Fed policy is still one of the parameters for Beijing’s policy. “The adjustment of China’s money-market-rate increase will continue to remind investors that financial deleveraging is a long-haul project for China,” said Mr. Xie. However, due to the concerns around growth, economists say a benchmark-rate increase, in addition to Thursday’s market-rate increases, is unlikely as it would lift borrowing costs for all bank loans.

2017-12-14 12:55:00,"Fed Raises Rates | Yellen's Final Rate Rise Draws Dissent | PBOC Raises Rates Hours After Fed | Questions for the ECB's Meeting | Torry's Take: Yellen's Parting Shot Tees Up Perplexing Year For Fed; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Thursday, December 14, 2017","Torry's Take: Yellen's Parting Shot Tees Up Perplexing Year For Fed Fed Raises Rates, Sticks to Forecast for 2018 Increases Yellen's Final Rate Rise Draws Dissent Driven by Weak Inflation Fears China's Central Bank Raises Market Rates Hours After Fed Move Five Questions for the European Central Bank's Policy Meeting Yellen's Parting Shot Tees Up Perplexing Year For Fed Several things happened at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday. The decision to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point was the most straightforward of them, but garnered the least attention. Indeed, the biggest surprise was the comparative lack of action. Officials barely shifted their projections for inflation and the path of rate increases over the next few years, despite strong readings on economic growth and a booming labor market in recent months. On weak inflation, Ms. Yellen still thinks factors holding it down will prove transitory. But she cautioned that ""this could end up being something that is more ingrained and turns out to be permanent, it's very important to watch it and, if necessary, rethink."" Fed policy makers made a few tweaks on their assessment of employment. Their statement added the word ""strong"" in two places to describe the labor market, and officials lowered their forecasts for the level of unemployment over the next few years. But officials were backed into that corner weeks ago, when the unemployment rate for October dropped to 4.1% -- the level that officials in September predicted they wouldn't hit until the end of 2018. The prospect of fiscal stimulus from looming tax cuts contributed to the most significant shift in officials' expectations. Their median estimate for annual growth in gross domestic product jumped to a rate of 2.5% in 2018 from 2.1% in their September projections. Outgoing Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, diplomatic to the end, tiptoed around questions about whether now is the right time for fiscal stimulus, and reiterated that decisions on fiscal policy are up to the executive branch and Congress. Her parting shot to the Trump administration was clear however: it will be tricky for tax cuts to pay for faster economic growth. The Trump White House expects that if the U.S. economy achieves the rapid growth it views as feasible under its economic policies, that expansion will generate enough money to pay for the $1.4 trillion tax overhaul. But the tax overhaul nearing passage would result in a higher debt-to-GDP ratio, according to Ms. Yellen, and ""taking what is already a significant problem and making it worse is of concern to me."" When asked whether the tax plan can produce annual 4% economic growth, she said ""it would be challenging to achieve numbers like that."" Key Developments Around the World Fed Raises Rates, Sticks to Forecast for 2018 Increases By Nick Timiraos WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve showed continued optimism about the U.S. economy in voting Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates for the third time this year, and signaling it would stay on a similar path next year amid a leadership transition. Officials nudged their economic-growth estimates higher for the next few years on expectations that congressional Republicans will pass tax cuts. But the Fed policy makers' new projections suggest the boost wouldn't be so large that they would have to speed up the pace of rate increases to guard against too much inflation. ""At the moment the U.S. economy is performing well,"" Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a press conference after the central bank's two-day policy meeting ended Wednesday. ""The growth that we're seeing, it's not based on, for example, an unsustainable buildup of debt,"" she added. ""The global economy is doing well. We're in a synchronized expansion. This is the first time in many years we've seen this."" The Fed said it would increase its benchmark federal-funds rate Thursday by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%, the fifth such increase in the past two years. Officials penciled in three quarter-point rate increases for next year, as they had in September, and two such increases each in 2019 and 2020. The big question heading into their two-day meeting was how much Fed officials expected to lift rates in coming years. The prospect of new fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts, combined with solid hiring and lofty asset values, could argue for picking up the pace to prevent the economy from overheating. But low inflation and modest wage growth could support the case for sticking with a gradual approach. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans joined Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Wednesday in casting two dissenting votes, against seven in favor or raising rates. Both have cited weak inflation as a reason to hold off. Fed officials projected the economy would grow 2.5% next year, up from the 2.1% they predicted in September. They also expect the unemployment rate will fall to 3.9% by the end of next year, down from their earlier forecast of 4.1%. Officials didn't project more interest-rate increases or higher inflation because price pressures have been surprisingly muted this year. They still project inflation to rise to their 2% target by 2019, the same as they expected in September. ""It could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective,"" Ms. Yellen said Wednesday. Economists said the latest projections and Ms. Yellen's comments Wednesday show officials believe growth won't generate as much inflation as previously thought. ""If inflation does actually pick up, it implies that they move more rapidly"" to raise rates, said Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities. Fed officials slashed their benchmark federal-funds rate to near zero during the financial crisis and held it there for seven years before raising it by a quarter percentage point in December 2015, the start of a gradual series of small increases. In October, the Fed also started shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets, most of which were purchased as part of extraordinary postcrisis measures to support the economy. Since officials last met in early November, Congress has moved rapidly on legislation that would cut business and individual taxes by around $1.4 trillion over the next decade. Before this week, many Fed officials refrained from building into their forecasts much prospect of fiscal stimulus because it wasn't clear what Congress would pass. House and Senate Republicans are reconciling different versions of tax bills that have passed their respective chambers with the goal of putting a unified plan before President Donald Trump to sign by Christmas. The White House has said the plan can boost growth to levels that make up for revenue shortfalls. An analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found the tax bill wouldn't pay for itself with more economic growth and instead would result in about $1 trillion in additional budget deficits over a decade. Fed officials' projections show they don't see the tax cut raising the economy's long-run growth rate, which they left unchanged at 1.8%. ""It's fair to say that the Fed doesn't see the tax package as a game changer in terms of growth—just some modest upside, concentrated mostly in 2018,"" said Roberto Perli, an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro LP. While officials have now largely incorporated the effects of tax changes into their growth forecasts, Ms. Yellen said, ""importantly, you really don't at the end of the day see very much change in the federal-funds rate path."" Ms. Yellen added that she remained concerned higher budget deficits could leave fiscal policy makers with less scope to respond aggressively to an economic downturn in the future. Budget deficits are projected to grow as the baby boom ages, even before the added effect of tax cuts. ""Taking what is already a significant problem and making it worse, it is a concern to me,"" she said. While Ms. Yellen will preside over one more Fed meeting early next year, Wednesday featured her last scheduled press conference before her term ends Feb. 3. While she is likely to hand her successor an economy in far better shape than when she took over four years ago, the Fed faces several balancing acts. On one hand, inflation has run below its annual 2% target most of this year, reaching just 1.6% in October by the central bank's preferred gauge. On the other hand, with the economy so strong and more stimulus on the way, they don't want to hold rates too low for too long and cause price pressures to surge out of control or fuel asset bubbles and other financial imbalances. Now that the Fed has successfully moved interest rates away from zero and initiated the steady wind down of the portfolio, ""the battle is over the terminal fed-funds rate, and how quickly you get to it,"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist of Standish Mellon and former director of the Fed's monetary policy division. Fed officials' new projections show they see that longer-run level at around 2.75%, implying the Fed is already about half way there. Mr. Trump's nominee to succeed Ms. Yellen as central bank chief, Fed governor Jerome Powell, has indicated he could offer a lighter touch on financial regulation but has shown few signs of diverging from Ms. Yellen on monetary policy. Ms. Yellen has said she would resign her seat on the Fed's seven-member board once Mr. Powell is confirmed and sworn in, making her the third governor to leave within a year and giving Mr. Trump another opportunity to reshape the Fed. Fed officials also are wrestling with the fact that the economy isn't responding to its rate moves as it did in the past, making it harder to discern the right policy path. Fed increases in short-term rates used to tighten credit more broadly, causing bond yields to rise and boosting other borrowing costs, such as for mortgages, credit cards and business loans. This year, instead, financial conditions have eased, with stock prices rising to new highs and long-term bond yields remaining low, due in part to easy-money policies from central banks in Europe and Japan. Banks have held rates on savings deposits at historically low levels. The average interest rate paid by the biggest U.S. banks on interest-bearing deposits rose to 0.40% in the third quarter, up from 0.34% in the second quarter, according to Autonomous Research. Low interest rates have been a pleasant surprise for Joe Williams, 33, who is looking to trade up to a larger home to make room for a growing family. Mr. Williams, who works in retail operations, and his wife are preapproved for a 30-year mortgage that carries a 3.75% interest rate for the first seven years. That is higher than the 3.125% rate he locked in on his Minneapolis home two years ago. If rates looked likely to rise faster, ""that would motivate us to get a little bit more aggressive"" in buying the move-up home, he said. Greg Ip's Analysis By Greg Ip With U.S. unemployment at 4.1% and the economy at full capacity, the conventional wisdom is that this is the wrong time for Republicans to cut taxes by $1.4 trillion over the next decade. The fiscal stimulus will overheat the economy and force the Federal Reserve to slow it down by raising interest rates more aggressively. That conventional wisdom may be wrong. Fed officials, in the projections released yesterday and in Chairwoman Janet Yellen's remarks, suggest they aren't standing in the way of any boost that the tax cut delivers. Indeed, it may not be entirely unwelcome. The reasons are twofold. One is that inflation is still too low, and that completely changes the equation: It suggests overheating is to be welcomed, not resisted. The other is that officials are open to the possibility that the tax cut will raise the economy's potential growth rate, which means faster growth wouldn't necessarily lead to more inflation. That isn't their base case, which may irritate President Donald Trump. But more important for Mr. Trump is that Ms. Yellen and her likely successor, Fed governor Jerome Powell, aren't yet the party poopers many supply-side tax cut advocates feared. ""My fears have not been realized,"" Larry Kudlow, an economist and radio host who has informally advised Mr. Trump, said in an interview Wednesday. The real test, he said, is how the Fed reacts if growth tops 3%, as he expects: ""We have to wait and see."" Start with the projections. Fed officials now expect growth to average 2.3% from 2017 to 2020, up from 2.1% in September, and unemployment to average 4%, down from 4.2%. Yet officials foresee virtually no change in inflation or any need to raise rates faster. This seems at odds with the Fed's view of the world, embodied by the ""Phillips curve,"" which predicts inflation to pick up as unemployment drops further below its long-term rate, estimated by the Fed to be around 4.6%. In her press conference Wednesday, Ms. Yellen explained that officials do expect the tax cut to raise growth and lower unemployment, but ""counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than you expect. It could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective."" Indeed, the Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices, excluding energy and food, rose less than economists expected in November, perpetuating the puzzle of why inflation remains stuck below the Fed's 2% target. At his Senate confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Powell suggested the economy might not be at full employment because so many adult workers have dropped out of the labor force and aren't recorded as unemployed. In such circumstances the Phillips curve dictates that the Fed slow or even halt the pace of interest-rate increases to get unemployment even lower. But fiscal stimulus can accomplish the same thing, and indeed Fed officials in past years routinely implored fiscal policy makers to share the burden of boosting growth. The latest projections suggest there remains some merit to the argument. Though perhaps for not much longer. By 2020 Fed officials expect their benchmark federal-funds rate to reach 3.1%, which would be above the 2.8% they expect to prevail in a fully-employed economy growing normally. This is a sign they think the economy could overheat and need the Fed to press the brakes. When it has tried this in the past, the Fed has often overshot and pushed the economy into recession, precisely the outcome Mr. Kudlow and other supply-siders fear. But three years is a long time, long enough to tell if the tax cut has the supply-side benefits proponents such as Mr. Kudlow claim. If it does, then in an economy with ""disturbingly low productivity growth, that would be welcome and could support faster [gross domestic product] growth, at least for some period, without creating a need to tighten monetary policy to offset that,"" Ms. Yellen said. In other words, it doesn't matter much what the Fed thinks right now about what the tax cut will accomplish; it will let the data answer that question and adjust interest rates accordingly. This outlook isn't an endorsement. Ms. Yellen made it clear she didn't agree with Mr. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the tax cut would pay for itself, and warned it may be ""taking what is already a significant [debt] problem and making it worse."" If she were running fiscal policy, it isn't what she would choose to do. While this isn't what Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to hear, Ms. Yellen's monetary actions matter far more than her fiscal words and on that front, they so far have little to fear. Yellen's Final Rate Rise Draws Dissent Driven by Weak Inflation Fears By Michael S. Derby Janet Yellen's penultimate meeting as Federal Reserve chairwoman saw the central bank chief deliver the fifth rate rise of her tenure to notable formal opposition, as some officials continued to worry weak inflation negates the need for action. Ms. Yellen moves to close out her term—she steps down early next year—having faced about the same level of formal dissension as her predecessor Ben Bernanke. In the final tally, opposition to Ms. Yellen's preferred policies never really seemed to affect what the Fed did. But as is often the case with dissenting votes on the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, opposing views helped illustrate the difficult choices and uncertainties policy makers have faced as they tried to move monetary policy away crisis-era settings. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago leader Charles Evans both voted against the decision to lift the central bank's overnight target rate to a range between 1.25% and 1.50%. The two ""no"" votes weren't that much of a surprise. Mr. Kashkari, a new regional Fed bank president in his first-ever voting rotation on the rate-setting FOMC this year, has spent much of the year arguing the central bank's long-running inability to get inflation back up to its 2% target means no rate rises are needed. Mr. Evans, who has led his bank since 2007, has spent much of the year sounding somewhat uncomfortable with the push to raise rates in the current inflation landscape. The December FOMC meeting represented the first time this year he has moved to formally break with colleagues about the right path for monetary policy. The laserlike focus of markets and the media on the Fed, joined with an explosion of so-called Fedspeak, may have given the impression Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke faces a more unruly FOMC. But history shows that isn't the case. Mr. Bernanke, who led the Fed until from early 2006 until early 2014, oversaw 66 FOMC meetings in a tenure that spanned the start of the financial crisis, the crash and the Fed's extraordinary efforts to put the economy back on better footing. Experimentation with a host of never-before-tried policies like detailed guidance about the future of rates, extended periods of near-zero interest rates, financial-sector bailouts and three rounds of long-term bond buying ruffled a lot of feathers among Fed leaders. Mr. Bernanke garnered 48 dissenting votes at 41 of the meetings. Sometimes they came in bulk, like the triple-dissent meetings held in August and September of 2011. Ms. Yellen, in contrast, has presided over 31 FOMC meetings during her single, four-year term as chairwoman. Fifteen of those meetings have seen dissents, for a total of 22 ""no"" votes. Over her term, a number of the votes against Ms. Yellen's preferred policy path came from officials who felt she wasn't moving quickly enough to take policy off its emergency footing. Officials like Kansas City Fed leader Esther George favored rate rises through much of 2016, fearing overly easy policy was setting the stage for a potential inflation surge and unstable markets. Neither of those fears have come to pass. Ms. Yellen's first year on the job proved particularly contentious as the Fed slowly wound down it bond-buying campaign. Some officials wanted the Fed to signal a return to more normal policy sooner than was happening, while then Minneapolis Fed chief Narayana Kocherlakota worried the Fed was undermining confidence that inflation would rise back to 2%. Mr. Kocherlaktoa feared the Fed was being too hasty at moving away from ultra-easy policy. Late 2015 and 2016 were also sticky times, as some officials wanted the Fed to start raising rates sooner than Ms. Yellen and the FOMC majority thought prudent. Broad and sustained votes against the FOMC consensus have ebbed and flowed over history, and have tended to rise during challenging economic times. According to the St. Louis Fed, Fed leaders between 1934 and 1978 saw few dissenting votes. That changed during the high-inflation, low-growth world of G. William Miller through to the term of Paul Volcker, who broke the back of surging price pressures with then radical short-term interest rate increases. Dissent cooled during Alan Greenspan's leadership between 1987 and 2006. The so-called Maestro was known for ruling the FOMC with an iron hand, pushing back against those who would publicly challenge his views. Both Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen were recognized for welcoming a more open policy debate relative to Mr. Greenspan, and both were strong supporters of officials explaining their positions to the world. They also recognized that dissenting votes showed the central bank wasn't beset by one-sided views of the world. Yellen: No Big Differences Between Her, Powell on Bank Rules By Ryan Tracy WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen doesn't expect the Fed will dramatically depart from its current course on bank rules after she leaves early next year. ""All of my colleagues on the board have expressed a strong commitment to keep in place the core reforms that have produced a stronger financial system,"" Ms. Yellen said Wednesday in what was likely her final press conference as head of the central bank. ""I have not seen anything emerge at this point that I would describe as a significant difference."" Current Fed governor Jerome Powell is awaiting Senate confirmation as the next Fed chief. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles, a Trump appointee, recently joined the Fed as the point person on financial regulation. Ms. Yellen sees ""broad-based commitment"" to those ""core reforms,"" such as stress testing and higher banks capital requirements. ""I think all of us agree that it is appropriate to tailor regulatory requirements"" and the Fed could do better in alleviating regulatory burden on community banks, she added. Ms. Yellen also said the U.S. has made ""substantial progress"" on making big banks' bailouts less likely in the future, but stopped short of echoing Mr. Powell's recent statement that big U.S. banks are no longer ""too big to fail."" Ms. Yellen hedged her answer, pointing to progress made in ensuring a huge bank could be unwound in an orderly way while adding: ""I think it is an ongoing process."" Asked about the rapid rise in the value of the digital currency bitcoin, Ms. Yellen said it plays a very small role in the payment system, ""is not a stable store of value"" and ""is a highly speculative asset."" She said the Fed doesn't have any role in regulating bitcoin, other than assuring banks are appropriately managing ""any interactions they have with participants in that market and appropriately monitoring anti-money-laundering...responsibilities."" ""I still see the financial stability risks from [bitcoin] as limited,"" she said. ""Risks threatening financial stability arise when there is exposure to the banking system to fluctuating asset valuations, and I really don't see any significant exposure of our core financial institutions to threats from bitcoin."" ""Undoubtedly there are individuals who could lose a lot of money if bitcoin were to fall in price but I really don't see that as creating a full-blown financial stability risk,"" Ms. Yellen said. Fed's Brainard: Many Discouraged Workers Have Come Off Sidelines By Harriet Torry Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said Wednesday that today's strong job market has drawn many discouraged workers back into the labor force. ""In the past few years, the job market has gotten so strong that many [discouraged workers] have come off the sidelines—and many are now back at work,"" she said in remarks prepared for delivery in Rochester, N.Y. Ms. Brainard said the current 4.1% unemployment rate is a ""relatively low level by historical standards"" and that ""this is a great time"" for young people to find a job. Ms. Brainard didn't comment on monetary policy or the path of interest rates in opening remarks to a workforce development campaign awards ceremony. Earlier Wednesday, the Fed said it was raising its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%. Officials' projections showed they expect this rate increase, the Fed's third this year, to be followed by three more rate increases in 2018. U.S. Economic Expansion Could Become Longest on Record By Ben Leubsdorf Forecasters are increasingly optimistic the U.S. economic expansion could continue beyond the 2020 presidential election, aided by Republican tax legislation that is expected to lift growth over the next several years. The slow-but-sturdy expansion that began in mid-2009 already is the third-longest in U.S. history and, if it continues into the second half of 2019, will exceed the 10-year record set by the 1990s economic boom. Most of the private-sector economic forecasters surveyed in recent days by The Wall Street Journal said the odds of a new recession by late 2020 were below 50%. The average probability of a recession in the next year was 14%, with the odds creeping up to 29% in two years and 43% in three years. Economists were more pessimistic about the outlook before Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016. In the Journal's October 2016 survey, economists on average saw a 58% probability of a recession starting in the next four years. The lower recession odds could reflect a number of factors, not least the economy's strong performance over the past year. Another possible contributor is legislation overhauling the tax code that Congress may soon send to Mr. Trump's desk. Some 90% of economists surveyed said the tax bill would increase the pace of growth for the next two years, with most seeing a modest boost to the annual growth rate for gross domestic product. Forecasters remain split over its likely long-term effects: Nearly half, 47%, said growth in the long run would be unchanged or weaker than its current trend. Those results were similar to economists' predictions in October, when the tax plan was in an earlier form. A plurality of economists surveyed, 42%, said they believed the tax bill, if enacted, would make a recession in the next three years less likely than it would have been had the tax code remained in its current form. ""Tax reform will foster greater capital formation and economic growth,"" said Thomas Kevin Swift, chief economist at the American Chemistry Council. Some 37% said the tax bill would make no difference and 22% said it would make a recession more likely by late 2020. Some of the economists who warned the tax overhaul would increase the odds of a recession pointed to the possibility of aggressive interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve if the central bank feels fiscal stimulus will cause the economy to overheat and generate damaging inflation. ""Tax-cut stimulus, if fully realized as its framers claim, will make for a very aggressive Fed response, upsetting the apple cart,"" said Rajeev Dhawan, director of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center. As 2017 draws to a close, forecasters predicted this year's strong growth would continue into 2018, and the odds of a near-term downturn continued to fall. On average, economists projected GDP growth of 2.5% this year and 2.6% in 2018, followed by a return in 2019 and 2020 to the roughly 2% trend that has prevailed since the 2007-09 recession. Economists saw the pace of hiring moderating over the next year and the unemployment rate dipping below 4% by the end of 2018. Some 68% of economists said risks to the outlook for growth were tilted to the upside, while 23% saw risks tilted to the downside and 9% said the risks were balanced. Upside risks included fiscal stimulus, while disruptions to foreign trade were listed by a number of forecasters as a downside risk. The Journal's latest survey of 62 business, academic and financial economists was conducted Dec. 8-11. Not every economist answered every question. China's Central Bank Raises Market Rates Hours After Fed Move BEIJING—China's central bank followed a U.S. interest-rate increase with one of its own to blunt the effect of the Federal Reserve move on the Chinese economy, which cooled further in November. The People's Bank of China on Thursday raised two key short-term interest rates, hours after the U.S. Fed's third interest-rate increase this year. Economists say they expect the world's second-largest economy to feel more pains of soaring funding costs in 2018. Fed officials have penciled in three quarter-point rate increases for the year and two such increases each in 2019 and 2020. The Chinese central bank raised the rates it charges commercial banks on seven-day and 28-day loans by 0.05 percentage point each. It also raised rates for a medium-term liquidity instrument. The increases were smaller than 0.10 percentage-point moves in the first quarter, and the bank left the benchmark policy rates unchanged. The moves indicate that China's policy makers are trying to strike a balance between easing pressure on the yuan and reducing capital flight on one hand, and managing higher borrowing costs on the other. The PBOC also injected 288 billion yuan ($43.52 billion) of liquidity into the banking system on Thursday to offset the effects of the rate increases. ""The rate increases by the PBOC risk exerting more pressure on the Chinese economy, which is widely expected to slow down in 2018 amid a cooling property market and slackening export demand,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an economist with Bank of Communications. The Chinese economy has already showed signs of softness in the final quarter of the year. Growth in China's industrial output, a rough proxy for economic expansion, decelerated for a second straight month to 6.1% in November, compared with a 6.2% increase in October, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday. While there was a clear pickup in external demand last month, industrial production was likely hurt by an antipollution crackdown in the country's northeast, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist with Capital Economics. Growth in fixed-asset investment slowed for a fifth straight month to 7.2% in the first 11 months of 2017 from a year earlier, compared with a 7.3% increase over the January-October period. The deceleration last month was mainly due to slower property investment. Such investment, including commercial and residential real estate, grew 7.5% in the January-November period, compared with a 7.8% rise in the first 10 months of the year. Retail sales, one of the bright spots in the Chinese economy this year, also came in lower than expectations at 10.2%. Economists expected a 10.3% increase given record online sales on the ""Singles Day"" shopping spree midmonth. China observers earlier this year had estimated a significant slowdown in growth after aggressive moves to reduce excessive borrowing and restrict home speculations. Instead, the Chinese economy grew 6.9% in the first half and only lost steam slightly in the third quarter. Economists attribute the unexpected strength to strong home sales, more government spending on infrastructure projects and robust global demand for Chinese goods. But with additional interest-rate increases and continued tightening in the market, the economic outlook may dim, Mr. Liu with Bank of Communications said. OCBC economist Tommy Xie said the PBOC's rate increase showed that Fed policy is still one of the parameters for Beijing's policy. ""The adjustment of China's money-market-rate increase will continue to remind investors that financial deleveraging is a long-haul project for China,"" said Mr. Xie. However, due to the concerns around growth, economists say a benchmark-rate increase, in addition to Thursday's market-rate increases, is unlikely as it would lift borrowing costs for all bank loans. —Grace Zhu and Shen Hong Five Questions for the European Central Bank's Policy Meeting By Tom Fairless The European Central Bank pulled off a delicate balancing act seven weeks ago, announcing a major reduction of its bond-buying program that didn't upset financial markets. But several top ECB officials were unhappy with that decision. They have been calling publicly for a swift end to the bank's bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, or QE, pointing to accelerating economic growth across the 19-nation eurozone and side effects from years of easy money. There's no obvious need for the ECB to act again at its policy meeting Thursday. Its policy course is already set through next summer: The bank will continue buying bonds through September 2018, at a reduced pace of €30 billion ($35.3 billion) a month. Still, investors will listen closely to ECB President Mario Draghi's press conference at 8:30 a.m. EST for clues on how quickly the bank might subsequently phase out QE and follow the U.S. Federal Reserve on the path toward higher interest rates. Here are five questions ahead of the ECB's policy decision, due at 7:45 a.m. EST. What is the ECB expected to do? Nothing, yet. But some analysts expect a subtle shift in tone from Mr. Draghi, to acknowledge the strength of the eurozone's economic recovery, and perhaps to signal that QE won't go on forever. That would be a nod to the ECB officials, including the heads of the Dutch and German central banks, who are unhappy with the decision not to announce an end date for QE. How strong is the eurozone economy? It's humming. The euro area has notched 18 straight quarters of growth, and business and consumer sentiment are at postcrisis highs. New ECB staff economic forecasts, to be published Thursday, are expected to underline the rosy outlook, showing growth of around 2% at least through 2019. The forecasts for 2020 will be unveiled for the first time. So is the ECB doing too much? While growth is accelerating, inflation remains too weak. It is expected to hover around 1.5% through 2019, some way from the ECB's goal of just below 2%. Meanwhile, economic uncertainties remain. Germany is still without a new government, and Italy's populist 5 Star Movement could emerge from national elections early next year as the strongest political force. What is the ECB likely to do next? Sometime over the coming months, analysts expect the ECB to tweak its guidance to investors to indicate that QE could be wound down soon. The bank has promised to extend the program until inflation is close to its target—that pledge will likely be dropped in the months ahead. Mr. Draghi also might explain what will happen to QE after September: He said in October the program wouldn't end abruptly, but the minutes of the bank's last policy meeting suggest the topic wasn't actually discussed by ECB officials. Will the ECB be able to find enough bonds to buy next year? The latest extension of QE means the ECB soon might struggle to find enough bonds to buy. Mr. Draghi might explain how the ECB could avoid any bottlenecks, perhaps by tilting purchases toward corporate bonds at the expense of sovereigns. That would invite questions about the riskiness of such a move: The ECB stands to lose money—on paper at least—on its bonds in retailer Steinhoff International Holdings NV, bought under QE, after they were downgraded this month to junk following possible accounting irregularities at the company. Bank Indonesia Keeps Benchmark Repo Rate Unchanged at 4.25% By I Made Sentana JAKARTA—Bank Indonesia left interest rates unchanged Thursday as it maintained its support for an economy that is performing below government forecasts. The widely expected decision to stand pat came less than a day after the Federal Reserve increased U.S. rates for a third time this year, leading a pack of global central banks away from easy-money measures aimed at propping up economic growth. The Indonesian central bank kept the benchmark 7-day reverse repo rate unchanged at 4.25% for the fourth consecutive month after slashing it by a quarter percentage point both in July and August. The back-to-back cuts intended to fuel growth renewed pressure on the local currency after months of relative calm. ""Bank Indonesia views that all the measures that have been taken are enough to maintain the growth momentum,"" Bank Indonesia director for monetary policy Dody Budi Waluyo said after the monthly rate-setting meeting. Unlike some other Asian central banks, Bank Indonesia isn't expected to tighten its monetary stance soon as easing inflation and sluggish domestic consumption continue to weigh on the economy. Some economists expect Bank Indonesia to keep borrowing costs at current levels for another nine months before starting to tighten as higher U.S. interest rates weigh more heavily on the rupiah. The bank's decision follows a similar outcome from the Philippines central bank. But some other central banks in Asia did take action following the Fed's move. The People's Bank of China tweaked some of its short-term funding rates, raising them by 0.05 percentage point, while keeping the main policy rates unchanged. Hong Kong raised its base rate by a quarter of a percentage point, a reflection of the city's currency peg to the U.S. dollar. Philippines Central Bank Keeps Rates on Hold By Gaurav Raghuvanshi The Philippine central bank kept its main policy rates unchanged Thursday, sticking to its view that inflation remains manageable while it maintains support for an economy that is one of the fastest-growing in Asia. The decision came after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. rates for the third time this year as it leads a global tide of central banking away from easy money aimed at supporting economic growth. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept its overnight borrowing rate at 3.0% and its overnight lending rate at 3.5%. ""The decision is based on the assessment that the outlook for the inflation environment has been broadly unchanged,"" the BSP said. The central bank's decision was in line with the majority of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Only one surveyed economist predicted the Philippine central bank would raise rates, though some others expect a tightening cycle to start next year as U.S. interest rates continue to rise and the local currency remains weak. The Philippine economy has been growing strongly, earning an upgrade to its sovereign rating by Fitch Ratings earlier this month. Gross domestic product rose 6.9% in the third quarter from a year earlier, beating economist estimates. Despite the better-than-expected economic expansion, inflation has eased slightly after hitting a three-year high of 3.5% in October, keeping it squarely within the central bank's target range of between 2% and 4%. While the BSP stood its ground, with Bank Indonesia forecast to do the same later in the day, some other monetary authorities in Asia did take action following the Fed's move. The People's Bank of China tweaked some of its short-term funding rates, raising them by 0.05 percentage point following the Fed's move, but kept its main policy rates on hold. Hong Kong raised its base rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%, a reflection of the city's currency peg to the U.S. dollar. Iceland's Central Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged as It Upgrades Economic View By Nina Adam Iceland's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged, pointing to stronger-than-expected economic activity over the course of 2017. ""The outlook for 2017 as a whole is for stronger gross-domestic-product growth than was forecast in the November monetary bulletin,"" Sedlabanki said in a press release Wednesday. Domestic demand is likely to stay buoyant, a trend that calls for ""a tight monetary stance,"" it said. Sedlabanki has cut the rate on seven-day deposits three times this year—in May, June and October—bringing it to 4.25%. Sedlabanki said its future monetary policy stance will depend on fiscal policy and the results of wage settlements, among other things. ""If fiscal policy in 2018 proves more accommodative than was assumed in November, it will require a tighter monetary stance than would otherwise be needed,"" it cautioned. Iceland's new government has yet to present its 2018 budget proposal and medium-term fiscal plans. The slightly hawkish tone of the statement—especially the central bank's assessment of Iceland's recent economic performance and the fiscal outlook—surprised Jon Bentsson, chief economist at Islandsbanki. ""All in all, there is a lower probability of a rate reduction in the course of next year…but I still expect one or two smaller rate reductions in 2019,"" Mr. Bentsson said. Economic growth in the Nordic island of about 330,000 people has slowed this year and most private-sector economists say that the economy is headed for a soft landing. Sedlabanki forecast in November that the Icelandic economy would expand by 3.7% in 2017 after 7.4% growth in 2016. The projection appears too modest in light of the central bank's latest assessment. —Dominic Chopping contributed to this article.

In their National Bank of the Republic of Austria paper, the authors explain that rollover risk leads to countercyclical fiscal activity. These changes are associated with debt levels, they say: ""Debt buildups are triggered already by relatively mild recessions, but successful fiscal consolidations occur only in exceptionally good times."" Productivity is Rising If You Know Where to Look There are a few reasons to be optimistic about productivity growth, writes Neil Dutta in Bloomberg View. ""Much of the recent weakness in productivity growth coincided with weak growth in capital-intensive industries in the goods-producing sector. That has reversed. In 2017, the economy has enjoyed a rotation of workers into productive industries in the goods-producing sector. Manufacturing payrolls are on track for their best year since 2014. Mining industries are poised for the strongest annual employment growth since 2011. These sectors tend to be more capital intensive and more productive in comparison to service industries."" South Korea and the Bank of Japan With South Korean companies now competing for global market share against their Japan rivals in key sectors such as telecommunications and electrical machinery, the country's policy makers should pay more attention to what the Bank of Japan does, and less to actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, writes Alicia García-Herrero for the Bruegel think tank. ""The widening monetary policy divergence between the Fed and the BOJ can only harm South Korea,"" she writes. ""It is likely to result in a weaker yen and thus more effective Japanese price competition against South Korean products in global markets. South Korea should be more worried about BOJ's extremely lax stance — and the consequences of the falling value of the yen — than about monetary policy normalization by the Fed."" A bump in energy prices boosted U.S. consumer prices in November, but that masked a softening in underlying inflation trends. The number of Americans severely behind on payments on federal student loans reached roughly 4.6 million in the third quarter, a doubling from four years ago, despite a historically long stretch of U.S. job creation and steady economic growth. Australia's economy added 61,600 jobs in November, extending a strong run of employment growth since the start of the year fanned by upbeat business conditions. New Zealand's economy will grow at a slower pace than previously expected next year, though policies from a newly elected government that wants to spread the country's wealth to more people should see growth pick up further down the track, according to new forecasts.

(NYSE: HTGC) (""Hercules"" or the ""Company""), the leading specialty finance company to innovative, venture growth, pre-IPO and M&A stage companies backed by leading venture capital firms, today announced the estimated accretive impact to its debt investment portfolio attributed to the Federal Reserve - Federal Open Market Committee's (""FOMC"") increase in the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25%. Hercules anticipates a 25 basis point increase in the Prime Rate will contribute approximately $2.6 million, or $0.03 per share, of NII per annum, based on the basic weighted share outstanding as of September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, 96.7% of Hercules' debt investment portfolio of $1.3 billion, at cost, was primarily priced at PRIME or LIBOR-based floating interest rates, while 100.0% of the Company's outstanding debt obligations have a fixed rate of interest, well positioning Hercules for additional future rate increases. Given the expected increase to the Prime Rate will be taking effect in mid-December 2017, the anticipated increase is not expected to have any material impact to our NII in Q4 2017. The expected benefit from the December 2017 rate increase is expected to materialize during our 2018 operating period. Based on Hercules' Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2017, the following table illustrates the approximate annualized increase in components of net income resulting from hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, such as prime rate, assuming no changes in the Company's investments and borrowings.

2017-12-14 04:56:00,FOREX -Dollar on defensive after Fed leaves rate outlook unchanged,"* Dollar stays on defensive after its post-Fed slide * Fed raises rates, leaves rate outlook unchanged * China lifts market rates after Fed's move * Major currencies take China's higher rates in stride * Aussie dollar climbs after strong Australian jobs data (Updates prices, adds comments) By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The dollar remained on the defensive on Thursday, having tumbled after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected, but left its rate outlook for the coming years unchanged. There was limited reaction among major currencies after China raised interest rates marginally, in the wake of the Fed's move. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, eased 0.1 percent to 93.372 after falling 0.7 percent on Wednesday. The Fed raised key short-term rates by a quarter point to a range of 1.25-1.50 percent on Wednesday. The Fed projected three more hikes in both 2018 and 2019, unchanged from the last round of forecasts in September. Traders and analysts said the dollar came under pressure after the Fed's policy announcement as the U.S. central bank kept its interest rate projections steady rather than revising them higher. Some market participants had speculated the Fed could raise its interest rate projection for next year to four rate hikes, said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore. ""From the market perspective, anybody who was leaning that way basically ran for the exit,"" Innes said, referring to the dollar's drop after the Fed meeting. Against the yen, the dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 112.62 yen, after sliding 0.9 percent on Wednesday and having retreated from Tuesday's four-week high of 113.75 yen. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1836, having climbed 0.7 percent on Wednesday. The dollar was also weighed down after U.S. core consumer price data released on Wednesday showed slowing inflation, raising concerns the Fed will be less able to execute multiple rate increases next year. But some analysts see hopes for progress on U.S. tax reform, including tax cuts, lending support to the dollar. Congressional Republicans reached a deal on final tax legislation on Wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy Americans. Hours after the Fed's rate hike, China's central bank on Thursday raised interest rates for its reverse repos and medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans by 5 basis points. ""Five basis points is not going to make that much of a difference. But it is an important symbolic message in the right direction, that rates are going higher,"" said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy for United Overseas Bank in Singapore. China's move underscores the gradual moves toward monetary policy tightening taking place globally, Heng added. Data showing a surge in Australian jobs growth in November gave a lift to the Aussie, which touched a one-month high of $0.7675, and was last up 0.4 percent on the day at $0.7665 . Later on Thursday, investors will turn their focus to monetary policy decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The BoE is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5 percent on Thursday, after raising rates for the first time since 2007 last month. The ECB is seen likely to keep interest rates steady and reaffirm its existing monetary policy stance, after having decided in October to halve bond buys to 30 billion euros a month from January.

Their growth estimate for 2017 also rises to 2.5% from 2.4%. Such a significant change to next year's forecast could mean officials now see fiscal stimulus boosting growth. At the same time, they expect inflation to hold steady, and they maintain their expectation of two interest-rate increases in 2018. That suggests that, at least for now, the Fed isn't anticipating such growth to drive up prices or require them to raise rates in response--welcome signs for GOP leaders who don't want to see the central bank cut off growth.

(akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani) 1403 ET - Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari both cast dissenting votes at the Fed's December policy meeting, the first double dissent at a meeting this year and a sign of ongoing concern on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee over whether the economy is ready for higher borrowing costs given ongoing low inflation. Ahead of the December Fed meeting, Evans said his support for a rate rise would depend on signs that inflation and inflation expectations were increasing. His dissenting vote suggests the Chicago Fed president wasn't satisfied by the data he saw. Kashkari's dissenting vote comes as little surprise given his longstanding concern over weak inflation. The Minneapolis Fed president also dissented at the June and March meetings this year, when officials voted to increase borrowing costs. (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry) 1404 ET - Economic projections released by the Fed show officials now expect economic growth to surge in the next few years, well past its estimate of long-term potential output. Officials also see the unemployment rate falling to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019, well below their estimate of full employment. Under textbook economic models, that should produce a surge in inflation leading to higher interest rates from the Fed. And yet the latest projections show inflation almost unchanged from earlier projections. As before, the Fed doesn't forecast inflation returning to its 2% target until 2019. And its projections for interest rates in 2018 and 2019 haven't changed from the September projections. How can we have faster growth and a hotter labor market without stronger inflation? This could be a sign from Fed officials that they're having doubts about the power of the Phillips curve.

2017-12-13 22:36:00,Wall Street mixed as financials drag after Fed rate hike,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Wednesday pressured by the financial sector after the Federal Reserve announced a widely expected interest rate hike but kept its rate outlook for coming years even as it projected faster U.S. economic growth. The quarter-percentage-point rise in the overnight lending rate, which marked the third hike this year, came along with an increase to the Fed's 2018 gross domestic product growth forecast to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent. The Dow and the Nasdaq ended higher but the S&P could not sustain gains in choppy trading after the Fed statement. The S&P was dragged lower by a late-session tumble in bank stocks, which tend to get a profit boost from higher interest rates. The financial sector's <.SPSY> 1.3 percent drop for the day suggested, however, that investors may have expected a more hawkish Fed. ""It's a fairly dovish statement which is positive for risk assets,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. ""Always the worry with the market is if the Fed pushes back too hard and takes away the punch bowl. It just doesn't seem that they're setting the table for that at all,"" he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 80.63 points, or 0.33 percent, to end at 24,585.43, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 1.26 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,662.85 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 13.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,875.80. The consumer staples sector <.SPLRCS> was the strongest of the S&P's 11 sectors with a 0.5 percent gain. The S&P utilities <.SPLRCU> sector pared gains after hitting a session high to end up 0.3 percent. Investors were also keeping a sharp eye on progress in the Republicans' push for a U.S. tax law overhaul that would involve a corporate tax cut. Shortly before the Fed news, congressional Republicans said they had reached a deal on tax legislation and U.S. President Donald Trump said he would back a corporate tax rate of 21 percent. “The equities market is also reacting to the possibility that Congress may have a tax plan on the president’s desk by the end of the year,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, Prudential Financial, Newark, New Jersey. Earlier in the day a Labor Department report showed underlying consumer inflation slowed in November, possibly affecting the pace at which the Fed hikes rates. Investors also assessed Democrat Doug Jones' victory in a bitter fight for a U.S. Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama on Tuesday. Some participants said his win could mean trouble for Trump's policy agenda as it narrows the Republicans' already slim majority in the Senate. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 46 new lows. Volume so far on U.S. exchanges was 6.77 billion shares, compared to the 6.53 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

2017-12-13 21:53:00,"Yellen's Final Rate Rise Draws Dissent Driven by Weak Inflation Fears; Neel Kashkari, Charles Evans vote against the decision to lift overnight target rate","Janet Yellen's penultimate meeting as Federal Reserve chairwoman saw the central bank chief deliver the fifth rate rise of her tenure to notable formal opposition, as some officials continued to worry weak inflation negates the need for action. Ms. Yellen moves to close out her term—she steps down early next year—having faced about the same level of formal dissension as her predecessor Ben Bernanke. In the final tally, opposition to Ms. Yellen's preferred policies never really seemed to affect what the Fed did. But as is often the case with dissenting votes on the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, opposing views helped illustrate the difficult choices and uncertainties policy makers have faced as they tried to move monetary policy away crisis-era settings. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago leader Charles Evans both voted against the decision to lift the central bank's overnight target rate to a range between 1.25% and 1.50%. The two ""no"" votes weren't that much of a surprise. Mr. Kashkari, a new regional Fed bank president in his first-ever voting rotation on the rate-setting FOMC this year, has spent much of the year arguing the central bank's long-running inability to get inflation back up to its 2% target means no rate rises are needed. Mr. Evans, who has led his bank since 2007, has spent much of the year sounding somewhat uncomfortable with the push to raise rates in the current inflation landscape. The December FOMC meeting represented the first time this year he has moved to formally break with colleagues about the right path for monetary policy. The laserlike focus of markets and the media on the Fed, joined with an explosion of so-called Fedspeak, may have given the impression Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke faces a more unruly FOMC. But history shows that isn't the case. Mr. Bernanke, who led the Fed until from early 2006 until early 2014, oversaw 66 FOMC meetings in a tenure that spanned the start of the financial crisis, the crash and the Fed's extraordinary efforts to put the economy back on better footing. Experimentation with a host of never-before-tried policies like detailed guidance about the future of rates, extended periods of near-zero interest rates, financial-sector bailouts and three rounds of long-term bond buying ruffled a lot of feathers among Fed leaders. Mr. Bernanke garnered 48 dissenting votes at 41 of the meetings. Sometimes they came in bulk, like the triple-dissent meetings held in August and September of 2011. Ms. Yellen, in contrast, has presided over 31 FOMC meetings during her single, four-year term as chairwoman. Fifteen of those meetings have seen dissents, for a total of 22 ""no"" votes. Over her term, a number of the votes against Ms. Yellen's preferred policy path came from officials who felt she wasn't moving quickly enough to take policy off its emergency footing. Officials like Kansas City Fed leader Esther George favored rate rises through much of 2016, fearing overly easy policy was setting the stage for a potential inflation surge and unstable markets. Neither of those fears have come to pass. Ms. Yellen's first year on the job proved particularly contentious as the Fed slowly wound down it bond-buying campaign. Some officials wanted the Fed to signal a return to more normal policy sooner than was happening, while then Minneapolis Fed chief Narayana Kocherlakota worried the Fed was undermining confidence that inflation would rise back to 2%. Mr. Kocherlaktoa feared the Fed was being too hasty at moving away from ultra-easy policy. Late 2015 and 2016 were also sticky times, as some officials wanted the Fed to start raising rates sooner than Ms. Yellen and the FOMC majority thought prudent. Broad and sustained votes against the FOMC consensus have ebbed and flowed over history, and have tended to rise during challenging economic times. According to the St. Louis Fed, Fed leaders between 1934 and 1978 saw few dissenting votes. That changed during the high-inflation, low-growth world of G. William Miller through to the term of Paul Volcker, who broke the back of surging price pressures with then radical short-term interest rate increases. Dissent cooled during Alan Greenspan's leadership between 1987 and 2006. The so-called Maestro was known for ruling the FOMC with an iron hand, pushing back against those who would publicly challenge his views. Both Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen were recognized for welcoming a more open policy debate relative to Mr. Greenspan, and both were strong supporters of officials explaining their positions to the world. They also recognized that dissenting votes showed the central bank wasn't beset by one-sided views of the world. Write to Michael S.

2017-12-13 20:25:00,"WRAPUP 3-U.S. core inflation slows, puts spotlight on 2018  interest rate  outlook","(Updates with Fed rate decision) * Consumer prices increase 0.4 percent in November * CPI rises 2.2 percent year-on-year * Core CPI gains 0.1 percent; up 1.7 percent year-on-year By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer inflation slowed in November, held down by weak healthcare costs and the biggest drop in apparel prices in nearly two decades, which could impact the pace at which the Federal Reserve raises interest rates next year. Inflation has moderated for much of this year, leading to concern among some Fed officials that the factors holding back price pressures could prove more persistent. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday increased borrowing costs for a third time this year, encouraged by a tightening labor market and strengthening economy. It forecast three rate hikes in 2018. ""The lack of a sustained pickup in core CPI does make the Fed deliberations about the pace of monetary policy tightening next year more complicated,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. macro investor services at Oxford Economics in New York. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index excluding the volatile food and energy components ticked up 0.1 percent also as prices for airline fares and household furnishing fell. The so-called core CPI advanced 0.2 percent in October. As a result, the annual increase in the core CPI slowed to 1.7 percent in November from 1.8 percent in October. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target. The central bank's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has consistently undershot its target for almost 5-1/2 years. The overall CPI increased 0.4 percent in November after edging up 0.1 percent in October. That raised the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 2.0 percent in October. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose on the core CPI data and the Fed's interest rate decision, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. FISCAL STIMULUS Economists believe inflation will rise next year after Republicans in the U.S. Congress approved plans for sweeping tax cuts, including slashing the corporate income tax rate to about 20 percent from 35 percent. The fiscal stimulus will come at a time when the economy is almost at full employment. ""This expectation supports our forecast for the Fed to raise its policy rate four times next year after increasing it today,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist for Americas and Asia at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York. Last month, the cost of healthcare services slipped 0.1 percent, the first drop since May, with prices for doctor visits falling 0.8 percent. In the 12 months through November, the cost of doctor visits tumbled 1.8 percent, the biggest decline since records started in 1947. Apparel prices dropped 1.3 percent, the largest fall since September 1998, after dipping 0.1 percent in October. Economists said an unseasonably warm November probably contributed to the decline in apparel prices, as well as competition from online retailers like Amazon. ""It was one of the warmest Novembers on record, which means that people would have bought proportionally less full-price winter clothing and more discounted summer/fall clothing,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""If we're right, clothing prices will snap back in December."" Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence gained 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in October. Gasoline prices rebounded 7.3 percent after falling 2.4 percent in October. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Prices for new motor vehicles rose 0.3 percent after two straight monthly declines. There were also increases in prices of alcohol, mobile phone services and tobacco.

The Fed raised the federal funds rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%, no surprise there, and only Charles Evans and Neel Kashkari voted against raising rates today. The futures market was pricing in a 98.3% chance of a rate hike before the meeting today, according to B loomberg, down from a 100% chance yesterday. The Fed also said expects to raise rates three times next year, though I'm not sure anyone really believes it. ""It's clear that the Fed thinks it can hike three more times next year,"" writes Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""But that's a forecast that markets don't yet buy, and it's data more than rhetoric that will ultimately convince investors."" It wasn't only rates that changed. The Fed raised its 12-month growth forecasts for the U.S. economy to 2.5% in 2018, even as it acknowledged that inflation ""is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term."" That's a change from past statements, but again, not much of a surprise given today's weaker-than-expected core inflation reading. And a dovish one too, says Evercore ISI's Dennis DeBusschere, since the central bankers increased their growth forecast but left their inflation forecast unchanged. ""This is a tailwind for equities as it implies that growth has improved while inflation remains weak making the FOMC unlikely to tighten too quickly,"" he writes.

Fed officials said they would increase their benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%. Officials revised up their projections for economic growth and said they expect to keep raising rates if the economy performs in line with their forecast. Officials didn't significantly change projections about the path of interest rates or inflation even though they now expect the economy to grow faster, and the labor market to tighten further, than they did in projections released three months ago. Officials penciled in three quarter-point rate increases for next year, as they had in September, and two increases each in 2019 and 2020. New projections show officials expect the economy to grow at a 2.5% rate this year and next, up from September projections of 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively. The Fed still expects the economy will grow at 1.8% over the long-run, and Wednesday's projections show officials now expect economic growth will surpass that level through 2020. Officials didn't change their forecasts significantly around inflation, even though they now project the unemployment rate to fall to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019, down from prior forecasts of 4.1% and below the level that they expect should prevail over the long run, which was unchanged at 4.6%. In its postmeeting statement, the Fed's rate-setting committee described the job market as strong. ""The committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong,"" the statement said. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans joined Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari in casting dissenting votes Wednesday because they wanted to hold rates steady. The big question heading into their two-day meeting was how much Fed officials expected to lift rates in coming years. The prospect for new fiscal stimulus, combined with solid hiring and lofty asset values, could argue for picking up the pace to prevent the economy from overheating. But low inflation and modest wage growth could support the case for sticking with a very gradual approach. By Thursday, the Fed will have raised rates by a quarter percentage-point five times since late 2015, after keeping them near zero for seven years. In October, the Fed also started shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. Since officials last met in early November, Congress has moved rapidly on legislation that would cut business and individual taxes by around $1.4 trillion over the next decade. Before this week, many Fed officials refrained from building into their forecasts much prospect of fiscal stimulus because it wasn't clear what Congress would pass. House and Senate Republicans are reconciling different versions of tax bills that have passed their respective chambers with the goal of putting a unified plan before President Donald Trump to sign by Christmas. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen told lawmakers last month the Fed wouldn't necessarily try to prevent the economy from growing more quickly so long as fiscal policy changes spur productivity growth, which has been historically weak over the past decade. ""Look, we welcome strong growth. The Fed is not trying to stifle growth,"" Ms. Yellen said. ""We're worried about trends that could push inflation above our 2% objective."" Fed officials haven't said whether or to what degree they believe the specific provisions of the House and Senate bills would boost productivity, such as by encouraging capital formation and new business investment. That calculus will be especially important now that the unemployment rate-at 4.1%, a 17-year low-is at or below the level that many Fed officials believe will generate faster inflation. It hasn't so far, presenting a challenge for the Fed. On one hand, inflation has run below its annual 2% target most of this year, reaching just 1.6% in October by the central bank's preferred gauge. Another inflation measure, released Wednesday morning, showed a strong rise in energy prices but otherwise muted inflation in November. On the other hand, with the economy so strong and more stimulus on the way, they don't want to hold rates too low for too long and cause price pressures to surge out of control or fuel asset bubbles and other financial imbalances. Ms. Yellen told lawmakers last month modest wage increases and sluggish inflation pressures suggest ""the labor market and the economy are not significantly overheated in spite of the fact that we have a very low unemployment rate."" Ms. Yellen repeated her view last month that recent low inflation readings reflect transitory factors and that as they fade, inflation will return to 2%. But she also nodded to the possibility that the Fed's understanding of inflation is awry and that weak price pressures ""could reflect something more persistent,"" she said. Fed officials also are wrestling with the fact that the economy isn't responding to its rate moves as it did in the past, making it harder to discern the right policy path. Fed increases in short-term rates used to tighten credit more broadly, causing bond yields to rise and boosting other borrowing costs such as for mortgages, credit cards and business loans. This year, instead, financial conditions have eased, with long-term bond yields drifting lower, stock prices rising to new highs and many consumer loan rates little changed. Fed governor Jerome Powell is poised to take the lead on confronting these challenges as Ms. Yellen's successor after her term as chairwoman ends Feb. 3. Mr. Powell was nominated last month to take the helm and is awaiting Senate confirmation, but should face no difficulty after a panel voted 22-1 last week to advance his nomination. He has shown few signs of diverging sharply from Ms. Yellen on monetary policy but has indicated he could offer a lighter touch on financial regulation. Ms. Yellen has said she would resign her seat on the Fed's seven-member board once her successor takes over, which would make her the third governor to leave within a year. Mr. Trump has filled one vacancy on the board and moved to fill a second one, in addition to nominating Mr. Powell to become chairman. Mr. Trump has two more openings to fill now and will have another after Ms. Yellen leaves next year. (END) Dow Jones Newswires December 13, 2017 14:00 ET (19:00 GMT)",Dow Jones Institutional News
2017-12-13 19:57:00,Federal Reserve  Expected to Raise Rates; The bigger questions for the meeting ending today concern the path of policy in 2018 after a tax cut may have been signed into law,"The Federal Reserve is likely to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point after its two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday, the fifth such increase since the Fed began raising rates from near zero two years ago. Officials also will release new projections for unemployment, inflation, economic growth and interest rates. The central bank will release its statement and the forecasts at 2 p.m. EST, and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen will take questions from the press at 2:30 p.m. Here's what to watch: Taxing Dilemmas House and Senate lawmakers have moved rapidly to pass tax-cut legislation that could add $1.4 trillion to budget deficits over a 10-year period before factoring in any additional revenue from stronger economic growth. Since the two chambers haven't reconciled their separate bills yet, Fed officials might not have enough information to forecast how the economy will respond. But they probably have enough information to expect more fiscal stimulus than they did in projections released earlier this year. Their new economic projections will show whether they expect faster economic growth, higher inflation, lower unemployment or a more aggressive path of interest-rate increases as a result. Ms. Yellen likely will field questions on the issue at her press conference. Inflation: The Transitory Story? The Fed is likely to announce it will raise its benchmark rate to a range between 1.25% and 1.5% despite little evidence of a pickup in inflation, which softened unexpectedly earlier this year. Annual inflation nosed above the Fed's 2% target in February, but was just 1.6% in October by the Fed's preferred gauge. Ms. Yellen has said she expects soft inflation to prove temporary, particularly given continued declines in the unemployment rate and an economy growing at an annual rate between 2.5% and 3%. Officials' new projections will show whether they still expect inflation to hit 2% by 2019, as they did in September. And Ms. Yellen can expound on the inflation outlook at her press conference. Watch also to see if Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari again votes against the rate increase because of low inflation, and whether anyone else joins him in dissent. Financial Conditions While soft inflation means some Fed officials want to go slower on rate increases, easier financial conditions and concerns about rising asset values provide ammunition for those who want to keep up—or pick up—the pace. Each time the Fed has moved to make monetary policy a little less easy this year, including by starting to shrink its big bond portfolio, long-term rates have stayed low or declined while stock prices have moved higher. Ms. Yellen in the past has put more emphasis on labor-market indicators, such as the unemployment rate, in arguing for the Fed to gradually reverse its postcrisis stimulus measures. Watch what Ms. Yellen says about financial stability risks and the implications for the path of rates. How Far From Neutral With another rate increase, the Fed would be just a few more moves away from neutral, or the level at which it is neither stimulating or slowing growth. Fed officials expect this neutral level to rise in the coming years, and one of the big questions at this meeting concerns the path of rates in 2018 and 2019. With the Fed's portfolio slowly shrinking, so-called policy normalization has taken several steps forward this year. Watch the new projections to see how much officials believe interest rates need to rise from here and over what period of time. Parting Reflections President Donald Trump has nominated Fed governor Jerome Powell to succeed Ms. Yellen in February, breaking with recent precedent: The previous three Fed chairmen were all reappointed by presidents from the opposite party that put them in office. The central bank is set to gain several new policy makers next year. The seven-member Washington-based board of governors now has three vacancies, before Ms. Yellen's planned departure in February, and the New York and Richmond reserve banks will get new presidents. Ms. Yellen's press conference Wednesday is her last such scheduled appearance before her term ends Feb. 3, and she could have an opportunity to reflect on her extensive experience at the central bank as chairwoman, vice chairwoman, president of the San Francisco Fed, a governor and a staff economist. With the unemployment rate at 4.1% in November, Ms. Yellen is set to leave the Fed at a time when the thorniest policy issues involve how to keep the economy on an even keel and how to prepare for the next downturn.

2017-12-13 09:01:00,3 things to watch for from the  Federal Reserve  on Wednesday,"WASHINGTON (AP) — On the day when Janet Yellen will hold her final news conference as Federal Reserve chair, the Fed has left little doubt what it plans to do Wednesday: Raise its benchmark interest rate for the third time this year. The increase would be in line with the series of incremental rate hikes the Fed has been making to keep up with a steadily rising U.S. economy. Over time, the rate increases could mean somewhat more expensive business and consumer loans, including mortgages. But investors have barely blinked at the prospect of higher rates. The financial markets appear confident that the economy remains vigorous enough to withstand slightly higher borrowing costs. It's a testament to how far the economy has come: In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed slashed its key rate to a record low near zero — and then kept it there for seven years to support a fragile economy that had endured the Great Recession. The central bank finally raised rates modestly in December 2015 and then again in December 2016 and in March and June this year. Even so, the benchmark rate remains in a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. Investors seeking clues about what the Fed may do in the coming months will scrutinize its updated economic outlook Wednesday and assess Yellen's remarks in her last meeting with reporters before Jerome Powell succeeds her in February. Here are three things to watch for after the Fed's meeting ends: ___ STATE OF THE ECONOMY The Fed will update its economic outlook, which it does four times a year. The outlook includes its projections for inflation, unemployment, economic growth and the path of rate increases. Since the Fed's last update in September, Congress has moved to the edge of passing a tax bill that could have far-reaching consequences. Some analysts say the tax cuts could slightly raise economic growth but also swell federal deficits, which might eventually compel government spending cuts. Analysts will be watching to see whether the prospect of an economic stimulus, in the form of $1.5 trillion in tax reductions over a decade, leads the Fed to cast a brighter outlook for the economy. If so, that, in turn, could make it likelier that the Fed would decide at some point to accelerate its rate increases. In September, the Fed projected economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, at 2.4 percent this year but then slowing over the next three years until reaching 1.8 percent growth in 2020. That's far below the expectations of Trump, who has boasted that his economic program would double the lackluster 2 percent average growth during the Obama years to 4 percent annual GDP growth or better. The Fed's forecast in September had estimated that unemployment would be 4.3 percent at year's end. The rate has already reached a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The Fed also put its long-term unemployment rate — the level it sees as achieving its goal of maximum employment — at 4.6 percent. If the Fed lowers that figure, it could suggest that the policymakers are willing to accept lower unemployment without worrying about inflation. Likewise, the Fed target for average annual inflation is 2 percent. Yet inflation has remained below that level for more than five years. Fed officials have blamed temporary factors for the slowdown. But analysts will watch to see whether the Fed reduces its inflation forecast or still projects that it can achieve its 2 percent target. ___ DOT PLOTS The Fed will issue a diagram showing where each official expects to see the path of interest rates in coming years. These forecasts appear as dots representing the anonymous projections of each Fed policymaker. Analysts study any shifts in the so-called dot plot for signals about the Fed's likely rate plans. Powell stressed during his confirmation hearing that he planned to continue Yellen's gradual approach to raising rates. Many economists expect the Powell Fed to raise rates three more times in 2018. But some predict four hikes next year on the belief that the Fed will feel compelled to accelerate its rate increases to prevent the economy, fueled by Republican tax cuts, from triggering high inflation. ___ YELLEN'S GOODBYE The Fed will hold one more policy meeting before Yellen's four-year term ends Feb. 3, but Wednesday will mark her final quarterly news conference as chair. Yellen has also said that she will give up her board seat once Powell is confirmed by the Senate as the next chairman. Still, she will likely face a flurry of questions from reporters trying to determine how the Fed might respond to chronically slow inflation in 2018. Fed officials have spent much of 2017 debating what the puzzling slowdown in inflation might be signifying about the economy. Yellen is certain to be asked about that debate. Yellen, the first woman to lead the nation's central bank, will likely face questions about Trump's decision to break with a long tradition of offering a sitting Fed chairman a second four-year term. Trump chose Powell rather than renominate Yellen — as a way, he acknowledged, to put his own stamp on the Fed. At her final news conference, many Fed watchers say it's unlikely that Yellen will deviate from her typically cautious demeanor, in part out of concern that in speaking her mind, she might jeopardize what she is hoping will be a smooth handover to Powell.

2018-09-28 00:00:00,Another Recession Is Looming,"Ten years after the Great Recession's onset, another long, deep downturn may soon roil the U.S. economy. The high level of asset prices today mirrors the earlier trend in house prices that preceded the 2008 crash; both mispricings reflect long periods of very low real interest rates caused by Federal Reserve policy. Now that interest rates are rising, equity prices will fall, dragging down household wealth, consumer spending and economic activity. During the five-year period before the last downturn, the Fed had decreased the federal-funds rate to as low as 1%. That drove down mortgage interest rates, causing home prices to rise faster than 10% a year. When the Fed raised rates after 2004, the housing-price bubble burst within two years. As housing prices plummeted, homeowners with highly leveraged mortgages found themselves owing substantially more than their homes were worth. They defaulted in droves, causing lenders to foreclose on their properties. Sales of the foreclosed properties forced prices even lower, leading the national house-price index to decline 30% in three years. Banks that held mortgages and mortgage-backed bonds saw their net worths decline sharply. A total of 140 U.S. banks failed in 2009, and those that survived were terrified by how much further the market might slide. To avoid risky bets, they shied away from lending to businesses and home buyers and refused to lend to other banks whose balance sheets were also declining. The fall in home prices from 2006-09 cut household wealth by $6 trillion. Coinciding with a stock-market crash, the erased wealth caused consumer spending to drop sharply, pushing the economy into recession. The collapse of bank lending deepened the decline and slowed the recovery to a sluggish pace. Fast forward to today. Homes aren't as overvalued as they were in 2006, so there's little chance of an exact replay of the 2008 crisis. The principal risk now is that a stock-market slowdown could shrink consumer spending enough to push the economy into recession. Share prices are high today because long-term interest rates are extremely low. Today the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes is less than 3%, meaning the inflation-adjusted yield on those bonds is close to zero. The hunt for higher yields drives investors toward equities -- driving up share prices in the process. But long-term rates are beginning to rise and are likely to increase substantially in the near future. Though the 3% yield on 10-year Treasurys is still low, it's still twice as high as it was two years ago. It will be pushed higher as the Fed raises the short-term rate from today's 2% to its projected 3.4% in 2020. Rising inflation will further increase the long-term interest rate as investors demand compensation for their loss of purchasing power. And as annual federal spending deficits explode over the coming decade, it will take ever-higher long-term interest rates to get bond buyers to absorb the debt. It wouldn't be surprising to see the yield on 10-year Treasurys exceed 5%, with the resulting real yield rising from zero today to more than 2%. As short- and long-term interest rates normalize, equity prices are also likely to return to historic price-to-earnings ratios. If the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 regresses to its historical average, 40% below today's level, $10 trillion of household wealth would be wiped out. The past relationship between household wealth and consumer spending suggests such a decline would reduce annual spending by about $400 billion, shrinking gross domestic product by 2%. Add in the effects on business investment, and this spending crunch would push the economy into recession. Most recessions are short and shallow, with an average of less than a year between the start of the downturn and the beginning of the recovery. That's because the Fed usually responds to recessions by cutting the federal-funds rate substantially. But if one hits in the next few years, the Fed will not have enough room to cut rates, as the fed-funds rate is expected to rise to only 3% by 2020. There also won't be much room for a major fiscal intervention. Federal deficits are expected to exceed $1 trillion annually in the coming years, and publicly held federal debt is predicted to rise from 75% of GDP to nearly 100% by the decade's end. This means a downturn brought on in the next few years by rising long-term interest rates would likely be deeper and longer than your average recession. Unfortunately, there's nothing at this point that the Federal Reserve or any other government actor can do to prevent that from happening. --- Mr. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan, is a professor at Harvard and a member of the Journal's board of contributors.

2018-09-28 06:26:00,PRECIOUS-Gold holds near six-week lows after upbeat U.S. data,"* Stronger U.S. economic data backs Fed's rate rise view * Palladium hit fresh eight-month high (Updates prices, adds quote) By Vijaykumar Vedala BENGALURU, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Gold prices inched up on Friday but held near six-week lows hit in the previous session, as the dollar firmed after upbeat U.S. economic data supported the Federal Reserve's resolve for steady interest rate hikes over the next year. The dollar stood tall against its peers on Friday after data showed U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter at its fastest pace in nearly four years. Another report showed durable goods rose 4.5 percent in August, rebounding from a revised 1.2 percent drop the month before. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent to $1,184.91 as of 0405 GMT. On Thursday, the metal fell about 1 percent and touched its lowest since Aug. 17 at $1,181.61 an ounce. Spot gold is down about 1.2 percent for the week, on track for its fourth weekly decline in five. U.S. gold futures were up 0.1 percent at $1,188.80 an ounce. The short-term outlook is bearish for gold as the dollar may see some upside due to an ongoing trade war between China and the U.S. and the Federal Reserveinterest rate hike outlook, according to Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and said it planned four more increases by the end of 2019 and another in 2020. ""Gold has been trying to overcome the psychological level of $1,200 an ounce for the past few days. We didn't see that happening. And when it doesn't go up, it comes down,"" said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore. ""After the prices came down we have seen some physical buying mainly from the businesses, which is offering some support at this time."" Gold is down more than 13 percent from an April high, largely because of the stronger dollar, which has been boosted by a vibrant U.S. economy and fears of a global trade war. Investors have bought the greenback instead of gold as a safe investment. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's accusation of Chinese meddling in the upcoming U.S. elections marks a new phase in an escalating pressure campaign against Beijing that Washington is pursuing on multiple fronts, senior U.S. officials said on Thursday. ""The trade war continues to favour the U.S. dollar and this will generally dampen gold's upside,"" said Nicholas Frappell, global general manager, ABC Bullion, Australia. ""Large speculative shorts may help cushion weakness as punters keep an eye on levels to close out and take money off the table,"" he said. Among other metals, palladium touched a fresh eight-month high at $1,087.40 an ounce. Silver rose 0.6 percent to $14.29 an ounce and platinum declined 0.4 percent to $806.0.

2018-09-28 23:22:00,UPDATE 1-Fed's 'neutral rate' guru downplays theory as rates rise,"(Adds forecasts, comments on economy and balance sheet) By Jonathan Spicer NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's point-person on the theory of how high to raise interest rates said on Friday that estimating this ""neutral"" level is getting more difficult and less relevant as the U.S. central bank continues tightening policy. ""I continue to expect that further gradual increases in interest rates will best foster"" growth and the economy's ""very strong"" outlook through at least next year, New York Fed President John Williams told a forum of economists and students. As the Fed, which raised its policy rate above 2 percent this week, continues to hike, ""it makes sense to shift away from a focus on normalizing the stance of monetary policy relative to some benchmark 'neutral' interest rate, often referred to as 'r-star,'"" he said. The idea of an estimated neutral rate - which in a healthy economy neither boosts nor restrains investment and spending, and can move around over time - has at times dominated debate over how aggressively the Fed needed to tighten policy through the economic recovery from recession. Williams was one of the authors of this theory. Yet on Friday he said that it has at times received ""too much attention"" - sentiment that echoes recent comments downplaying such monetary models by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. ""At some point in the future it will no longer be clear whether interest rates need to go up or down, and explicit forward guidance about the future path of policy will no longer be appropriate,"" said Williams, who is among the most influential U.S. central bankers. As rates approach estimates of ""neutral,"" he added, ""what appeared to be a bright point of light is really a fuzzy blur, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in measuring r-star."" The Fed's preferred inflation gauge is near a 2 percent goal and U.S. unemployment is low at 3.9 percent. This dual-goal mandate is ""about as good as it gets,"" Williams said, predicting prices should only edge a bit above target while unemployment falls a bit below 3.5 percent next year. The Fed is meanwhile restricting credit as it trims its roughly $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds. Williams said the Fed has yet to decide how much to shrink the portfolio, which ran up from $900 billion before the 2007-09 financial crisis.

2018-09-28 21:34:00,"U.S. consumer spending rises, monthly inflation moderates","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased steadily in August, supporting expectations of solid economic growth in the third quarter, while a measure of underlying inflation remained at the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for a fourth straight month. Economists said Friday's report from the Commerce Department should allay fears of the economy overheating and likely keeps the U.S. central bank on a gradual path of interest rate increases. The Fed raised rates on Wednesday for the third time this year and removed the reference to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative."" ""Growth is solid and inflation pressures modest,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""This is exactly the environment the Fed needs to move interest rates up at a gradual pace as further rate hikes start to look like tightening."" The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.3 percent last month after an unrevised 0.4 percent gain in July. Spending last month was driven by outlays on healthcare, which offset a drop in motor vehicle purchases. August's increase in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent after climbing 0.3 percent in July. The report came on the heels of data on Thursday showing a decline in orders for key capital goods in August and a further widening of the goods trade deficit, which prompted economists to downgrade their gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter to as low as a 2.8 percent annualized rate. Third-quarter GDP growth forecasts were previously as high as a 4.4 percent pace. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter, powered by robust consumer spending. Economists said data in hand suggested that consumer spending was on track to grow at about a 3.6 percent rate in the third quarter, close to the 3.8 percent pace set in the April-June period. Consumer spending is being driven by a tightening labor market, which is starting to boost wage growth, as well as higher savings. It is also being supported by robust consumer confidence. A separate report on Friday showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index at a six-month high in September. A survey earlier this week from the Conference Board showed consumer confidence hitting an 18-year high in September. The Conference Board places more weight on the labor market. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed in late afternoon trade. EYES ON TARIFFS In August, spending on goods increased 0.3 percent, likely lifted by higher gasoline prices. Spending on goods rose 0.5 percent in July. Outlays on services advanced 0.4 percent, with spending on healthcare accounting for much of the increase. There was a moderation in monthly price gains in August. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components was unchanged. That was the weakest reading since March 2017 and followed a 0.2 percent gain in July. August's flat reading left the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 2.0 percent. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012. Economists say inflation could slightly overshoot its target amid concerns an escalating trade war between the United States and China could lead to price increase for a range of consumer goods. Washington on Monday slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods. Walmart Inc <WMT.N>, the largest U.S. retailer, said last week it might hike prices because of the duties on Chinese imports. ""With this $200 billion increase, you are effectively tripling the amount of goods subject to a tariff and that has potential to influence prices,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. JPMorgan estimates that the tariffs could add 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point to core inflation. In August, personal income rose 0.3 percent after increasing by the same margin in July. Wages jumped 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in seven months, after rising 0.3 percent in July. The saving rate was unchanged at 6.6 percent last month.

2018-09-28 00:00:00,Streetwise: Fed Doesn't Want to Hold Your Hand,"What's in a word? When it comes to the Federal Reserve, a lot. The removal of ""accommodative"" from the Fed's statement on Wednesday was interpreted as a sign that the central bank is approaching the end of its cycle of interest-rate increases, and bond yields declined slightly. But the real story is about rising uncertainty as forward guidance is replaced with an implicit shrug of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's well-tailored shoulders. Mr. Powell seemed to be going out of his way to confuse investors in his press conference. Having dropped ""accommodative"" as a description of current monetary policy -- something anticipated by many -- he went on to say of the change: ""It wasn't because policy's not accommodative. It is still accommodative."" Instead, Mr. Powell explained that the word had outlived its usefulness as a signal to the markets of what the Fed was trying to achieve. The focus on a single word highlights two important market truths: The central bank isn't focused on supporting the economy, which is doing very well by itself; and the Fed no longer feels such a need to talk down future policy rates in order to get investors to help. The result is that things are likely to get a lot more confusing for markets. The first truth is well understood, not least because interest rates are higher than the Fed's preferred measure of core inflation for the first time since Lehman Brothers collapsed a decade ago. Policy is clearly no longer such a strong support to the economy as it was when interest rates started to increase. The second is less obvious at first glance. The Fed still publishes its dot plot, setting out where policy makers expect the economy, inflation and interest rates to go. It still explains where it thinks a sustainable unemployment rate is (a median assessment of 4.5%, higher than today) and where interest rates are headed (the median is up to 3.4% by 2020, staying there for a year, before dropping back to a long-term level of 3%). And Fed policy makers frequently make speeches designed to help investors understand how the central bank will react to economic developments. Yet, Mr. Powell has been going out of his way to highlight how little the Fed really knows. On Wednesday, he emphasized the uncertainty in the dot-plot predictions two or three years ahead. He explained that the Fed doesn't have a precise understanding of what policy would be accommodative. He said that while he hopes that supply-side improvements will follow from the administration's tax cuts, it was also very uncertain. And he broached the idea that the central bank's estimate of the so-called neutral rate, where monetary policy neither supports nor detracts from economic growth, might be raised. In short: The Fed doesn't know what will happen, or how it will react. We should be careful not to go too far. The Fed never really knew what the economy would do, and it might well have breached its previous forward guidance had the economy turned out differently. After all, the Bank of Canada broke its forward guidance when its economy recovered more quickly than expected, and the Bank of England had to abandon its first attempt at guidance after six months. Yet, investors have grown used to hand-holding from central banks. Mr. Powell's step back should increase the uncertainty, meaning that a wider range of outcomes filters into prices. All else equal, that ought to mean lower stock prices and bond yields. In some ways, this fits what is going on in markets anyway, as both better and much-worse outcomes become obvious possibilities. Trade battles, Brexit, Italy and emerging-market crises are highly visible threats. Indeed, rumors about the Italian budget pushed up the dollar more against the euro on Thursday morning than the Fed did on Wednesday. Equally, the tax-cut-driven U.S. economic growth has been far stronger than expected, and inflation has stayed low, raising the chance that the U.S. helps pull up growth in the rest of the world. A wider range of outcomes should push investors to take less risk, holding fewer or more defensive stocks and more safe bonds, even if the central forecast remains unchanged. That is the true meaning of no longer being ""accommodative."" License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service",The Wall Street Journal
2018-09-28 13:30:00,"Powell Addresses Concerns About Flattening Yield Curve | Bank of England Likely to Raise Rates Further if Growth Continues | SEC Sues Elon Musk For Fraud, Seeks Exit from Tesla | Derby's Take: Fed Rate-Range Settings Could See More Tweaks; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Friday, September 28, 2018","Fed Rate-Range Settings Could See More Tweaks It looks like the Federal Reserve may not be done making technical tweaks to keep control of its interest-rate target range. The central bank's federal-funds target range now stands at 2% to 2.25%, after officials voted to raise it Wednesday. The range is widely expected to be raised again in December. The top end of that range is determined by what the Fed pays deposit-taking banks to park reserves on the central bank's books. The low end is defined by the rate offered to money funds and other eligible financial firms to do likewise. The fed-funds rate floats in between. The mechanics of setting that range have become trickier, however. Since June, the Fed has actually set the high-end interest on excess reserves, or IOER, rate lower than the top end of the fed-funds target rate range. After the Wednesday rate rise, it now stands at 2.2%. The Fed tweaked this rate in part to deal with a fed-funds rate that has been more persistently toward the top end of the range. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at his press conference following this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting that this technical move ""worked and it was successful"" at keeping the fed-funds rate in line, Mr. Powell said. While Mr. Powell didn't go into a lot of detail behind the Fed's thinking, he observed that market conditions have been putting upward pressure on the fed-funds rate. ""We think it's principally a function of just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well."" Given that Treasury supply remains high in light of an increase in budget deficits tied to Republican-backed tax cuts, the pressure on the fed-funds rate could prove persistent. The Fed may need to lower the interest rate on excess reserves even lower to maintain its range. An uptick of Treasury bill issuance and a continued drawdown of the Fed's balance sheet make for ""a compelling base case"" to push the interest rate on excess reserves even lower relative to the top of the range at the December FOMC meeting, for a year-end IOER rate of 2.40%, says Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. Fed Chairman Addresses Concerns About Flattening Yield Curve Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday played down concerns that bond markets were signaling rising odds of a recession. Mr. Powell addressed concerns over the narrowing spread between short- and longer-term Treasury yields, a difference known as the yield curve. When short-term yields rise higher than longer-term yields, the curve inverts. Over the past 50 years, a recession has almost always followed within a year or two.

The pace of U.S. economic growth cooled a bit in the third quarter after a robust April-through-June period, economists say, but should remain well above the sluggish gains posted throughout the economic expansion.

2018-09-27 22:27:00,Fed's Powell reiterates gradual approach to rate hikes,"WASHINGTON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve plans to continue raising its benchmark interest rate in a gradual manner in order to best maintain the U.S. economic expansion, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Thursday.

2018-09-28 00:46:00,"Another Recession Is Looming; And unlike in the past, the  Federal Reserve  has little room to encourage growth by reducing rates.","Ten years after the Great Recession's onset, another long, deep downturn may soon roil the U.S. economy. The high level of asset prices today mirrors the earlier trend in house prices that preceded the 2008 crash; both mispricings reflect long periods of very low real interest rates caused by Federal Reserve policy. Now that interest rates are rising, equity prices will fall, dragging down household wealth, consumer spending and economic activity. During the five-year period before the last downturn, the Fed had decreased the federal-funds rate to as low as 1%. That drove down mortgage interest rates, causing home prices to rise faster than 10% a year. When the Fed raised rates after 2004, the housing-price bubble burst within two years. As housing prices plummeted, homeowners with highly leveraged mortgages found themselves owing substantially more than their homes were worth. They defaulted in droves, causing lenders to foreclose on their properties. Sales of the foreclosed properties forced prices even lower, leading the national house-price index to decline 30% in three years. Banks that held mortgages and mortgage-backed bonds saw their net worths decline sharply. A total of 140 U.S. banks failed in 2009, and those that survived were terrified by how much further the market might slide. To avoid risky bets, they shied away from lending to businesses and home buyers and refused to lend to other banks whose balance sheets were also declining. The fall in home prices from 2006-09 cut household wealth by $6 trillion. Coinciding with a stock-market crash, the erased wealth caused consumer spending to drop sharply, pushing the economy into recession. The collapse of bank lending deepened the decline and slowed the recovery to a sluggish pace. Fast forward to today. Homes aren't as overvalued as they were in 2006, so there's little chance of an exact replay of the 2008 crisis. The principal risk now is that a stock-market slowdown could shrink consumer spending enough to push the economy into recession. Share prices are high today because long-term interest rates are extremely low. Today the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes is less than 3%, meaning the inflation-adjusted yield on those bonds is close to zero. The hunt for higher yields drives investors toward equities—driving up share prices in the process. But long-term rates are beginning to rise and are likely to increase substantially in the near future. Though the 3% yield on 10-year Treasurys is still low, it's still twice as high as it was two years ago. It will be pushed higher as the Fed raises the short-term rate from today's 2% to its projected 3.4% in 2020. Rising inflation will further increase the long-term interest rate as investors demand compensation for their loss of purchasing power. And as annual federal spending deficits explode over the coming decade, it will take ever-higher long-term interest rates to get bond buyers to absorb the debt. It wouldn't be surprising to see the yield on 10-year Treasurys exceed 5%, with the resulting real yield rising from zero today to more than 2%. As short- and long-term interest rates normalize, equity prices are also likely to return to historic price-to-earnings ratios. If the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 regresses to its historical average, 40% below today's level, $10 trillion of household wealth would be wiped out. The past relationship between household wealth and consumer spending suggests such a decline would reduce annual spending by about $400 billion, shrinking gross domestic product by 2%. Add in the effects on business investment, and this spending crunch would push the economy into recession. Most recessions are short and shallow, with an average of less than a year between the start of the downturn and the beginning of the recovery. That's because the Fed usually responds to recessions by cutting the federal-funds rate substantially. But if one hits in the next few years, the Fed will not have enough room to cut rates, as the fed-funds rate is expected to rise to only 3% by 2020. There also won't be much room for a major fiscal intervention. Federal deficits are expected to exceed $1 trillion annually in the coming years, and publicly held federal debt is predicted to rise from 75% of GDP to nearly 100% by the decade's end. This means a downturn brought on in the next few years by rising long-term interest rates would likely be deeper and longer than your average recession. Unfortunately, there's nothing at this point that the Federal Reserve or any other government actor can do to prevent that from happening.

2018-09-27 22:32:00,"Fed Chairman: Economy Is Strong, Unemployment and Inflation Are Low","WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his positive assessment of the U.S. economy, noting that borrowing costs remain low after officials raised interest rates for the third time this year. In brief remarks prepared for delivery Thursday on Capitol Hill, Mr. Powell said the quarter-point rate increase announced by the Fed on Wednesday was the latest step toward returning interest rates to ""levels that are normal in a healthy economy."" While noting that the benefits of economic growth haven't reached all Americans and that the Fed has a limited capacity to address many challenges facing the U.S., he said policy makers are ""doing all we can to keep the economy strong and moving forward."" ""Rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans,"" Mr. Powell said. Twelve out of 16 top Fed officials expect to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate once more this year, from its current level between 2% and 2.25%. Nine officials expect to raise rates at least three more times in 2019. A decade after the financial crisis, the U.S. economy is growing at a healthy pace and unemployment and inflation are low, Mr. Powell said. Thanks to higher requirements for capital and liquidity at major banks and other measures, the financial system is stronger and safer than before the crisis, he added. ""We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient,"" Mr. Powell said. 27 Sep 2018 18:49 ET  Fed Chairman Addresses Concerns About Flattening Yield Curve -- Update By Nick Timiraos WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday played down concerns that bond markets were signaling rising odds of a recession. Mr. Powell addressed concerns over the narrowing spread between short- and longer-term Treasury yields, a difference known as the yield curve. When short-term yields rise higher than longer-term yields, the curve inverts. Over the past 50 years, a recession has almost always followed within a year or two. The curve has flattened this year as the Fed has raised its short-term benchmark rate, and Mr. Powell said that was to be expected. The central bank's rate-setting committee voted Wednesday to raise the rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%. ""Some people have been very reasonably asking the question: If we invert the yield curve, will there be a recession?"" Mr. Powell said during a question-and-answer session on Capitol Hill. Looking at the economy broadly, he said, ""there's no reason to think that the probability of a recession in the next year or two is at all elevated."" Mr. Powell qualified his remarks by noting there is always some probability of a recession because many have been caused by shocks that have nothing to do with monetary policy. He spoke at a conference of Rhode Island business leaders. Mr. Powell said the yield curve is ""just one factor that you want to look at"" when setting interest-rate policy.

2018-09-27 07:46:00,Fed raises rates for 3rd time this year with 1 more expected,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve signaled its confidence Wednesday in the U.S. economy by raising a key interest rate for a third time this year, forecasting another rate hike before year's end and predicting that it will continue to tighten credit into 2020 to manage growth and inflation. The Fed lifted its short-term rate — a benchmark for many consumer and business loans — by a modest quarter-point to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. It was its eighth hike since late 2015. The central bank also stuck with a previous forecast for three more rate hikes in 2019. In a statement after its latest policy meeting, the Fed dropped phrasing it had long used that characterized its policy as ""accommodative"" — that is, favoring low rates. The Fed had used variations of that pledge in the seven years that it kept its key rate at a record low near zero and over the past nearly three years in which it's gradually tightened credit. By removing that language, the Fed may be signaling its resolve to keep raising rates. In a news conference after its meeting, though, Chairman Jerome Powell said the removal of the ""accommodative"" language did not amount to a policy change. ""Our economy is strong,"" Powell declared at the start of his news conference. ""Growth is running at a healthy clip, unemployment is low. The number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable, all of these are very good signs."" The chairman added, though: ""That's not to say everything is perfect. The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans. Many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed."" The Fed's actions and its updated economic forecasts Wednesday had been widely anticipated. Initially, there was little reaction in the stock or bond markets. But later in the afternoon, stocks sold off, and major indexes closed modestly lower. ""The Fed stuck to script today, pushing ahead with another rate hike,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. But Pearce added, ""Our view is that officials are still underestimating just how quickly the economy is likely to lose momentum next year."" He said he expects the Fed to suspend its rate hikes by mid-2019 — and then feel compelled to cut rates by early 2020 to support the economy. In its updated outlook Wednesday, the Fed foresees one final rate hike after 2019 — in 2020 — which would leave its benchmark at 3.4 percent. At that point, it would regard its policy as modestly restraining growth. The Fed seeks to slow the economy when it reaches full employment to prevent a tight job market from raising inflation too high. During a late-afternoon news conference in New York, President Donald Trump said he was ""not happy"" about the Fed's latest rate hike. In a highly unusual move for a president, Trump has publicly complained that the Fed's rate increases could blunt his efforts to boost growth through tax cuts and deregulation. Earlier, Powell said during his news conference that such outside criticism would have no effect on the Fed's use of rates to try to maximize employment and stabilize prices. ""We've been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people,"" Powell said. ""My colleagues and I are focused, exclusively, on carrying out that mission."" The Fed's latest forecast predicts that the unemployment rate, now 3.9 percent, will reach 3.7 percent by the end of this year and then 3.5 percent next year. Not since the late 1960s has unemployment fallen that low. The central bank expects unemployment to begin rising to 3.7 percent at the end of 2021. It foresees the economy growing 3.1 percent this year before slowing to 2.5 percent in 2019, 2 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021. The Fed sees the economy's long-run growth at a 1.8 percent annual rate — far below the Trump administration's projections for a sustained rate of 3 percent. Many analysts think the economy could weaken next year, in part from the effects of the trade conflicts Trump has pursued with China, Canada, Europe and other trading partners. The tariffs Trump has imposed on imported steel and Chinese goods, in particular, complicate the Fed's decision-making. That's because the tariffs — and the resulting retaliation from America's trading partners — could weaken the U.S. economy. The Fed would normally respond to weaker growth by cutting interest rates. But tariffs, which are an import tax, can inflate prices. And the Fed typically counters higher inflation by raising rates. Megan Greene, global chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said she thought the tariffs were more likely to slow the economy than to accelerate inflation. ""The real risk of trade wars,"" Greene wrote last week, ""is a hit to growth, not a boost to inflation."" Indeed, the Fed's regional banks have reported that some businesses are delaying investments until they see some resolution to the trade hostilities. In his news conference, Powell said some companies have told Fed officials that the tariffs have raised fears that supply chains will be disrupted and raw materials will cost more. Powell said he had yet to see evidence that the administration's tariffs have raised prices for many consumers. But he said rising inflation remains a threat resulting from Trump's trade policies. ""It's a concern,"" Powell said. ""It's a risk. You could see prices moving up. You don't see it yet. But you could see retail prices moving up. The tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they've been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices."" ___ AP Economics Writers Josh Boak, Paul Wiseman and Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report.

2018-09-27 19:33:00,"Transcript: Jerome Powell's September Postmeeting Press Conference; Fed chairman discusses the outlook for interest rates, labor-force participation rates and financial stability issues","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell addressed the media Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018, after the central bank's decision to raise short-term interest rates for the third time this year. He discussed a range of issues, including the outlook for interest rates, strength in the U.S. economy, positive signs in labor-force participation and how financial stability risks appear to be moderate. Here is a transcript of his comments, lightly edited for length and clarity. JEROME POWELL: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here. I am going to start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the economy, what we decided today, and then a bit about our expectations for the months ahead. Our economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip, unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. All of these are very good signs. Of course, that's not to say that everything's perfect. The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans. Many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward. That is the best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed. Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation? For many years this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago. As the economy has steadily gained strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that are normal in a healthy economy. We took another step on that path today with a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates. These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans. As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis – a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and for some their hopes and dreams. In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer. In particular, we're holding the largest banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liquidity they hold, and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take. I'm confident that this system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad. We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient. Now let me go into more detail about the developments that motivated today's policy decision. Both household spending and business investment are expanding briskly, and the overall growth outlook remains favorable, and several factors support this assessment. Fiscal policy is boosting the economy. Ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative. These conditions are consistent with our summary of economic projections for this meeting. The meeting of committee participants projections for the growth of real [gross domestic product] is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year. Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months – well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percent in August and has been near that level since April. Smoothing through month-to-month variations, the labor-force participation rate remains about where it was in late 2013 – a positive sign given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on participation. We expect the job market to remain strong. And the median of committee participants' projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent, and a bit lower than that in 2019. Overall, consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, PCE inflation, increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July. The core price index – which excludes the prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation – rose 2 percent over the same period. The [Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee] seeks and expects to see inflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis. At any given time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent. For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we expect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections. The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 percent across the whole projection horizon. Today, the committee raised the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percent. This action reflects the strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three years ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels. Looking ahead, today's projections show gradual interest-rate increases continuing, roughly, as foreseen in June. The meeting of participants' views on appropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June meeting. These projections play an important role in our work. My colleagues and I believe that it's useful to communicate our views on likely prospects for the economy and for policy. We are well aware, however, that the economy regularly surprises and that even the most carefully constructed projections are highly uncertain. The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evolves, broadly, in line with the projections for growth, employment, unemployment and inflation. If the economy were instead to falter, lower interest rates would be appropriate. Conversely, if inflationary pressures were to rise more than expected, higher interest rates would be appropriate. Right now, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook appear, roughly, balanced. Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the committee dropped a sentence that indicated that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. This change does not signal any change in the likely path of policy. Instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations. We still expect, as our statement says, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal-funds rate, and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I just discussed. Thanks very much. I'm happy to take your questions. Q: Thank you. Nick Timiraos of The Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, given the lags of monetary policy, I want to know how you think about ending the tightening cycle. How will you know when to stop and do you need to keep going until something in the economy breaks? MR. POWELL: So the tightening cycle, as you know, is a reflection of the strength of the economy and it's almost three years now that we've been gradually raising rates, and I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually in a way allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates, and the fact that we're moving so gradually I think – I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we're being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases and, so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations. Q: Thanks. Hi. Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times. President Trump has stated publicly he's not thrilled with the interest-rate hikes. His comments didn't appear to have any impact on you or your colleagues. Were his comments discussed at your meeting, and do you have any concerns about the effect of these types of comments on the perception of the Fed's independence and your monetary policy? MR. POWELL: So we've been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress and we've been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission. We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence. We have disparate points of view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a context of price stability. That's what we do. We don't consider political factors or things like that, and so that's who we are, that's what we do, and that's just the way it's always going to be for us. Q: Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you explain how – the stock market being at or near all-times high, corporate spreads being very tight, how does the level of the market factor into your decisions to raise interest rates? Is there a concern on your part? And then as sort of a second and related part, can you tell us what happens in 2020 and 2021 that – I know you can't tell us – you're shaking your head – (laughter) – that prompts – that prompts you – the Fed to think that rates need to still be above neutral in that time period? Thank you. MR. POWELL: Sure. So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we, as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy and they're one of the many things that we take into account. The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal-funds rate and that has – that has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest-rate curve and into financial asset prices generally. So the answer is we take – we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account. In terms of '20 and '21, why – your question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral. So you're right, some of – some of the participants have mostly very modest overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple or three years out. You know, it's far out into the future. I think it's hard to be confident that that's – that that's the way things are going to be. What we're going to be doing as we – as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals. And I think that that's an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road. And I'll leave it at that. Q: Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Chairman Powell, I think – is this too good to be true? Because you've got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent, very low, substantially below NAIRU [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment], what appears to be NAIRU, but no reaction of inflation there. And so I don't think that's ever happened since the 1960s. Why do you think it's going to happen now? Or in the alternative, is this forecast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence intervals to the extent that, well, we don't know what else to do so just extend the line out until something happens? MR. POWELL: No, you're right, the committee forecasts what they – what they show in general is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent. That is what the forecast shows. And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now on the – on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack, that is to say a flat Phillips curve. And it's just – it's a – it's a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations. And that's not just our forecasts, that's many forecasts. So that is – that is – that is the forecast. So you may ask – I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean? And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run. But obviously, that longer run, you know, it's not creating problems in the short run for that forecast. Now, let's just admit that the inflation process has changed dramatically from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It's in a good place now. We can't take for granted that it will remain the way it is. And, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully if inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly...then we'll adjust policy appropriately. Q: If I – if I could follow up on that. What are you buying with interest rates – MR. POWELL: Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effects – I mean, if – I guess your question was, what are you buying by raising interest rates? The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn't raise rates? It would look very different, I think, if you didn't raise rates. We're always trying to, you know, work our way between sort of the two – the two problems we face. One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target. Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat. So we're – that's happened through history, we don't see any signs of that now, but we're always trying to navigate between those two shoals and we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously. Q: Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. The Fed has recently been saying that financial stability risks are moderate. What kind of developments could prompt a change in that assessment to elevated risks? And is there an argument for moving the countercyclical capital buffer even when risks are moderate rather than waiting until the risks are seen as elevated, which arguably could be too late? Thanks. MR. POWELL: So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importance of the stability of the financial system. And so we – since the financial crisis, as you're aware, we've had a major focus on building up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial stability issues. We've also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system through higher capital and better regulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that which are meant to strengthen the financial system. We've done many of those things, and we feel that the financial system's in a much better place. As we look at – as we look at conditions most recently – and this was at our last meeting and it was in our – in our minutes for the last meeting – quarterly, we have a briefing at the FOMC and also at the board of the staff's views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate. If you dig into the different aspects of that question, households' balance sheets are in good shape, you know, employment is high, wages are rising, that sort of thing. The banking system, as I mentioned, has, you know, much higher capital, much higher liquidity, is much stronger. If you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historical – upper reach of their historical ranges. And then, if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you get – there is the story of leverage there. So it's not that there aren't any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate. Now, you asked about the countercyclical capital buffer. The countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our tool kit I think, finally, back in 2016. We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal. We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we revisited it was, I think, last year – sometime last year, and concluded that the test was not met. As I mentioned at the last briefing, the – you know, the assessment was that vulnerabilities were moderate. But it remains a kit – a tool for our tool kit that we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate. Q: Do you see the chances of needing to deploy it as increased? MR. POWELL: As I said, I think I'm in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate. I think the financial system – I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues. I don't see that in troubling amounts at this point. But, you know, I think it's appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully. Q: Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press. The researchers at the European Central Bank this week put out a paper saying that the impact of a trade war on the U.S. could be dire, that the U.S. economy could drop by 2 percent in the first year after a widespread trade war. Could you talk about the discussion you had? Your policy statement doesn't mention the trade tensions. You did not mention them. Do you – what kind of outlook do you have right now for the trade war? MR. POWELL: Sure. So I guess I need to start by saying that we're not responsible for trade policy and we don't comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing. But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the reserve banks largely, and we have been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials cost increases, and loss of markets, and things like that. So we've been hearing quite a lot of that, and we – the reserve bank presidents talk about it in the meeting and it goes in the minutes. So we – you know, that's – we're very transparent about hearing all of that. I think if you look at the aggregate – the performance of the U.S. economy at an aggregate, at a national level, it's hard to see much happening at this point. Or you can look at it the other way. You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been announced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate level, and they're still relatively small. You know, we worry about a couple of things. One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment. Again, we don't really see effects that we can measure yet. Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to unexpected trade developments. More than anything, though, I would worry in the longer run where this is going. You know, if the – if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good. You know, I think trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes. And, you know, fair trade – fair trade under internationally accepted rules – can be a good thing. I think if this – perhaps inadvertently – goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time, a more protectionist world, that's going to be bad for the United States economy and for American workers and families, and also for other economies. Q: Hi. Heather Long from the Washington Post. This is the third time this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecast. I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what's causing that rise and whether you see supply side effects coming through from the fiscal policy, fiscal stimulus yet. Thanks. MR. POWELL: So it's true. This year has – we've kept raising our forecast for this year. As the year's gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that's a really good thing. And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and there's good reason to expect that to continue. You ask why. You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy changes, the tax cuts, and the spending increases. That's got to be part of the story. Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling forth more investment in the oil patch. But, you know, the growth picture is very much supported by very high readings of household confidence, business confidence. So it's a pretty particularly bright moment, I think. If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy. Q: The supply-side effect? MR. POWELL: Oh, supply-side effects, yeah. So, you know, we hope they're huge, frankly. You know, the idea is you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly – and allow faster expensing for investment. The idea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes. So the effects are very uncertain. You know, the literature, there's no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are. And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects. The supply-side effects are probably both more uncertain and they're probably slower to come in. But, you know, as I said, I certainly hope that we'll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well. Q: Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. Taking a page from your risk-management approach in Jackson Hole, Mr. Chairman, I'm wondering if you can talk about what risks would make the committee – plausible risk – go faster in 2019. What risks would make them go slower? If you could talk about scenarios. And then I'd like to ask, do you see yourself as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, possibly cutting rates to soft land the economy? I know the forecast doesn't show that, but I'm curious how you soft land without doing that. MR. POWELL: OK. So I think I mentioned in the opening remarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower. You know, the main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker would be if inflation surprises to the upside. We don't see that. We really don't see that. It's not in our forecast. So I regard that as a risk. I think either significant and lasting correction in financial markets, or a slowing down in the economy that's inconsistent with our forecast – those are the kinds of things we'd react to. In terms of what – you know, what we would do. You know, I think we're always going to be adjusting monetary policy to – in light of conditions on the ground. So if the economy's weakening, then it's very possible we'd be cutting rates and, you know, vice versa. So I can't rule that out. I think it's quite difficult, though, to know what the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be in 2020. It's difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what the effects will be that far out. So we have to make estimates, but we know that they're highly uncertain. Q: Hi, Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you, chairman. The unemployment rate's now 3.9 percent. The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent over the past 12 months. Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady. With the amount of job vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this year, where is the point at which we're actually above the natural rate of unemployment and the Federal Reserve should re-examine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward, so not to cool an expanding economy? MR. POWELL: You mean where is the point at which unemployment is too low? Q: Right, exactly. MR. POWELL: Yeah, yeah. You know, so we've been – I think the labor-force participation has surprised us on the upside. There is a long-run trend there and we've now had basically five flat years. If you look – if you look at labor-force participation since the fourth quarter of '13 to now, you really have kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a – of a significant downward trend thanks to aging and other factors. That's a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation. So that's really – that's really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs. So that's a great thing. And it – and it – and it – by the way, it's a signal. It's one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further. And it's a – it's a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate. So it's a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force. And, you know, we don't know how long it can continue. We have models and we look at this – we look at this question all the time. And, you know, admittedly, we've been surprised on the – on the positive side here, so we're open to the idea that that may continue or not. Q: Hi, Jerome. Donna Borak with CNN. Just to follow up on the tariff question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariffs so far haven't quite materialized. Those weren't your words verbatim. But Walmart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy's have all said that they expect the tariffs to affect the prices of everyday consumer goods. So my question is, should there be an effect, when you expect to see that? And at what point do you start to become worried that it's actually going to affect consumer spending and dampening economic growth? MR. POWELL: It's a concern; it's a risk. You know, so you could see prices moving up. We don't see it yet, but you could see retail prices moving up. The tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they've been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices, where raising prices is really difficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet. This could provide, you know, a way for – again, we don't see it in the numbers. And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it's hard to say how one would react. And the other question would be, if you're just talking about the effect on inflation, is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward? And that's a real – that's an important question in how we would think about the appropriate response. Q: But is there a sense of timing in terms of when you might see that kick in, the effect of? MR. POWELL: I don't see it yet. You know, don't see it yet. But we – you're hearing – I mean, broadly across the economy, it's not just tariffs. You're hearing, we're hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries. We're hearing, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that. But we're not seeing it. We're seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we're not seeing it yet and, you know, we just aren't. And we're watching very carefully. Q: Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television. Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measures that track that. The flow of funds shows a decline in short-term borrowing other than in Treasurys. So I'm wondering if that suggests a change in the way Fed tightening affects the economy. And along those lines, you mentioned that – you dropped the word accommodative doesn't suggest a change in policy. But if you're dropping forward guidance in terms of accommodative, does the dot plot really serve any purpose anymore if, as you say, you can't be confident out to 2021 what's going to happen with the economy? MR. POWELL: A couple of questions in there. So the dot plot, I mean, it's not new, I don't think it's a new point that forecasts two and three years out – two or three years out are fairly uncertain. The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy. We don't vote on that, these are individual forecasts. I think market participants generally find that interesting information, so it seems to me to be serving a purpose. I think the point with accommodative was that its useful life was over. You know, we put that in the statement in 2015 just when we lifted off and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren't trying to slow down the economy, but in fact we were still – interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity. Well, that – you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn't really say anything that's important to the way the committee is thinking about policy going forward. That's why that came out. Did I get – did get all of your – Q: The idea that financial conditions remain loose, even though you've raised rates 200 basis. MR. POWELL: Yeah. Yeah, you know, it's – if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that's pretty much the answer you'll get. We don't control that. And as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do. And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so by definition we're taking them into account. But if you look at – look at interest rates, you know. Interest rates – look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term interest rates this year, very significant increases. And, you know, with your long and variable lags, that should be – that should be having an effect over time. Q: Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. So Nellie Liang was just put forward by President Donald Trump to the Fed board. And I'm just curious, you know, given that she's a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could speak to what role you played in, you know, recommending candidates to the president, giving input on who he should nominate? And then also, if I – if I may follow up on the financial stability discussion from earlier, you know, you've mentioned before that corporate debt is at high levels. And I was curious whether, you know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on leveraged lending by making that guidance less of a – less of a cudgel, I guess, while – at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam. MR. POWELL: OK. So, in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the president. And traditionally, the Fed chair has been consulted on those, and I'm happy to say that that has continued. But these are – these are really decisions for the White House and, you know, we are – think of us as just being consulted. I will say that I'm very happy and excited about the team that we're putting together, and I'm very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled. It's been pretty quiet, more – quieter than usual, which is saying something, on the board hall. So we're looking forward to getting some people confirmed. In terms of corporate debt, so this is a – this is a – you know, I was an investor for a long time, and in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending market. So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that. That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis. And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to. They're essentially in the – in the business of distributing these loans and bonds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet to a much greater degree. But it's also true – and there's significant research on this – that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy if there's overheating and that kind of thing in those markets. So we monitor that carefully. You know, the guidance isn't binding, as you pointed out. The leveraged lending isn't binding, and that's just the – that's just the way that the law is interpreted. So it's something we're monitoring. And as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate. Q: Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. If I can come back to accommodative, do you think of policy as accommodative as present? How close are you to neutrality? And do you share the view of some of your colleagues that you'll eventually need to be restrictive? MR. POWELL: OK. So are we accommodative now? So I think if you look at the – look at the dot plot and the [Fed's summary of economic projections], you'll see that the federal-funds rate even after today's move is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that – who submits an estimate of that. So that's why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it's perfectly clear that there can't be a signal because, you know, by definition that means an accommodative policy. So it wasn't because policy's not accommodative; it is still accommodative. The thinking was more – as I mentioned, it's more that the language has run its useful life. There's another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don't want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where accommodative stops or suggest that that's a really important point in our thinking. You know, what we're going to be doing, assuming we stay on this path, is we're going to be carefully monitoring incoming data from the financial markets and from the economy and asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieve: you know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices. That's the way we're thinking about it. That does kind of amount to thinking less about one's precise point estimate of the neutral rate. So that's how I think about that. Q: Well, the second question is just do you think you're going to end up in a restrictive posture?[Fed] Governor [Lael] Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you will need to do that. Do you agree with her? MR. POWELL: It's possible. It's very possible. It happens often and, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down and they've written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn't have a big effect on the economy. You know, I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens. It depends on if we keep going – you can think of it in different ways. Maybe we've underestimated the neutral rate, maybe we'll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we'll just go to that, or maybe we'll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it. I think it's very possible. But, I mean, ultimately, it isn't really the question we're answering. The question we're answering is how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support – not too much, not too little – to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals. Q: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. The 10-year anniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month. I was wondering if you thought there were any lessons from the crisis that you want to share, and two points on that. You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress. Now, [former Treasury] Secretary [Hank] Paulson and Mr. [Timothy] Geithner [former New York Fed president and former Treasury secretary] and [former Fed] Chair [Ben] Bernanke have said that Congress made a mistake when it took away the Fed's emergency powers in Dodd-Frank. And then one other thing is that are you confident that all these nonbanks didn't – you know, nonbanks never got put into the – you know, the [Financial Stability Oversight Council], you know, system. So are you confident that you can see the risks in the financial system? Thank you. MR. POWELL: So three things there. The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the – as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system. So I think if you look – if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that's what was missing and I think it's not missing anymore. So we – you know, we've put a tremendous focus on that. We raised capital, liquidity. We have stress tests, which force banks to understand – the largest banks, particularly – to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that's at least as bad as the financial crisis. And if all that doesn't work, we've got resolution plans which we've – you know, through many cycles have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely. So we've done a lot. Nobody's – you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we solved every problem and, you know, now we're going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to make – trying to keep at it. So I think those are the really important lessons and, you know, we were determined not to – you know, not to forget them. And that's – I think a risk now is to forget things that we – that we learned – that's just human nature – over time. I saw the article you're talking about. The question is, did Congress take things away – emergency powers from the Fed? So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under 13 – Section 13(3) to provide support to individual nonbanks, which is really holding companies and other companies. In exchange for that we got orderly liquidation authority and a resolution authority. Was it a mistake? I don't think there's any sense that Congresses would seriously look at changing that. I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools. I think you put them away and you hope you never need them again but – and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools. You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power so it's a really important power. In my mind, it should be used – my thinking it should be used sparingly and that means, you know, in situations where you have – I mean, in principle you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that's not a bank and it could be very threatening or it could be capable of creating systemic risk, and so I think it's a critical power to have. But, again, I would use it – I would tend to use it fairly sparingly. Q: Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Are you worried about the effect of rising interest rates on consumers? Credit-card rates have jumped to more than 17 percent since the Fed started raising interest rates. Mortgage rates are up. What do you say to consumers? MR. POWELL: Yeah. We look – of course, we look at that very carefully. And interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates. They're still quite low by historical levels. And the other thing I'll say is take – if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis. So you're right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it's going up from what were extraordinarily low levels. And it is something that we watch carefully. You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through which interest rates work. And so we do monitor the effects. Q: Hi. Hannah Lang, American Banker. [The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's] decision to go at [Community Reinvestment Act] loans suggests that there's some sort of disagreement among how to proceed with the joint plan. What are the issues that are preventing the joint plan from developing? And how close are you to a possible joint plan? MR. POWELL: Well, at the Fed we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve. And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology, particularly, and changes in the nature of banking, that it's an appropriate time – it's past an appropriate time. It now is certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA. But we don't want to lose that focus on community. And, you know, we definitely want to see the fundamental purpose of the law sustained. Many of the issues that we had were reflected in the OCC's [advance notice of proposed rulemaking]. And we're hopeful that over time there will be a joint proposed rulemaking with the OCC, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.] and the Fed. It's a process. And, you know, we're very much interested in continuing to push it forward. Q: Steve Beckner, freelance journalist, filing for NPR. Mr. Chairman, following up on the neutral-rate issue – and you touched on this – you and your colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral funds rate estimate, to 3 percent. But that's still, I believe, like, 125 basis points below where it was six years ago. What are the odds that productivity – you know, investment, productivity, labor market, and other developments could further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the projected funds-rate levels less restrictive than they now seem? MR. POWELL: So in principle the historic variables – the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment – don't move quickly. They move very gradually. They're pinned down by longer-run forces like demographics. In the case of the funds rate, it's productivity. It's appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things too. So they move quite slowly through time. I think we all look at them, those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a change every quarter, but every now and again make a change. And you're right. We actually – the median ticked up a tenth. It's a tenth we're talking about here. So but still I think it's a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of a longer-run neutral rate, and potentially the longer-run growth rate – who knows – and maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend. It's just that you change those estimates over time. They're informed by incoming data. They don't change a lot, though, although they did – it's interesting that the neutral rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many different models, and it's been slow to recover. I don't expect a dramatic recovery there. But, you know, we – we're so bad at forecasting productivity, it's just very hard to know when productivity is going to arrive and in what quantity. So I think we have to be humble about how little we really know about where these starred variables either are or are going. Q: Hi, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thank you for taking the question. I'd like to just kind of ask again – you mentioned earlier that gradual – a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react. But specifically, what are you going to be looking to see? Because you also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag. So any kind of specific signposts that maybe we've reached the end of the tightening cycle or where we should stop? Secondly, if you worry about the divergence between interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a time when emerging markets are under pressure. Thanks. MR. POWELL: Sure. So, you know, some of the things that we'd be looking at to tell us whether we're getting close to supply-side limits would be, first, does job growth slow down? A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know. An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you're reaching those points. You know, if headline growth slowed down, that's another one. So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration. I think also, though, we've seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it's a broad and significant tightening. So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things. So in terms of divergence, yes, so the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, healthy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned. And we've seen growth abroad, but growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed down a little bit. And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stronger, then that's just part of the context, part of the environment that could mean a higher dollar, it could be – it could therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies. That's the way the integrated international economy works. So you could see that and, you know, it's just – it's just all of the – all things that go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy. I would say, you know, we're not responsible for the dollar. Of course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dollar. But the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017. It's moved up off its lows, but it's not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin. Q: Hi. Jean Yung with Market News International. Can you give us an update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary policy that the Fed made earlier this year when it decoupled the interest on excess reserves rate from the upper bound of the target range? And have you been happy with that adjustment? And do you see the need to make another such adjustment in the near future? MR. POWELL: So we've said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal-funds rate trades within the target range. And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then – and then at the bottom end a reverse repo facility. So we – in June when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25 and that moved federal-funds sort of back into the range. It worked and it was successful. The federal-funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range. We may – we may do that again. You know, we, again, we have our tools and we will use them. We think it's principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasurys supply, which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well. So we don't see it as a – as a – as a big problem. We see it as a problem we can address with our tools and we'll use them if we have to. Q: Hi, Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Last month, the [White House's Council of Economic Advisers] outlined a different way to calculate wage growth. Has the Fed looked at that at all? And what are you seeing in terms of non-wage-based compensation? MR. POWELL: So I wouldn't comment on a CEA paper. And I would imagine they probably wouldn't comment on our stuff either. But I would just say this. So I am familiar with the – with the question and the work. You know, we look – we look at a range of indicators of wages and I think the broader the better. You really – a perfect – a perfect wage measure would also include benefits because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages. So I think it's right to choose those broader ones. But they're kind of all telling the same story right now. If you look at the principal four that we look at, we look at a whole range of wage and benefit cost indicators. They are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right clustered around 3 percent. That's a full percentage point higher than it was five years ago. That's a good thing. Then the question – the other question is, what about inflation? You know, if you're looking for real wage increases, you've got to ask inflation. And there you have to pick an inflation measure. Some people pick [the consumer-price index]. We, of course, pick personal-consumption expenditures because we think it's a little better measure, it's a little broader. And it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that's not why we pick it. We just think it's more accurate. And the trend there is running around 2 percent. So if wages are running at – wages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and inflation running at around 2 percent, PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent, PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see the – you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices, probably, and we expect inflation go to back down to 2 percent. So we think of that as 2 percent. That's how we think about it. I hope that helps. Q: Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance. Chair Powell, I want to follow up on something you said, actually, at Jackson Hole. You were talking about longer-term structural challenges for the economy and you mentioned that adjusting the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. I'm just wondering if you can, you know, maybe expand on your thoughts there, and if this is an issue that comes up among members of the FOMC at all. MR. POWELL: So it doesn't really come up. It's not really our job. And we do – we do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing. We don't have responsibility for fiscal policy. But in the longer run, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy. So for that reason, I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy, but they've commented on – at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular – you know, particular measures. And so – and I – my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane. And, you know, so I would just say it's no secret it's been true for a long time that with the – with our uniquely expensive health care delivery system and the aging of our population, we've been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time. And there's no hiding from it; in the end, we will have to face that. And I think, you know, the sooner the better. And also, these are good times. These are – you know, this is – this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range, in the neighborhood of full employment. Interest rates are low. It's a good time to be addressing these things. So I just – I put that out there and leave it at that. Q: I'm Takesh Khan (ph) with – (inaudible) – newspaper. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to ask about emerging market. What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emerging market, especially currency depression or capital – the flow from the emerging countries? And do you think there is a possibility to stop the interest-rate hike due to emerging market turmoil – due to turmoil of emerging market? MR. POWELL: Sorry, the second question was? Q: There is a possibly to stop the interest-rate hike. MR. POWELL: Oh, to stop, OK. All right. Well, we serve a domestic mandate which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices...[and] the performance of the emerging market economies, really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate. I'd also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy where Americans are buying things and the economy is growing and our – you know, that's going to support demand all around the globe. So that's a good thing. Now, we do understand, though, that when we – when our economy is strong and we're raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have significant external dollar borrowing. And what we try to do is be very transparent about what we're doing and why, and we have been I believe, and we've also moved quite gradually. So I – you know, I think we've been performing well on that front. There are some countries that are – that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, and – but not most emerging market countries. It's a relatively small number. And those particular countries have – you know, have particular vulnerabilities which are well known in the form of budget deficits and significant external dollar borrowings and high inflation and things like that. So, again, well continue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we possibly can. And that's really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth. I'll just – I think that answers both your questions, actually. Q: Jeannie Monte (sp) with Agence France-Presse. You mentioned earlier a possible, not probable, correction. And I want to come back to the high level of the stock market. Are there any participants to the FOMC who think that we are witnessing an episode of irrational exuberance or rational exuberance? And if there was a steep correction, would it provoke financial stability concerns? MR. POWELL: So I don't comment on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices. I can say that, by some valuation measures, they're in the upper range of their historical value ranges. But, you know, I wouldn't want to – I wouldn't want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be. You know, we would look very carefully at the nature of it. And, I mean, really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value. So that's a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values falling. We know that that's a really bad situation. A simple drop in equity prices is – all by itself doesn't really have those features. It could certainly feature – it could certainly affect consumption and have a negative effect on the economy, though. Q: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with BankRate.com. One thing that's changed since the crisis is the majority of mortgages issued last year came from so-called nonbank lenders, as traditional banks scaled back. What confidence do you have about supervision, and I suppose also regulation in this space, given the role of housing finance in the crisis? Thank you. MR. POWELL: It's a good question. So you're right that a lot of mortgages now originate outside the system. Many of those, though, have to meet certain basic standards to be bought by the [government-sponsored enterprises]. I think we – if we look at mortgage credit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit, good credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history. You know, it's – have we set – have we got that exactly right? I don't know. I mean, I – but that's clearly – that's the reality. In terms of those institutions, they do have supervision by the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] and other state regulators. But you're right. They're – much of the origination process has moved outside the banking system. It's something we monitor.

Thank Goodness * Heard on the Street: Accommodative or Not, Rates Are Going Up * Parsing the Fed: How the September Statement Changed From August * Recap: Powell Press Conference",WSJ Pro Central Banking
2018-09-27 17:52:00,"The Fed Isn't the Supreme Court. Thank Goodness; In a charged partisan environment in Washington, the central bank remains for now an apolitical island","While many Americans are riveted on the Supreme Court this week, they might have missed an action by another federal institution that will affect almost every household. That the Federal Reserve's \b interest rate\b0  increase drew relatively little attention is a good thing. As American institutions from the courts to law enforcement have become partisan battlegrounds, the central bank for now is an island of dull, apolitical competence. A few years ago, this didn't seem likely. The Fed emerged from the financial crisis under attack from the left for bailing out bankers and from the right for unconventional policies to hold down interest rates and stimulate spending. As a candidate, Donald Trump joined in with his own attacks. As president, he had an unprecedented opportunity to appoint bomb throwers or partisan loyalists to the top positions at the central bank, including chairman and vice chairman. He didn't. He has nominated mainstream, qualified candidates who have mostly drawn praise from outside economists and Fed watchers. It isn't a guarantee the Fed won't err—by raising interest rates too slowly or too quickly—but it provides essential stability to the economy's most important institution. It helped that the partisan activists who care deeply about the judiciary, law enforcement, the environment and immigration were less invested in the Fed. Some Republican legislators did believe former Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her predecessors had kept interest rates too low and lobbied for John Taylor, a Stanford University economist, to succeed her. But Mr. Trump actually liked Ms. Yellen; he just wanted her policies carried out by his own appointee. Stephen Moore, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation who advised the president to select Mr. Taylor, says, ""Trump was worried that Taylor would be too hawkish on inflation."" Instead, Mr. Trump nominated Jerome Powell, a Republican previously appointed to the Fed by Barack Obama and championed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Trump seems surprised Mr. Powell has continued raising interest rates. ""I'm worried about the fact that they seem to like rising interest rates,"" he said Wednesday. ""We can do other things with the money."" Despite his public grumbling, Mr. Trump hasn't pressured Mr. Powell by nominating loyalists to vacancies on the Fed's board of governors. The search process for Fed candidates began soon after Mr. Trump took office and was coordinated by Andrew Olmem, a former Capitol Hill staffer who is now deputy director of the National Economic Council. The result has been a slate of governors with complementary backgrounds in monetary policy, bank regulation, management and financial market stability. Three—Richard Clarida, a monetary economist; Randal Quarles, a banking lawyer; and Michelle Bowman, Kansas' banking commissioner—are Republicans. Nonetheless, all were backed by some Democratic senators. Last week Mr. Trump nominated Nellie Liang, a former Fed staffer specializing in financial stability, for the board's last vacancy. Some Republicans wonder if Ms. Liang, a registered Democrat, may be too fond of regulation. But she has drawn praise from conservatives, such as at the Manhattan Institute, a think tank. It is too soon to judge the impact of Mr. Trump's appointees. And controversy is inevitable, over both interest rates and regulation. Democrats criticized the Fed's decision to offer Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley a pass on recent ""stress tests"" (though Lael Brainard, the only remaining Obama appointee on the board, backed the move.) But the Fed has moved more gradually to ease rules than Trump appointees at some other financial regulators. Fed officials have also been helped by the central bank's deeply ingrained tradition of nonpartisanship. Republican legislators often criticized Ms. Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke; they didn't fire back, but nor did they change course. Mr. Powell has done the same, refusing to wade into charged topics such as tariffs and tax cuts except insofar as they affect the Fed's job. The Fed's culture has a way of absorbing newcomers. While federal judges bring their own clerks and cabinet secretaries their undersecretaries, Fed chiefs come alone. Their advisers and secretaries are drawn from the existing central bank staff, which reinforces continuity (and group think, say critics). Mr. Powell has recruited Johns Hopkins University academic Jon Faust as an adviser, but they got to know each other when Mr. Faust served on the Fed staff. That staff is itself relatively diverse ideologically; Ms. Yellen, once chairwoman of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, was once a staffer, as was Kevin Hassett, now chairman of Mr. Trump's CEA. In its approach to policy, however, the Fed is rather homogenous. ""We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence,"" Mr. Powell said Wednesday. ""We don't consider political factors or things like that, and so that's who we are, that's what we do, and that's just the way it's always going to be for us.""

2018-09-27 17:57:00,US mortgage rates up; 30-year at 7-year high 4.72 percent,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates are up for the fifth straight week, with the key 30-year rate reaching its highest level in more than seven years. Costs for would-be homebuyers continue to climb. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 4.72 percent from 4.65 percent last week. The average benchmark rate has risen from 3.83 percent a year ago. The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans increased to 4.16 percent this week from 4.11 percent last week. The Federal Reserve signaled its confidence in the economy on Wednesday by raising a key interest rate for a third time this year, forecasting another rate hike before year's end. The strong economy and anticipation of more short-term rate hikes by the Fed are helping drive the increase in mortgage rates. Economists believe the country is on track for annual growth this year of around 3 percent. That would be the best performance since 2005, three years before the 2008 financial crisis pushed the U.S. into the worst recession since the 1930s. To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. The average fee on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was unchanged from last week at 0.5 point. The fee on 15-year mortgages also remained at 0.5 point. The average rate for five-year adjustable-rate mortgages rose to 3.97 percent from 3.92 percent last week. The fee slipped to 0.3 point from 0.4 point.

2018-09-27 16:55:00,"Fed Raises Rates; Indonesia, Philippines Follow; Suit Could Complicate Fed Rate Policy; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Wednesday, September 27, 2018","The ‘Dot Plot' Reveals Two Policy Directions By Nick Timiraos It's generally a mistake to obsess over the interest-rate projections—the so-called dot plot—in the out-years of the Federal Reserve's quarterly economic projections. Nevertheless, the projections released Wednesday highlight two different directions policy could move after next year. Most Fed officials see the central bank raising rates by another percentage point through next year. The question then turns on what happens after that, when rates will be well within the range officials currently estimate is likely to prevail over the long run. Looking ahead to 2020, the median projection shows just one more rate increase, to a range between 3.25% and 3.5%. Look closer, and there are only two officials who project such a level of interest rates. Rather, there's a cluster of seven officials who expect the Fed will need to raise rates above 3.5% and another cluster that says rates shouldn't need to rise beyond 3.25%. The split likely reflects different opinions over how inflation is likely to behave. Wednesday's projections show all officials see inflation holding between 2% and 2.3% over the next three years. The dot plot shows, however, that officials expect a different rate will be needed to keep inflation at that range. The strength of the Phillips curve could largely determine which of the two camps prevails. The first camp says so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level they project is consistent with low and stable inflation, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion. Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials say if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth, even if unemployment remains at very low levels. Mr. Powell didn't say where he stood on Wednesday, but he continued to voice some uncertainty over the traditional models that have animated the Fed's thinking. ""Let's just admit that the inflation process has changed, dramatically, from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It's in a good place now,"" he said. Officials will be ""watching carefully,"" he said. ""If inflation reacts more strongly, or more weakly, to the strong economy, then we'll adjust policy appropriately."" Fed Raises Interest Rates, Signals One More Increase This Year The Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates by another quarter-percentage point, and officials signaled they expected to lift them again later this year and through 2019 to keep a strong economy on an even keel. Officials voted unanimously Wednesday on the increase, which will bring the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%. Most Fed officials expected to raise rates one more time this year, according to new projections released after the meeting. ""Our economy is strong,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a news conference. How the September Statement Changed From August Analysis: Powell Says It Was Perfect Time to Strike ‘Accommodative' Heard on the Street: Accommodative or Not, Rates Are Going Up Bank Suit Could Complicate the Fed's Rate Policy A lawsuit against the New York Fedcould complicate the central bank's effort to control short-term interest rates at a time when investor scrutiny of those markets is intensifying.

Mexico's President-Elect to Nominate Economist to Central Bank Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador intends to nominate well-known independent economist Jonathan Heath to the Bank of Mexico's board of governors in his first central bank appointment, according to people with knowledge of the plan. Czech Central Bank Raises Rates Again The Czech National Bankraised its key \b interest rate\b0  for the sixth time in just over a year, cementing its position as the most dynamic of Europe's central banks in charting a path back toward policy settings that were considered normal before the global financial crisis. Bank Indonesia Hikes for Fifth Time Since May Bank Indonesiaraised interest rates for the fifth time since May, and said it would introduce trade in domestic non-deliverable forwards for the rupiah to reduce exchange-rate volatility. The central bank raised the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75%. New Zealand Central Bank Keeps Rates On Ice New Zealand's central bankleft its benchmark \b interest rate\b0  unchanged while continuing to leave its options open for the future, saying the next move could be up or down. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand held its benchmark official cash rate at 1.75% as expected by economists, a level it has been maintained at for nearly two years. Philippines Central Bank Raises Interest Rates The Philippine central bankraised overnight interest rates, as expected, citing rising inflation. The central bank's benchmark lending rate was raised to 5.0% from 4.5%, while the borrowing rate is now at 4.5% from 4.0%. All 11 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a rate increase.

The Fed should be careful not to undercut this trend before it has a chance to affect women throughout the job market.""

The social dynamics underlying this movement are of course complex. But if one of the factors preventing women from speaking out was fear of losing their job or damaging their career, then a robust labor market can help.

""The Fed's message of continued tightening suggests it remains too soon to look for a resumption of trend dollar weakness."" The 'Goldilocks' scenario of U.S. Federal Reserveinterest rate increases and rising global growth is likely to continue for longer, although the Fed is expected to raise rates only twice next year, says BNP Paribas. Still, ""the fiscal hangover, trade wars, and tighter monetary policy could restrain growth in 2019 by more than the Fed expects, resulting in an earlier pause in the hiking cycle than its forecast.""

Though the meeting offered few surprises, its passage removed a risk overhanging the market, encouraging buyers to step off the sidelines. Adding to this dynamic is the approaching end to the third quarter, which could prompt investors to add more Treasurys to de-risk their portfolios.

""It could change the U.K. from a developed country to an emerging market country overnight,"" he says. As seen with Turkey and Argentina recently, emerging-market economies can be forced to raise interest rates to stem sharp falls in their currencies or assets, despite this harming the economy. Mr. Cook said the Bank of England would likely cut rates after a no-deal Brexit to mitigate economic damage, but steep sterling falls could necessitate rate rises.

2018-09-27 00:00:00,"Fed Increases Interest Rates, Signals One More Bump in '18","The Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates by another quarter-percentage point, and central-bank officials signaled they expected to lift them again later this year and through 2019 to keep a strong economy on an even keel. The policy makers voted unanimously Wednesday to lift their benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%. Most Fed officials expected to raise rates one more time this year, according to new projections released after the conclusion of their two-day rate-setting meeting. The increase, which drew a rebuke from President Trump, is the third this year and the eighth since the Fed began to lift rates in late 2015 after keeping them pinned close to zero after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed's action marks the first time it has lifted its benchmark rate above 2% since 2008. It also is the first time in a decade the fed-funds rate will rise above inflation, measured by the Fed's preferred gauge, which excludes volatile energy and food categories. So-called core prices rose 2% in July. ""These rates remain low,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference. ""This gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans."" Mr. Trump, at a news conference later Wednesday, said he was ""not happy"" about the Fed raising rates. But he said, ""They are raising them because we are doing so well."" And he said higher rates weren't all bad because they could help people who rely on interest savings for income. Mr. Powell said the central bank decision was guided by economic theory and evidence -- not politics: ""That's who we are. That's what we do. And that's just the way it's always going to be for us,"" he said. Stocks erased gains and closed lower Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 3.059% from 3.102%. Yields fall as bond prices rise, and Treasury yields are near their highest levels in seven years. The Fed's actions ripple through the economy over time by raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Rising mortgage rates appear to have contributed to a somewhat slower pace of home sales this year. Even if the Fed raises its benchmark rate to 3% next year, ""we don't think that's a hindrance to the economy,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank in Columbus, Ohio. ""We don't see that lifting mortgage rates substantially. We don't see that as a threat to credit line borrowing."" The big question now is how much higher officials think they need to raise rates to keep the economy from overheating. The Fed targets a 2% inflation rate, which it sees as a sign of healthy demand. It wants to avoid economic growth that becomes unsustainable, leading to a boom and then bust. Projections released after Wednesday's meeting show that most Fed officials expect they will raise rates by 1 percentage point through next year, and most officials penciled in at least one more quarter-point increase for 2020. That would leave the benchmark rate slightly higher than 3.25%. Because this is modestly above the so-called neutral rate most officials project is required to balance supply and demand over the long run, such a setting would deliberately restrict growth. Mr. Powell has stressed the uncertainty of estimating this neutral setting. To that end, the Fed dropped from its postmeeting statement on Wednesday a sentence that for years had described its rate stance as ""accommodative,"" meaning officials were pressing on the gas pedal to spur more growth. Economic projections released after the meeting envision an unusually favorable set of conditions in which the unemployment rate holds below 4% over the next three years but inflation never rises far beyond the Fed's 2% target. Whether the Fed realizes this ""Goldilocks"" economy that is neither too hot nor too cold could depend on whether inflation behaves as expected. The risk that inflation climbs higher and faster than anticipated could require the Fed to raise rates ""a little bit quicker,"" Mr. Powell said. He quickly added, ""We don't see that. We really don't see that."" Wednesday's interest-rate projections show two different schools of thought about how the Fed might proceed. One camp of officials said so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level they project is consistent with low and stable inflation, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion. Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials have said if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth. The Fed's projection that the economy could stay in a sweet spot for years also depends on forces outside of its control, including trade policy.

2018-09-27 12:27:00,TEXT-Indonesia c.bank raises rates a 5th time since mid-May,"JAKARTA, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank lifted its benchmark interest rate for the fifth time since mid-May on Thursday, hours after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in the United States. Here is the official translation of Bank Indonesia's statement. The original was in Indonesian: The BI Board of Governors agreed on 26th and 27th September 2018 to raise the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate by 25 bps to 5.75 percent, while also raising the Deposit Facility (DF) and Lending Facility (LF) rates by 25 bps to 5.00 percent and 6.50 percent respectively. The decision is consistent with ongoing efforts to lower the current account deficit within a manageable threshold while maintaining the attractiveness of the domestic financial markets, thus further strengthens Indonesia's external resilience despite widespread global uncertainty. The Government's seriousness and concrete measures, with Bank Indonesia, to stimulate exports and reduce imports is expected to lower the current account deficit, specifically in 2019, to around 2.5 percent of GDP. Furthermore, Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen coordination with the Government and other relevant authorities to maintain economic stability and bolster external resilience. Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will monitor prevailing economic developments, such as the current account deficit, exchange rates, financial system stability and inflation, as follow-up measures to maintain macroeconomic and financial system stability. To strengthen the Rupiah stability, the policy rate hike is also supported by policies to implement Domestic Non-Deliverable Forwards (DNDF) transactions in order to accelerate forex market deepening while providing alternate hedging instrument for banks and corporations. DNDF transaction is a forward transaction with netting settlement in the domestic forex market, using Rupiah. The reference rates are JISDOR for USD against IDR and Bank Indonesia FX Transaction Midrate for for non-USD against IDR. DNDF transactions can be done by banks with customers and foreign parties to hedge foreign exchange risks, and must be supported by an underlying transaction in the form of trade in goods and services, investment, and bank loans in foreign currency. Global economic growth becomes further uneven, accompanied by persistent global financial market uncertainty. The U.S. economy has maintained pace on the back of faster consumption and investment growth, combined with rising inflation. In line with expectations, The Fed raised the FFR policy rate by 25bps as part of its monetary policy normalization. Meanwhile, economic growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs) and Europe is estimated to be weaker-than-expected. Economic moderation is even expected for Japan and China. The uneven global economic growth is unseparable from the trade tensions between the US and several countries. High uncertainty in the global financial markets also prompts investors to place their fund in safe assets, especially in the U.S. The various headwinds have triggered broad U.S. dollar appreciation and capital outflows from emerging markets, culminating in depreciatory pressures on currencies in developing countries. National economic growth in Indonesia remains in line with the previous projection, backed by domestic demand. Strong consumption data is supported by improving incomes and spending on the elections. Solid investment growth is expected to persist, bolstered by building investment in relation to infrastructure projects and property as well as non-building investment. Nevertheless, stronger export growth is expected to be restrained by weak agricultural exports despite improving manufacturing exports, boosted by the chemicals industry as well as iron and steel subsector. On the other hand, imports remain high on strong domestic demand, especially of capital goods as a corollary of increasing investment. Consequently, Bank Indonesia projects national economic growth in 2018 at 5.0-5.4 percent, increasing thereafter to 5.1-5.5 percent in 2019. Indonesia's trade balance recorded a deficit in August 2018. The trade deficit stood at $1.02 billion in the reporting period, halving from $2.01 billion the month earlier. The trade deficit stemmed from a growth surge of oil and gas imports, particularly crude oil. Meanwhile, the non-oil and gas trade balance recorded a surplus in line with fewer non-oil and gas imports, including machinery and mechanical appliances, iron and steel, vehicles and components, organic chemicals, as well as plastics and articles of plastic. Nevertheless, demand for non-oil and gas import remain high, as domestic demand remain high. Cumulatively from January-August 2018, therefore, Indonesia's trade balance recorded a $4.09 billion deficit. Consequently, the position of reserve assets stood at $117.9 billion at the end of August 2018, equivalent to 6.8 months of imports or 6.6 months of imports and servicing government external debt, which is well above the international standard of three months. The Rupiah has continued to lean against depreciatory pressures, while mitigating volatility. Rupiah depreciation is in line with the currencies of peer countries, spurred by broad US dollar appreciation. Therefore, the Rupiah depreciated by an average of 1.05 percent in August 2018 but defied pressures in September to close at a level of 14,905/USD on 26th September 2018. Year-to-date (ytd), therefore, the Rupiah has lost 8.97 percent in value against the U.S. dollar as of 26th September 2018, faring better, however, than the Indian rupee, South African rand, Brazilian real and Turkish lira. Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will continue to implement exchange rate stabilisation measures in line with the currency's fundamental value, while maintaining market mechanisms and financial market deepening efforts. Such policy is aimed to contain Rupiah volatility and liquidity adequacy in the market, to prevent risks on macroeconomic stability and financial system. Low and stable inflation has been maintained. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded 0.05 percent (mtm) deflation in August 2018, after posting 0.28 percent (mtm) inflation the month earlier. Deflation of volatile foods (VF) and administered prices (AP) was the main contributor to headline deflation in August, while the pace of core inflation slowed. Consequently, inflation recorded an annual rate of 3.20 percent (yoy), which is relatively stable compared with the 3.18 percent (yoy) recorded last month. Price pressures on volatile foods (VF) recorded deflation in the reporting period due primarily to corrections affecting several foodstuffs. Administered prices (AP) also experienced deflation because of corrections to airfares. Core inflation was controlled at 0.30 percent (mtm), falling from 0.41 percent (mtm) the month earlier. Controlled core inflation is linked to policy consistency by Bank Indonesia in terms of anchoring rational inflation expectations to the target corridor, including maintaining Rupiah exchange rates in line with the currency's fundamental value. Looking ahead, Bank Indonesia projects inflation within the target range of 3.5±1 percent in 2018. Furthermore, Bank Indonesia and the Government will constantly strengthen policy coordination to control low and stable inflation. Financial system stability has been maintained as the bank intermediation function improves and the banking industry effectively contained credit risk. Maintained financial system stability is reflected in the high Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) reported by the banking industry at 22.5 percent and the liquidity ratio of 19.8 percent in July 2018. In addition, the banking sector maintained a low level of non-performing loans (NPL) at 2.7 percent (gross) or 1.3 percent (net). Financial system stability is also contributing to improvements in the bank intermediation function. Credit growth was reported to accelerate from 10.8 percent (yoy) to 11.3 percent (yoy) in July 2018, while deposit growth was maintained at 6.9 percent (yoy) in the reporting period compared with 7.0 percent (yoy) the month earlier. On the other hand, nonbank economic financing through the financial markets, such as initial public offerings (IPO) and rights issues, corporate bonds, medium-term notes (MTN) and Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCD), reached a cumulative total of 133.2 trillion rupiah (gross) as of July 2018, which is below the 163.9 trillion rupiah recorded in the same period last year. Consequently, Bank Indonesia projects credit growth in 2018 at 10.0-12.0 percent (yoy), accelerating from the 8.2 percent (yoy) realised in 2017. Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia still predicts deposit growth to slow down from 2017 achievement of 9.4 percent (yoy), yet remain within the 8.0-10.0 percent (yoy) range. Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will continue to monitor and maintain sufficient liquidity to support financial system stability. Positive domestic economic developments are backed by a secure, efficient, available and reliable payment system and Rupiah currency management. In August 2018, the financial system operated smoothly. Furthermore, the settlement of noncash transactions as well as cash transactions increased in the reporting period as economic activity accelerated. Such dynamics were confirmed by a 9.48 percent (yoy) bump in National Clearing System (SKNBI) transactions and a 13.6 percent (yoy) increase of noncash retail payment system transactions (ATM/debit cards, credit cards and e-money). Regarding cash payments (Rupiah currency management), the position of currency in circulation surged 10.2 percent (yoy) as in line with public transaction needs and cyclical pattern.

2018-09-27 11:00:00,"WRAPUP 3-China, NZ shrug off Fed, but FX risks push Philippines and Indonesia into hikes","* Fed lifts rates, marks end of ""accommodative"" policy * BSP, BI hike rates; RBI set to tighten next week * NZ, China, Taiwan hold fire * Asian economies gravitate towards China, away from U.S. (Updates with Philippines, Indonesia rate hikes; fresh comments) By Swati Pandey and Vatsal Srivastava SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China, Taiwan and New Zealand sat tight after the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike, but Indonesia and the Philippines pulled the trigger on Thursday to prop up their battered currencies and temper risks to inflation and financial stability. In a statement that marked the end of the era of ""accommodative"" policy, Fed policymakers lifted rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 2.00-2.25 percent. The U.S. central bank foresees another hike in December, three more next year, and one in 2020. The Fed outlook is pressuring Asian currencies across the board, but not all countries need to tweak their policy. New Zealand is comfortable with a weaker kiwi as it helps its exporters. In China, a weaker yuan does raise concerns about capital outflows, but its currency is tightly managed and it also has capital control tools to mitigate financial risks. For countries that run widening trade deficits, however, weaker currencies are posing risks to inflation, growth and financial stability. ""Economies such as India and Indonesia are more exposed to outflows ... We will continue to see further depreciation in 2018 and throughout 2019, although perhaps at a slower pace,"" said Carlos Casanova, APAC economist at Coface, who expects more hikes in the two countries and Philippines. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) hiked rates by 50 bps to 4.50 percent to curb inflation and shore up the fragile peso, adding to the three hikes worth 100 bps since May. In August, inflation surged to a more than nine-year high of 6.4 percent, above the central bank's 2-4 percent comfort range. Bank Indonesia added 25 bps to its four previous hikes this year, bringing rates to 5.75 percent as expected, or 150 bps higher since May. The peso is trading around its lowest in 12 years, having shed some 8 percent against the dollar year-to-date, while the rupiah is around a two-decade low after a 9 percent plunge. Asia's worst performing currency, the rupee, which has weakened by more than 12 percent to record lows, is also likely to be a key consideration for Reserve Bank of India, which is expected to hike by 25 bps next week. All three currencies ended steady on Thursday. One potential silver lining for the Asian deficit trio may be that the Fed is underestimating the impact of its past and future hikes as well as other factors such as the trade war on the global economy, and implicitly, the recoil back home, some analysts say. Against a backdrop of slower-than-expected Fed tightening, ING Asia economist Prakash Sakpal sees 75 bps worth of hikes in Indonesia, 125 bps in Philippines and 100 bps in India by end-2019, including Thursday's increases. ""This (Fed) tightening will likely prove too much for the rest of the world,"" said Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International. ""The Fed will have to strike a more cautious tone."" The Hong Kong Monetary Authority moved in lockstep with the Fed as its currency is pegged to the greenback. GRAVITY PULL For the stronger Asian economies, which are increasingly gravitating towards China on trade and investment, and away from the United States, the Fed outlook does not move the needle as much as it did during its previous tightening cycles. South Korea's central bank Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, as well as weakness in inflation and the job market weighed against policy tightening. Taiwan left rates unchanged at 1.375 percent, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept them at 1.75 percent, where they have been for the past two years, citing tepid inflation and the risk of a trade war. Like most economies in Asia, New Zealand is now much more closely integrated with China than with the United States. Worries that China's economy is slowing and will further suffer from an intensifying trade row with Washington are therefore more relevant for most Asian economies' interest rate outlook than the strength of the U.S. economy. New Zealand now trades about twice as much with China than it does with the United States, a consequence of Beijing's staggering growth over the last two decades. When Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, triggering the global financial crisis, New Zealand traded with the United States 1.35 times more than with China. ""China’s economic outlook matters more than the U.S.,"" said Mark Wills, who develops multi-asset strategies for institutional clients at State Street Global Advisors. ASIAN EMs STRONGER China's central bank skipped open market operations on Thursday, meaning it did not immediately adjust borrowing costs for interbank loans after the Fed hike. The People's Bank of China stood pat in June, but raised rates slightly in March shortly after Fed's move. Despite the trade risks and slowing consumption, China is still seen growing at an impressive rate of around 6.5 percent this year. For Asian emerging markets, this is an advantage that they have over peers in Latin America and elsewhere. That, coupled with less worrying current account deficits and stronger economic prospects, is likely to help Asia avoid the kind of tumult that has seen Argentina hike rates to 60 percent and Turkey to 24 percent this year. ""Asian central banks have been vigilant, and pre-emptive ... in running their monetary policies,"" said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corporation. ""They gain credibility in this cycle."" (Reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney and Vatsal Srivastava in Singapore; Writing by Marius Zaharia in Hong Kong Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",Reuters News
2018-09-27 11:30:00,Timiraos's Take: The ‘Dot Plot' Reveals Two Policy Directions; A split in Fed officials' forecasts likely reflects different opinions over how inflation is likely to behave,"It's generally a mistake to obsess over the interest-rate projections—the so-called dot plot—in the out-years of the Federal Reserve's quarterly economic projections. Nevertheless, the projections released Wednesday highlight two different directions policy could move after next year. Most Fed officials see the central bank raising rates by another percentage point through next year. The question then turns on what happens after that, when rates will be well within the range officials currently estimate is likely to prevail over the long run. Looking ahead to 2020, the median projection shows just one more rate increase, to a range between 3.25% and 3.5%. Look closer, and there are only two officials who project such a level of interest rates. Rather, there's a cluster of seven officials who expect the Fed will need to raise rates above 3.5% and another cluster that says rates shouldn't need to rise beyond 3.25%. The split likely reflects different opinions over how inflation is likely to behave. Wednesday's projections show all officials see inflation holding between 2% and 2.3% over the next three years. The dot plot shows, however, that officials expect a different rate will be needed to keep inflation at that range. The strength of the Phillips curve could largely determine which of the two camps prevails. The first camp says so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level they project is consistent with low and stable inflation, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion. Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials say if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth, even if unemployment remains at very low levels. Mr. Powell didn't say where he stood on Wednesday, but he continued to voice some uncertainty over the traditional models that have animated the Fed's thinking. ""Let's just admit that the inflation process has changed, dramatically, from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It's in a good place now,"" he said. Officials will be ""watching carefully,"" he said. ""If inflation reacts more strongly, or more weakly, to the strong economy, then we'll adjust policy appropriately.""

2018-09-27 08:04:00,UPDATE 2-China leaves rates steady after Fed as two economies diverge,"(Adds PBOC adviser comment) SHANGHAI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China's central bank left short-term rates unchanged on Thursday, choosing not to follow a benchmark interest rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve despite the risk that it could that it could put renewed pressure on the yuan. The move by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) means that it did not immediately adjust borrowing costs for interbank loans after the Fed raised its key rate overnight. While the PBOC had been expected to stand pat and has not always followed the Fed in lockstep, the decision highlights diverging policy paths for the world's largest economies. China's economy is slowly losing momentum and is facing more pressure from escalating U.S. trade tariffs. The Fed, on the other hand, sees the U.S. economy growing at faster-than-expected pace this year, with only a slight slowdown in 2019. China has, in fact, been easing credit policies and trying to reduce financing costs in various ways in recent months as economic activity has softened and U.S. trade threats mount. The PBOC also said it had skipped open market operations on Thursday as liquidity levels in the banking system were ""relatively high"". It did not mention interest rates on reverse repos in a statement on the its website, but attributed ""relatively high"" liquidity levels to quarter-end fiscal expenditures, which could ""absorb factors including maturing reverse repos and government bond issuance"". Sheng Songcheng, a policy adviser to the central bank, told state-run Beijing News that raising interest rates does not fit China's current economic situation, as it needs to lower financing costs to support companies and promote steady growth. ""The Fed rate hike would pile some pressure on the yuan in the short term, but it would not be huge as China's economy was largely stable,"" Sheng was quoted as saying. China has currency and capital flow controls in place, and there remains a gap in interest rates between the China and United States, Sheng added. The PBOC had followed a Fed hike in March by bumping up its short- and medium-term rates, but held its fire in June despite U.S. tightening. MIND THE GAP? The interest rate on China's benchmark bond is about 61 basis points (bps) higher than its U.S. counterpart . In June, the gap was more than 70 bps, and any further narrowing could risk a resurgence of outflows from China. The Fed foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020. In contrast, analysts forecast more policy support measures are on the way in China in coming months, including at least one more reduction in banks' reserve requirements, other forms of liquidity injections and bigger tax cuts. ""There is no regular monetary policy meeting in China, and hence it can adjust rates any time. Skipping OMO today per se does not have an implication on future rates move,"" said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac. ""That said, this time round, there is minimal pressure for the PBOC to hike OMO rates given the narrow spreads with market rates."" The interest rate for seven-day reverse repurchase agreements stood at 2.55 percent in the last cash injection on Sept.20, while market rates largely swung in a range of 2.55 to 2.7 percent in recent months. Reverse repos are one of its most commonly used tools to control liquidity in the financial system. The PBOC has not changed benchmark one-year lending or deposit rate since October 2015. With 60 billion yuan ($8.73 billion) worth of reverse repos maturing on Thursday, the PBOC drained the same amount of funds from the money market for the day. The yuan was little changed after the Fed and PBOC decision. Chinese authorities took several steps last month to stabilise the currency after largely standing aside and letting it fall for 10 straight weeks over the summer. But analysts expect it will come under renewed pressure in coming months if the U.S. dollar remains buoyant and as U.S. tariffs start to bite on China's exporters, prompting Beijing to roll out more easing measures.

That is historically a negative indicator for longer-term growth prospects that hurts financial stocks because higher yields tend to boost lending profitability. Wednesday's projections showed most Fed officials expect to raise rates one more time this year and three times next year, a pace in line with the expectations of many investors. While bank stocks fell, materials shares extended their week-to-date declines. Discussions between the U.S. and its trading partners are continuing, adding to anxiety about a growth-hindering tariff fight. After the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hit fresh records last week, some analysts have said they are re-evaluating trade risks, which could challenge markets at the same time interest rates continue to rise. ""I do feel like markets are largely shrugging them off because there's no way to know what the actual outcome will be,"" said Peter Lazaroff, co-chief Investment Officer at Plancorp. ""If they escalate, it would be negative for sentiment."" The S&P 500 fell 9.59 points, or 0.3%, in a fourth straight session of losses, though it remains near last week's all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 106.93 points, or 0.4%, to 26385.28. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 17.11 points, or 0.2%, to 7990.37. On Wednesday, Canada publicly declared that any changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement have to incorporate limits on the U.S. use of tariffs on national-security grounds. The move came after the Trump administration's top trade negotiator threatened to move forward with a bilateral accord with Mexico amid a lack of progress with Canada on renegotiating NAFTA. Analysts are also tracking the relationship between the U.S. and China, which canceled trade talks scheduled for this week as a monthslong tariff spat continues. Worries about a global economic slowdown have hurt commodities this year, and the S&P 500 materials and energy sectors both dropped 1%. Oil prices edged lower after Brent crude, the global benchmark for prices, closed on Tuesday at its highest level since November 2014. Meanwhile, the drop in Treasury yields sent the financial sector down 1.3%. Some analysts said Wednesday's Fed decision was largely in line with expectations but that officials largely sticking with previous projections was a less aggressive stance than some investors had anticipated. ""It signals to investors they think the economy is doing great, but not so great that they're worried about it,"" Mr. Lazaroff said. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 3.059% from 3.102%. Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, have approached seven-year highs lately. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, fell less than 0.1%. Among individual stocks, Nike fell $1.09, or 1.3%, to $83.70 after the sportswear maker said its expenses increased last quarter, though it still topped earnings targets. Declines in those various sectors offset gains in the recently formed communications-services and health-care sectors. Netflix was among the market's best performers Wednesday, adding 8.45, or 2.3%, to 377.88. Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.3% to its highest level of the month. Corrections & Amplifications Government bond prices edged slightly higher Wednesday. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that bond prices had fallen.

2018-09-27 08:32:00,Lawsuit Against New York Fed Seen As a Policy Threat -- WSJ,"By Michael S. Derby This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (September 27, 2018). A lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York could complicate the central bank's effort to control short-term interest rates at a time when investor scrutiny of those markets is intensifying. TNB USA Inc. contends in a federal suit filed in late August that it has been wrongly blocked in its pursuit of a ""master account"" at the Fed that would allow it to earn interest on deposits placed on the Fed's books. Analysts say that if TNB won approval to offer deposit accounts to clients and other banks copied its model, the development could pose a threat to how the Fed has controlled short-term rates since the 2008 crisis. Instead of targeting a specific short-term rate, as it did before the financial meltdown, the Fed now sets a firm range between the rate it will pay deposit-taking banks at the high end, and the overnight reverse repurchase rate that is available to an approved roster of money managers and other institutions at the low end. The fed-funds rate floats in between. TNB and other banks like it could thwart this system, analysts said, by collecting interest at the higher rate and offering that rate, minus a spread to cover costs and profits, to institutions that deposit money with them. ""I applaud the cleverness of this,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. ""That spread was sitting out there and somebody found a way to take advantage of that."" The Fed's range for the funds rate now stands at between 2.00% and 2.25%, with the interest on excess reserves rate at 2.20%, following the conclusion of its interest-rate setting meeting Wednesday. TNB and banks like it would allow the sort of firms that would otherwise earn the lower reverse repo rate a way to get a higher return. That could render the rate floor moot. The Fed would still have a lot of control over short-term rates, but the lower end floor could cease to be a meaningful rate. Some Fed watchers say the threat to the rate control regime may not prove that big a deal. For some time now, there has been little actual interest from eligible firms to earn the reverse repo rate, as those firms have put their money to work in other places, with better returns. George Selgin, a Cato Institute senior fellow, attributes this situation in a blog post to ""the tendency of the Fed's policy rate settings to lag further and further behind increases in market-determined interest rates"" in a time of expanding budget deficits. Regardless of market conditions, TNB says it isn't trying to break the system, and it is explained to the Fed how it will limit its activities to accomplish that. The Fed ""has a clear statutory obligation"" to grant the official account, said James McAndrews, a former Fed research official who is leading TNB. He also believes the TNB model is entirely complementary of the Fed's monetary policy goals and reinforces what's now in place. The Fed hasn't said why it hasn't approved TNB's application beyond unspecified ""policy concerns,"" TNB's lawsuit says. Central bank watchers say the denial is essentially without precedent. TNB is operating under a temporary charter that Connecticut banking regulators granted in August 2017 that expires next year. The New York Fed has thus far not responded to the suit, and it and the Fed's Board of Governors declined to address the claims. Peter Conti-Brown, a legal studies and business ethics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said he's ""not convinced that the Fed has the legal authority to deny TNB its master account."" The Fed ""will have to show why it has the statutory authority to use discretion to deny"" an application like TNB's, Mr. Conti-Brown said. There are longer-term implications of the TNB model. If it proved popular -- and there is no way to know yet whether it would -- it could serve as the first step on a longer march to connect the public to the central bank more directly. Some academics have argued monetary policy could be made more potent if people and companies were allowed to bank directly with the Fed, via interest-bearing accounts. Fed policy changes could then bypass fickle financial markets and make themselves felt at the consumer level, which would in theory make rate changes more powerful. TNB may not be seeking such an outcome, but a successful performance of its model could start the wheels turning for such a world. TNB is ""another manifestation of how innovation runs ahead of regulation, "" said David Beckworth, of George Mason University's Mercatus Center. ""The Fed's fear is not only destroying the floor system, but moving their balance sheet one step closer to more and more entities and ultimately the public."" Write to Michael S.

2018-09-27 06:59:00,"WRAPUP 2-China, NZ shrug off Fed, but FX risks seen pushing Philippines and Indonesia to hike","* Fed lifts rates, marks end of ""accommodative"" policy * NZ holds rates, Taiwan expected to hold later * BSP, BI seen hiking on Thursday; RBI set to hike next week * Asian economies gravitate towards China, away from U.S. (Recasts; Adds HKMA, PBOC) By Swati Pandey and Vatsal Srivastava SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China and New Zealand sat tight after the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike, but both Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to tap the policy brakes later on Thursday to prop up their battered currencies and temper financial risks. In a statement that marked the end of the era of ""accommodative"" policy, Fed policymakers lifted rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 2.00-2.25 percent. The U.S. central bank foresees another hike in December, three more next year, and one in 2020. The Fed outlook is pressuring Asian currencies across the board, but not all countries need to tweak their policy. New Zealand is comfortable with a weaker kiwi as it helps its exporters. In China, a weaker yuan does raise concerns about capital outflows, but its currency is tightly managed and it also has capital control tools to mitigate financial risks. For countries that run widening trade deficits, however, weaker currencies are posing risks to inflation, growth and financial stability. ""Policies in Philippines, Indonesia and India will remain in a tightening mode,"" said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is seen hiking rates by 50 bps to 4.50 percent later on Thursday to curb inflation and shore up the fragile peso, adding to the three hikes worth 100 bps since May. In August, inflation surged to a more than nine-year high of 6.4 percent, above the central bank's 2-4 percent comfort range, prompting policymakers to say they will take ""strong immediate action."" Around the same time as the BSP, Bank Indonesia is seen adding 25 bps to its four previous hikes this year, bringing rates to 5.75 percent, or 150 bps higher since May. The peso is trading around its lowest in 12 years, having shed some 8 percent against the dollar year-to-date, while the rupiah is around a two-decade low after a 9 percent plunge. Asia's worst performing currency, the rupee, which has weakened by more than 12 percent to record lows, is also likely to be a key consideration for Reserve Bank of India, which is expected to hike by 25 bps next week. ""This (Fed) tightening will likely prove too much for the rest of the world,"" said Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International. ""Emerging market economies, in particular, have already been facing tighter financial conditions this year, which have resurfaced some vulnerabilities as capital flows started reversing."" The Hong Kong Monetary Authority moved in lockstep with the Fed as its currency is pegged to the greenback. GRAVITY PULL For the stronger Asian economies, which are increasingly gravitating towards China on trade and investment, and away from the United States, the Fed outlook does not move the needle as much as it did during its previous tightening cycles. South Korea's central bank Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, as well as weakness in inflation and the job market weighed against policy tightening. Later on Thursday, Taiwan is also widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 1.375 percent. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept rates at 1.75 percent, where they have been for the past two years, citing tepid inflation and the risk of a trade war. Like most economies in Asia, New Zealand is now much more closely integrated with China than with the United States. Worries that China's economy is slowing and will further suffer from an intensifying trade row with Washington are therefore more relevant for most Asian economies' interest rate outlook than the strength of the U.S. economy. New Zealand now trades about twice as much with China than it does with the United States, a consequence of Beijing's staggering growth over the last two decades. When Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, triggering the global financial crisis, New Zealand traded with the United States 1.35 times more than with China. Just before Beijing joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, that ratio was 4.25 times in Washington's favour. ""China’s economic outlook matters more than the U.S.,"" said Mark Wills, who develops multi-asset strategies for institutional clients at State Street Global Advisors. ASIAN EMs STRONGER China's central bank skipped open market operations on Thursday, meaning it did not immediately adjust borrowing costs for interbank loans after the Fed hike. The People's Bank of China stood pat in June, but raised rates slightly in March shortly after Fed's move. Despite the trade risks and slowing consumption, China is still seen growing at an impressive rate of around 6.5 percent this year. For Asian emerging markets, this is an advantage that they have over peers in Latin America and elsewhere. That, coupled with less worrying current account deficits and stronger economic prospects, is likely to help Asia avoid the kind of tumult that has seen Argentina hike rates to 60 percent and Turkey to 24 percent this year. ""Asian central banks have been vigilant, and pre-emptive ... in running their monetary policies,"" said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corporation. ""They gain credibility in this cycle."" (Reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney and Vatsal Srivastava in Singapore; Writing by Marius Zaharia in Hong Kong Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",Reuters News
2018-09-27 06:00:00,US Fed Rate Rise Adding Pressure on Bank of Korea -- Market Talk,"0400 GMT - The Federal Reserve's Wednesday rate increase--the third for this year--and its signal to lift interest rates again later this year and through 2019 are adding pressure on the Bank of Korea to follow suit. BOK Gov. Lee Ju-yeol told reporters early Thursday that he will closely monitor widening US-Korean rate differentials and possible capital flight as a result, though he expects the Fed's latest rate increase to have limited impact on local markets for now. The Fed lifted the US benchmark federal-funds rate to a range of 2%-2.25% while the BOK policy rate has been held steady at 1.5% since November. Lee reaffirmed he would pare support for growth or tighten policy, but gave no clue to exactly when. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com ; @kwanwoo) 0348 GMT - China's attempt to dial back its efforts to cut overcapacity and leverage its economy to cushion the fallout of trade tensions with the US may be impacting profit growth for foreign-owned companies, say economists. Profit growth for foreign-owned firms slowed to 7.6% on-year in August versus 10% at Chinese-owned private enterprises and 26.7% for state-owned enterprises. SOEs benefited from working on projects related to fiscal stimulus, such as railway infrastructure projects with anti-pollution work supporting local government entities that are classified as Chinese private enterprises, says ING's Iris Pang. Foreign-companies did not benefit from any meaningful increase in business, she added.

""The fact that overnight rates have been kept at an extremely stable level...in recent months also suggests that [the central bank] has no intention to move its policy rate near term"" as previous hikes had been signaled, the investment bank notes. The CBC meets today. (chester.yung@wsj.com; @chester_yung) 0244 GMT - The sharp rebound in oil prices the past few years hasn't been boosting the trade picture at crude exporter Malaysia, notes Nomura. That's because the Southeast Asian nation has become a larger net importer of petroleum products, leaving the overall oil trade balance in a small deficit since 2013. The investment bank adds that the lag in prices for LNG, which in general move with oil, suggests that any positive effects from that will likely only show up in 2019. That's also when Nomura expects slower global economic growth, perhaps curtailing demand for the fuel, which Malaysia also exports. (yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com; @yantoultra) 0239 GMT - [Dow Jones] The Federal Reserve's rising rates may put more downward pressure on emerging-market currencies, including the Malaysian ringgit. But the ringgit is largely dependent on sentiment, though the currency will remain relatively well supported, according to Kenanga Research. This would likely limit the downside on the ringgit, though Kenanga still expects it to remain weak against major currencies, especially the U.S dollar. It expects the ringgit to test the 4.15 per dollar level soon. The ringgit has weakened only 2.4% against the U.S dollar year-to-date, better than most of its peers. It is now 4.14 per dollar. Kenanga's year-end target is 4.05 per dollar. (yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com ; @yantoultra) 0146 GMT - Though no rate hike will happen Tuesday, Australia's central bank may provide some comment on financial-system stability, says Citi economist Paul Brennan. The RBA board is likely to be briefed by senior staff on the issue ahead of the Oct. 12 publication of the central bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Review. Brennan says this would provide an opportunity for the RBA to share its view on the increase in money-market funding spreads the last few months. If mortgage rates continue to rise, it will argue for the central bank to wait even longer before boosting its policy rate. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ) 0137 GMT - Capital Economics has said that another 2018 interest-rate hike in India remains in the cards.

The PBoC set the midpoint for the dollar's daily trading range at CNY6.8642, compared with CNY6.8571 yesterday. China has been restraining the pace of the yuan's decline in the fix, setting it stronger than prior-day onshore closing levels in recent days. On Wednesday, the pair finished at CNY6.8740.

A resale in a middle-class Island East estate was done after the asking price was slashed 15%, according to real-estate agent Centaline, after a 20% reduction in a unit of a Kowloon public-private co-op project. Still, Centaline doesn't expect a jump in the benchmark lending rate, even if the Fed hikes again in December, so incremental lending burdens on homeowners would be quite small.

The latest climate forecasts indicate conditions are likely to be drier and warmer than average over the coming months, meaning a low chance of recovery for drought-affected areas of eastern Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology says in its latest climate note. Weather conditions and sea temperatures over the Pacific and Indian Oceans, while currently neutral, point in modelling to a drought-worsening El Nino weather phenomenon forming in spring, the bureau says. One of the driest winters on record has seen crop forecasts lowered sharply, while some regional communities have dam levels at only 10% of capacity and may soon run out of water.

While critics say the levy may harm tourism, which last year bypassed dairy as New Zealand's biggest export, Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage says the money will help ""improve the protection and enhancement of New Zealand's distinctive natural environment and improve tourism planning."" Almost 4 million tourists visited New Zealand the past year; the country's population is 4.7 million.

2018-09-26 23:26:00,UPDATE 2-Traders keep bets on U.S. Fed's 2019  interest rate  rises,"(Updates market action, adds quote) By Ann Saphir and Richard Leong Sept 26 (Reuters) - Interest rates futures traders on Wednesday stuck with bets the Federal Reserve will raise rates once more this year and two times next year even after the central bank released forecasts flagging a slightly steeper rate rise path. Contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate that are traded at CME Group's Chicago Board of Trade rose in the wake of the Fed's expected third rate increase in 2018 on Wednesday and after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat comments on the economy after the Fed's two-day meeting. The higher pricing in the contracts was not large enough to alter traders' expectations for a Fed rate hike in December, which would bring it to a target range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. It implied traders expect two more rate increases in 2019. Fed forecasts released on Wednesday showed Fed policymakers themselves view three rate hikes as likely needed next year. ""The projected path on interest rates is the same,"" said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in New York. ""I think a December hike is pretty well baked in."" Meanwhile, policy-makers ended their long-running characterization of their policy stance as ""accommodative."" The Fed ""is probably close to being done raising rates even though they flagged a few more hikes,"" said Mark McCormick, head of TD Securities' North American FX strategy. With unemployment at 3.9 percent, well below what most Fed officials view as sustainable in the long run, inflation was still expected to creep only slightly above the central bank's 2.0 percent target, Fed forecasts released Wednesday show. Fed policymakers did not jack up their expectations for rate hikes in coming years, as some analysts had thought, instead sticking closely to rate hike path forecasts outlined in June that envision short-term rates, now at 2.0 percent to 2.25 percent, to be at 3.1 percent by the end of next year. Their latest rate projections, together with Powell's comment that the Fed does not expect upside surprise on inflation, spurred a wave of buying in longer-dated Treasuries. This trade flattened the yield curve, narrowing the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields to just a tad less than 23 basis points, which was the tightest level in more than a week.

2018-09-26 23:13:00,Wall Street rally disintegrates shortly before the close,"(Reuters) - A Wall Street rally collapsed and stocks turned negative shortly before the market close on Wednesday after investors reassessed the Federal Reserve's policy statement and reduced their risk as they weighed how long the U.S. central bank would continue to raise interest rates. U.S. stocks initially extended gains after the Fed, as expected, raised interest rates and left its monetary policy outlook for the coming years largely unchanged amid steady economic growth and a strong job market. But the market reversed course as investors weighed to what degree the elimination of the word ""accommodative"" from the Fed's policy statement suggested that the end of a cycle of interest-rate hikes might be in sight. The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 2.00 percent to 2.25 percent. ""People misinterpreted the removal of 'accommodative' in the statement,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""People realized that monetary policy remains on course and there are expectations of another rate hike this year, and they unwound purchases they made on the release of the statement, and also additional de-risking going into the close."" The S&P 500 financial index <.SPSY> fell 1.27 percent, leading declines. The S&P 500 utilities index <.SPLRCU> and real estate index <.SPLRCR>, which are sensitive to interest rates because their components are often favored for their dividend yields, each fell over 1 percent. The Fed still foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the policy meeting that the U.S. central bank is closely monitoring inflation, underscoring concerns the U.S. economy's rapid growth could lead to overheating and force the Fed to raise rates further. Referring to the removal of the word ""accommodative,"" Powell said, ""This change does not signal any change in the likely path of policy. Instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations.” The stock market has enjoyed a boom period and is at record levels.

2018-09-26 21:22:00,"What a Fed rate hike means for you, at any age","No matter your age, what the Federal Reserve does to interest rates will most likely affect you. The central bank raised what's called the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent Wednesday, the third such increase this year. An increase creates a ripple effect for rates on a variety of loans and investments. ""Interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing,"" said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference following the rate increase. But Powell pointed out that rates are ""still quite low by historical levels."" Higher rates can mean different things to people, depending on where they are in life. In general, for people borrowing money, it means life is getting more expensive. For savers, it means slightly bigger rewards. Here's a look at some of the effects: FOR 20-SOMETHINGS What's rising even faster than college tuitions? The financing costs to pay for them. Student-loan rates have been climbing along with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has risen above 3 percent. Undergraduate students taking out federal direct loans this school year will pay a fixed 5.05 percent interest rate. That's a significant jump from the 4.45 percent rate of the prior school year, and it's the highest since 2009-10, when it was 5.6 percent. The rate is fixed, so direct federal loans taken out for the 2018-19 academic year will keep the 5.05 percent rate. The Fed reiterated Wednesday that it expects to raise rates one more time this year and another three times in 2019. Unless that changes, long-term rates would also rise, so student loans taken out next year will likely have a higher rate. Interest rates for private loans are already traditionally higher and will likely rise as well. Additionally, it's easy in your 20s to start to slide down the slippery slope of credit card debt. Try to resist because carrying a balance is only going to get more expensive ahead. Credit card rates are most sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate, almost directly matching the rate change with a 1.92-point increase since late 2015 when the Fed began to hike rates, said Nick Clements, co-founder of MagnifyMoney.com, a financial information website. Clements estimates that with this latest hike, the average household that carries credit card debt month to month will pay over $150 in extra interest per year compared with before the rate hikes began. MagnifyMoney estimates 122 million Americans carry credit card debt month to month. FOR YOUNG(ISH) WORKERS - 30s and 40s It's a busy time financially — people in this age group may be focused on paying down debts such as auto loans, mortgages and student loans while also trying to stoke their savings. Pay off any variable-rate debts ASAP. That means paying down credit cards, home equity lines of credit and student loans from private lenders as quickly as possible before these borrowing costs rise. To put this in perspective, since the Fed began raising rates, the average credit card rate has jumped from 15.78 percent to 17.32 percent; the average home equity line of credit has climbed from 4.75 percent to 6.08 percent, according to Bankrate.com. And those with adjustable rate mortgages expecting a rate reset this year will see the rate jump to 5.25 percent or more. Speaking of mortgages, because interest rates are on an upward trajectory, new mortgage debt will also most likely be getting more expensive. The fed funds rate and mortgages don't always move in lockstep for a number of reasons. But since late 2015, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has increased from approximately 3.9 percent to 4.6 percent, as of Sept. 13. If you are looking for a mortgage, shop around for the best rate. If you have an adjustable rate mortgage that is expected to reset higher soon, consider refinancing to a lower fixed-rate now. Meanwhile, members of this group should also save for retirement and build up their emergency savings. For the latter, consider banking online, where you can find numerous savings accounts with rates around 2 percent. FOR NEAR-RETIREMENT OR RETIRED — 50, 60, 70 AND BEYOND Huzzah. Savers are finally earning more on their cash — if only just a bit. The national rate for a 12-month CD is 0.45 percent, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That sounds like a pittance of interest, but it's double the rate from a couple years ago. Rates for longer-term CDs are also rising, and the national rate for a five-year CD is up to 1.11 percent from 0.87 percent a year ago. Such low figures mean many savers still aren't keeping up with inflation, but analysts expect rates to continue trending higher. Savers can also typically find better rates at online banks than at traditional ones — they sometimes even match the rate of inflation, which was 2.7 percent last month. For a three-year CD, several online banks offer rates at that level or slightly higher. Now on to those investments you worked so hard on. Higher interest rates hurt investors with bond funds in their 401(k) accounts, at least in the short term. A rise in rates makes the bonds sitting in a bond fund's portfolio suddenly less attractive, when compared against newly issued bonds that are paying more in interest. That causes those bonds' prices to drop, and the dynamic has caused many of the most popular bond funds to lose money this year. The largest bond fund by assets is down 2.1 percent through Monday, for example. But those funds will also be earning more in interest thanks to the higher rates and should be able to offset those losses in the long run, as long as rates rise gradually. Stock funds should also feel an effect, and emerging-market funds have been among the biggest losers recently. But as long as the rise in rates is due to a strengthening economy, rather than fears about a surge in inflation, analysts say stock funds should be able to hold steady. That's because a better economy usually spells higher corporate profits.

2018-09-26 20:45:00,Powell Not Worried By Trump's Monetary Policy Pot Shots -- Market Talk,"1445 ET - In his press conference after the FOMC meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was asked about whether President Donald Trump's criticism of rate rises are a problem. Powell doesn't say the president's name and falls back on central bank boilerplate, noting ""we don't consider political factors or things like that"" when making policy. Instead, he says the Fed focuses on its mission. (michael.derby@wsj.com) 1415 ET - US government bond yields tick lower, then pare their declines, after the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates and removes the word ""accommodative"" from its policy statement. Investors had been widely expecting the central bank to raise rates in September, but had been less sure of whether the Fed would signal a more aggressive approach to future rate increases. That had driven yields higher heading into Wednesday's meeting, although traders said on first glance, the Fed's latest policy statement didn't strike them as being hawkish. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell to around 3.065% before recently trading at 3.078%, compared with 3.102% Tuesday. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani) 1411 ET - The Fed's interest rate forecasts may not hold any great surprises relative to what was seen in June, but it's notable that central bankers see an extended period of time of running monetary policy above its long run level. The Fed may be dispensing with descriptions of policy as ""accommodative"" and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may be pushed the concept of neutral rates off to the margin. Still, against the Fed's estimate of a long-term fed funds target rate of 3%, they see monetary policy delivering rates above that in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Given the duration of the business cycle, trade war rumblings and the worries about the yield curve, it will be very interesting to see if the Fed can deliver on such a hawkish policy outlook. (michael.derby@wsj.com) 1410 ET - The September Federal Reserve policy statement showed no change in officials' characterization of the economy and its strength compared with the previous policy statement. Officials said the labor market has continued to strengthen, while the economy has been rising at a strong pace. Meanwhile, inflation remains near the central bank's 2% target. The main change in September's statement, other than the rate increase decision, was the drop of ""accommodative"" in the description of interest rates. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com) 1407 ET - Twelve of 16 Fed officials now expect four interest rate increases this year, more than in previous months, according to new economic projections. In June, eight Fed officials expected at least four rate rises in 2018. The higher number of officials projecting four rate bumps signals a stronger belief among officials that the economy is running strong, necessitating gradual rate increases to keep it from overheating. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com) 1404 ET - Federal Reserve officials removed language in their policy statement that had described short-term interest rates as ""accommodative,"" meaning they are still low enough to stimulate economic growth. Most officials think rates are still accommodative but are becoming less so with each rate increase, and are on track to reach a neutral level that neither spurs nor slows growth in coming months. The problem is officials' aren't sure where neutral lies or when they'll get there. Waiting until later this year or next year to drop the phrase would have risked sending an unintended message then that they agreed they were at neutral, which they are unlikely to do, given the uncertainties involved. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com) 1402 ET - Central bank officials voted to raise their benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range between 2% and 2.25%, according to Wednesday's policy statement. The decision to raise interest rates for the third time this year is in line with expectations for the Fed to gradually raise rates as the economy remains on a path of strength. The bigger question is how Fed Chairman Jerome Powell might characterize the balance of risks at the press conference. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com) 1341 ET - One key thing to watch after the Fed meeting, assuming a rate rise happens, is what happens with the yield curve. The difference between two and 10-year Treasury securities continues to stand within spitting distance of going negative, with the spread currently right around 25 basis points. It's possible a rate rise or two more, which the Fed could easily deliver this year, could kick that spread into negative territory, with ominous portents for the economic outlook. Some key Fed officials like New York Fed leader John Williams have downplayed this relationship, but others, like St Louis' James Bullard, have cautioned against doing the ""this time it's different"" argument. (michael.derby@wsj.com) 1325 ET - This year's rate tightening campaign has been met with not a single dissenting vote. That's unlikely to change today, as all of the voting members have indicated they're on board with further action. Personal shifts, most notably John Williams moving from the San Francisco Fed to New York, haven't altered the balance. There will be one new voting member with the entrance of Richard Clarida as vice-chair, but nobody expects him to dissent. Perhaps the one curiosity in FOMC voting patterns this year has been Raphael Bostic in Atlanta, the first African-American regional bank head in the Fed's history. Left leaning activists wanted a minority, believing such a person would be more sensitive to how marginalized groups experience monetary policy. But by and large, Bostic has been on board with rate rises, even when the activists opposed them. FOMC voting patterns may become more interesting with the final two meetings, when Mary Daly takes over in San Francisco. (michael.derby@wsj.com) 1255 ET - Capital Economics notes today that over the last year, the Fed really hasn't run down its balance sheet all that much. So far, its only shed about $250B off what was $4.5 trillion in holdings. They also note that at the current pace it won't be until 2021 that the balance sheet goes under the $3 trillion mark. Capital Economics observes in its note that credit activity has been wholly unaffected by balance sheet shrinkage. On the upside for the Fed, the drawdown continues to be a complete nonevent for financial markets. About the only time the balance sheet has bubbled up as an issue is when some speculated tweaks to the Fed's drawdown strategy could help ward off an inversion of the yield curve.

The update follows the announcement that the bank agreed to sold a portfolio of EUR2.8 billion of gross loans, including EUR2.7 billion of non-performing loans, equivalent to about a third of the bank's total NPLs. According to Fitch Ratings, the transaction ""will be positive for the BoC's credit risk profile and will reduce capital encumbrance by unreserved problem assets."" It is expected to be finalised by end-2018 or first quarter of next year. It expresses the view that ""the execution risk on the transaction is small given the strong incentives for all involved parties to complete the deal.""

The economic slowdown in China ""will not only be a drag on the value of the remnibi versus the dollar in the months ahead"" but it will dampen investors' risk appetite ""for some time."" Ebbing risk appetite is ""detrimental"" to emerging market assets. ""In contrast, strong growth and higher yields in the U.S. are likely to continue supporting broad-based dollar,"" which has been behind most of the fall in emerging market assets.

Officials voted unanimously Wednesday on the increase, which will bring the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%. Most officials expect to raise rates one more time this year, according to new projections released after the meeting. The increase is the third this year and the eighth since the Fed began to lift rates in late 2015 after keeping them pinned near zero after the 2008 financial crisis. Wednesday's decision marks the first time that the Fed has raised rates above 2% since a series of rate cuts that followed the government's intervention in March 2008 to prevent the liquidation of Bear Stearns Cos. It also is the first time in a decade rates will rise above inflation, measured by the Fed's preferred gauge, excluding volatile energy and food categories. So-called core prices rose 2% in July. The Fed over the past year has returned interest rates to a more normal setting while also gradually reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. The big question now is how much further officials think they need to go to raise rates to keep the economy from overheating. The Fed targets a 2% inflation rate, which it sees as a sign of healthy demand. It wants to avoid economic growth that becomes unsustainable, leading to a boom and then bust. Altogether, these moves should ripple through the economy by steadily raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Rising mortgage rates, for example, appear to have slowed home sales this year. Higher borrowing costs steal pricing power from sellers who have benefited from rising prices in recent years. Fed officials removed a phrase from their post-meeting statement that for years has described their rate stance as ""accommodative,"" meaning they are pressing on the gas pedal to help stimulate growth. Dropping the language now doesn't necessarily signal that officials believe rates are no longer low enough to stimulate growth. Instead, the change reflects how officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, want to move away from providing overly precise estimates of where such a neutral setting stands given the inherent uncertainty in such measures. The Fed made no other changes to its statement, which it has now purged of nearly all references to the future stance of monetary policy. Removing such forward guidance reflects how the central bank is moving into a new phase of policy setting that could be more uncertain. Twelve of 16 officials now expect the Fed will raise rates a total of four times this year, up from eight of 15 officials in June and just four of 16 last December. Most officials expect the Fed would need to raise rates at least three more times next year and once more in 2020. Most officials see the Fed refraining from additional rate increases after that, leaving rates in a range between 3.25% and 3.5% by the end of 2020 and through 2021. The new interest-rate guidance shows most Fed officials believe they will need to raise short-term rates slightly beyond the level they expect is likely to prevail when supply and demand are perfectly balanced. Two thirds of officials expect that longer-run rate sits around 2.75% or 3%. Fed officials have upgraded their economic outlook over the past year, first because of a synchronized upturn in global growth beginning last summer, and later after Congress approved stimulus in the form of tax cuts and increased federal spending. Officials made few changes to their economic projections in September. The median projection now sees gross domestic product rising 3.1% this year, up from 2.8% in June and 2.7% in March. Officials continued to estimate the economy's long run growth rate sits at 1.8% and that growth will return to that level by 2021. Officials nudged up their unemployment forecast. They expect the jobless rate will end the year at 3.7%, versus a projection of 3.6% in June. That is still below all officials' estimates of the level of unemployment they expect to prevail over the long run. Estimates of this so-called natural rate of unemployment range from 4% to 4.6%. Their inflation projections were virtually unchanged. All officials see inflation holding between 2% and 2.3% over the coming years after several years in which the Fed struggled to reach the target. Just how much more the Fed continues to raise rates will depend largely on whether inflation behaves as they expect it to. One camp of officials says so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level that they project is consistent with stable prices, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion. Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials say if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a ""neutral"" setting designed to neither spur nor slow growth. Mr. Powell hasn't revealed his preference, but in an August speech he sounded sympathetic to treating the traditional models more skeptically than some of his colleagues or staff. Given the strength of the U.S. economy, turbulence abroad represents perhaps the biggest risk to the Fed's plans. In 2015 and 2016, officials held back planned rate increases due to upheaval in global markets, mostly emanating from China. The Fed could be forced to reconsider its plans if something similar occurs, for example, if a stronger dollar triggers upheaval in emerging markets, which in turns spills into China amid rising trade tensions with the U.S. (END) Dow Jones Newswires September 26, 2018 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT)",Dow Jones Institutional News

At 8:59 a.m. (1259 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was nearly unchanged at 1.2955 to the greenback, or 77.19 U.S. cents. The currency, which last Thursday touched its strongest level in more than three months at 1.2885, traded in a narrow range of 1.2945 to 1.2966. The U.S. dollar        rose against a basket of major currencies before a widely anticipated Fed rate hike priced in by investors still on edge about a trade row between the United States and China. Canada has its own trade dispute with the United States and is in slow-moving talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The country is not making concessions needed to reach a deal with the United States for a trilateral NAFTA pact and is running out of time before Washington proceeds with a Mexico-only agreement, a top U.S. official said on Tuesday. As the month-end deadline for the trade talks nears, Canadian executives who hedge foreign exchange risk have been changing their strategies so their companies can profit from any possible swings in the Canadian dollar. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, eased but was still heading for a fifth consecutive quarter of gains, driven by an impending drop in Iranian exports in the last three months of the year when global demand heats up. U.S. crude        prices were down 0.6 percent at $71.84 a barrel. Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve, with the 10-year             rising 1 Canadian cent to yield 2.459 percent. On Tuesday, the 10-year yield touched its highest intraday in more than four months at 2.472 percent.

HIGHER AND HIGHER The Federal Reserve is set to raise short-term interest rates Wednesday -- the eighth increase since late 2015 and third this year. It doesn't look like officials are ready to stop. At their June meeting, a narrow majority projected the Fed would raise rates a total of four times in 2018. That group is likely to grow this week. The bigger question: What happens next year? The WSJ's Nick Timiraos writes that there are two schools of thought. 1.) Conventional wisdom : Low and falling unemployment means the Fed will need to raise rates to slow the economy and prevent it from overheating. 2.) Radical departure : As long as inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a ""neutral"" setting designed to neither spur nor slow growth. Extra: We'll also get revised projections on future rate moves (the dot plot) and the economy. Finally, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell steps up to the mic at 2:30 p.m. ET to hash it all out with reporters. Do you think the Fed needs to keep raising rates to cool off an overheating economy?

President Trump spends another day at the United Nations. He's set to meet separately with the prime ministers of Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. TOP STORIES KEEP ON LIFTING The Fed influences interest rates across the economy, but it doesn't dictate them. Average rates for credit cards, auto loans and home-equity lines of credit have all drifted higher as the Fed lifted its benchmark. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now at the highest level since 2011, according to Freddie Mac. But the average rate on a 5-year new-car loan is still lower than in 2011, when the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate was near zero, according to Bankrate.com. Ultimately, consumer borrowing costs are set in the markets based on a variety of factors, Paul Kiernan reports. ADIOS, CANADA The Trump administration's top trade negotiator threatened to move forward with a bilateral accord with Mexico amid a lack of progress with Canada on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trump administration's threat raises uncertainties for business leaders and farmers: the treaty has allowed automobile makers and other industries to create supply chains that span the continent. A bilateral trade deal would disrupt those supply chains and raise the possibility of a eventual price increases, William Mauldin reports. There's an end-of-month deadline to reach a deal. I WON'T BACK DOWN President Trump criticized international organizations and alliances as unaccountable and defended his administration's hard-line trade policies at the United Nations General Assembly. ""We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated and our wealth to be plundered and transferred,"" he said. ""America will never apologize for protecting our citizens."" WINS AND LOSSES The conventional wisdom is that a trade war will hit U.S. partners harder than the U.S. But a paper by the European Central Bank estimates that a trade war with the rest of the world could knock about 2% off of U.S. economic growth, while China and other economies could gain. ECB economists modeled a scenario in which the U.S. raises tariffs on all of its imports by 10 percentage points, and its trading partners retaliate in kind. The higher tariffs would reduce household incomes and hurt business confidence, weighing on private consumption and investment, Tom Fairless writes. WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING CONFIDENT? U.S. consumer confidence hit an 18-year high in September as robust job growth and a strong economic outlook bolstered Americans' expectations for the future. The latest reading suggests Americans aren't too worried about trade tensions. Instead, lofty sentiment bodes well for consumer spending and economic growth, Harriet Torry writes. Macroeconomic Advisers is tracking third-quarter gross domestic product at a 3.3% annual pace and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is forecasting 4.4%.

2018-09-26 12:06:00,Fed's Introduction of 2021 Rate Projections May Cap Short-Term Rates: ING -- Market Talk,"1006 GMT - The Federal Reserve in its monetary policy announcement on Wednesday could introduce the 2021 dot in its ""dot plot"" interest-rate projections. If the median dot remains at 3.4%, that ""would put an end-date on the hiking cycle,"" ING says. This would ""cap short-term U.S. rates for now,"" as well as the dollar, according to ING. ""The projections are typically extended by one year at September meetings and here the focus will be on where officials see policy heading in 2021."" The Fed decision is at 1800 GMT. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com) 0955 GMT - Market participants are pricing in 50 basis points of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in 2019, and if the Fed says later on Wednesday that it no longer sees its policy as ""accommodative"", these expectations won't extend much further, says ING. ""If the Fed were to no longer see U.S. monetary policy as being accommodative...one could infer that we are now in the latter stages of the tightening cycle - with policy approaching a neutral stance."" Therefore, ""policy moves may well be more data and market dependent - meaning limited need for investors to price in further Fed tightening."" The Fed is expected to raise rates on Wednesday by 25 bps to 2.25%. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com) 0948 GMT - The Italian government is eventually likely to respect the fiscal rules because ""they need financial markets on their side to raise funding for at least part of their plans,"" says Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management. The budget, to be presented on Thursday, might show a fiscal deficit of 1.6% to 2% of GDP for 2019, higher than last year's but roughly in line with this year's expected outcome, and is likely to be ""reluctantly accepted by Brussels,"" she says. Ms. Dall'Angelo says gradualism will probably be the government's key word and the budget plan will probably include some watered-down versions of the promised policies. (emese.bartha@wsj.com' @EmeseBartha) 0945 GMT - Independent credit research firm CreditSights holds an ""underperform"" recommendation on Vodafone bonds, it says as the telecommuncations company comes to the market with a four-tranche multi-currency hybrid issuance. The recommendation reflects Vodafone's willingness to raise leverage to fill its infrastructure gap versus incumbents, while pressure in its core European markets, combined with spectrum auctions act as a headwind to near-term deleveraging, CreditSights says. That said, it expects Vodafone's hybrid deal to go well. The issuance comes more at fair value than necessarily cheap but technicals are supportive given scarcity and diversification benefits, CreditSights says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha) 0943 GMT - A rate increase by the Czech central bank on Wednesday seems to be a ""done deal,"" says Komercni's analyst Dalimil Vyskovsky, adding that the board is likely to point to a weaker currency as the main reason for the increase. The reaction of the EUR/CZK, currently trading flat at 25.5903, could be key, he says. If the Czech koruna weakens, then the market ""might restart pricing more hikes going forward, though we still have some 80% of the November tightening priced in,"" he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha) 0912 GMT - The greenback moving little ahead of today's Fed pronouncement has meant little doing for currencies generally. But maybe the Singapore dollar will ease some afterward. UOB estimates the currency is 1.2% above the midpoint of its nominal effective exchange-rate band and predicts the local currency will trade 0.5-1.5% above it. Versus the US dollar, that implies a range of S$1.3623-1.3759 based on currency levels this morning. The greenback remains around S$1.3650. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com) 0831 GMT - The central bank in the Czech Republic is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.50% when it announces a policy decision at 1100 GMT, but this is unlikely to move the Czech koruna. The decision is widely anticipated and already priced into the currency, as is a further rate rise to 1.75% by the end of this year, says UniCredit. ""Barring any new signals coming from the CNB today, which we do not expect, EUR/CZK has likely built out a base at current levels,"" UniCredit says. EUR/CZK is last down 0.1% at 25.5833.

(olga.cotaga@wsj.com) 0815 GMT - Emerging market currencies ""are not out of the woods"" even though a Federal Reserveinterest rate increase later on Wednesday is widely expected, says UniCredit. The simultaneous action of the Fed unwinding its balance sheet, coupled with increased U.S. Treasury issuance, ""may still tighten global liquidity conditions in the months ahead and weigh on several EM currencies."" However, if U.S. inflation were to come in below expectations on Friday, this ""could provide some more support to EM."" Most EM currencies are up against the dollar on Wednesday.

""A sub 2% deficit may provide BTPs with further support but we continue to see significant uncertainties around passing the budget and [credit] ratings,"" say Societe Generale's rates strategists.

Italy's government is expected to present its budget draft for 2019 on Thursday. The 200-210 basis point spread is an initial target and the tightening could be even more pronounced ""if some of the non-resident investors that sharply reduced their exposure to Italian government bonds in May and June returned, Ms. Cremonesi says.

Investors with a more long-term strategy may wait rating reviews by Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings before extending their exposure to Italy, though, Ms. Cremonesi says.

UniCredit expects Italy's average monthly issuance at EUR17 billion in October and November, down from a monthly average of EUR20 billion in the year to date, she says. UniCredit expects the Italian treasury to cancel the mid-December bond auction, in line with previous years. The analyst says net supply will be negative until the end of the year as issuance will be accompanied by EUR54 billion of redemptions in the October to December period.

2018-09-26 12:06:00,"Fed Rate Decision: What to Watch | Consumer Rate Rises Modest | Argentine Central Banker Resigns | Bankers vs. Activists | Derby's Take: Time to Put ‘Accommodative' Fed Language Out of Its Misery? The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Wednesday, September 26, 2018","Derby's Take: Time to Put ‘Accommodative' Fed Language Out of Its Misery? Federal Reserve Readies Third Interest-Rate Increase of 2018 Modest Consumer Rate Rises Based on Variety of Factors Argentina's Central Bank President Resigns Bankers vs. Activists: Battle Lines Form Over Low-Income Lending Rules Time to Put ‘Accommodative' Fed Language Out of Its Misery? Federal Reserve watchers are split over whether the central bank will remove ""accommodative"" in describing its monetary policy when it releases its latest statement Wednesday. The term indicates Fed interest-rate policy remains supportive of the economy. And for some time now, it has been a signal more rate rises were coming. But now, the Fed's at a crossroads. Officials generally believe rate rises will no longer stop at neutral levels but go beyond that. With the unemployment rate well under what officials view as its sustainable level, and inflation hanging around the 2% target, monetary policy may have to lean against the economy's momentum to prevent overheating and keep the expansion going. Fed officials also are shifting their views about what constitutes a neutral level of interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in August he is less inclined to guide the economy by variables that rely on unmeasurable estimates, which means it may be harder to know when policy is no longer accommodative. At the same time, there are signs that the natural rate of interest, which still is looked to by many Fed officials, is shifting higher. All those moving pieces have left economists split as to whether ""accommodative"" lives or dies in the Federal Open Market Committee statement. ""Fed officials have been increasingly uncomfortable describing policy in terms of estimates of R-star,"" economists at J.P. Morgan wrote in a note, referring to the so-called natural rate of interest. ""It is against this backdrop that we anticipate the statement will remove previous references to policy being ‘accommodative.'"" Wrightson ICAP's economists also see the word dropping out, as officials chop off a vestigial limb. ""It is just the next step in the Fed's ongoing effort to disengage from the forward guidance framework that was part of its response to the Great Recession,"" the forecasting firm said. Jefferies economist Ward McCarthy expects ""accommodative"" to stay in the statement, but he expects officials to ""modify the wording to convey the message that policy is becoming gradually less accommodative."" Goldman Sachs economists say the word is ""a touch more likely than not to remain,"" although they say that the rate forecasts shown in the central bank's ""dot plot"" are the far more important variable right now. NatWest Markets economists also see a case for the status quo. ""Given that the funds rate will still be below participants' views of the long-run neutral rate after the September hike, we expect the FOMC to again indicate that ‘the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative,'"" as officials did in their most recent FOMC statement. Key Developments Around the World Federal Reserve Readies Third Interest-Rate Increase of 2018 The Federal Reserve is prepared to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point after its two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday, the eighth such move since late 2015. Officials will also present revised projections of future rate moves along with their outlook for inflation, employment and growth. The central bank releases its policy statement and the forecasts—the so-called dot plot—at 2 p.m. EDT. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell takes media questions at 2:30 p.m. Here is a look at what to watch. Modest Consumer Rate Rises Based on Variety of Factors U.S. consumer borrowing costs have drifted higher in recent months ahead of the Federal Reserve's likely decision Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates, though the increases have generally been modest. Average rates for credit cards, 30-year mortgages, auto loans and home-equity lines of credit have all risen since June 13, when the central bank announced a quarter-percentage-point increase in its benchmark rate and penciled in two more such moves this year. J.P. Morgan Goes Looking for Job-Market Bubbles, Sees a Few Candidates Most Federal Reserve officials reckon that, at a 3.9% jobless rate, the job market is running hotter than what they consider to be sustainable. The strength of the job sector raises the question: Have any parts of the labor landscape become overheated? According to a note from J.P. Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton, a jobless rate that has blown through the Fed's estimate of a 4.5% sustainable rate hasn't led to a lot of worrisome overheating, at least not yet. But he estimates that if things turned south for the economy, the tech and restaurant sectors look most inclined to take it on the chin. ECB Projects U.S. Could Be Biggest Casualty of a Global Trade Conflict The U.S. economy could shrink about 2% in the first year of a trade war with the rest of the world, while China and other economies could gain, according to new research published Wednesday by the European Central Bank. ECB officials have been fretting publicly for months about the impact of rising trade protectionism on the export-focused eurozone. The 19-nation economy has slowed this year, just as the ECB starts to tilt away from years of easy money. Argentina's Central Bank President Resigns Argentina central bank President Luis Caputo resigned less than four months into his post as the government struggles to contain economic turmoil and social unrest while it renegotiates a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Caputo on Tuesday cited personal reasons for his departure amid reports of disputes with the IMF over Argentina's exchange-rate policy. He will be succeeded by Guido Sandleris, a top Finance Ministry official who has a Ph.D. from Columbia University, specializing in finance, macroeconomics and the international economy. Mr. Sandleris had previously taught at Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires and was a visiting researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the IMF. Brazil's Central Bank Hints at Rate Increases Brazil's central bank Tuesday said inflation risks have increased but it will keep monitoring indicators before deciding on raising interest rates. Still, the bank hinted at potential rate increases in the near future. The bank said rising borrowing costs in developed economies are worsening the global scenario for emerging markets, while failure to pass economic reform in Brazil is also tilting the balance of risks. Both factors could lead to more inflation, the bank said. The assessment came out in the minutes to last week's monetary policy meeting, when the Selic benchmark rate was held at 6.5% for the fourth consecutive meeting as inflation remains below target and the economy sputters. Philippine Central Bank Official Indicates Rate Increase The Philippine central bank will ""show a strong hand"" when it announces its next policy decision Thursday, its deputy governor said Tuesday as he indicated that its key interest rate is set to rise again. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of a meeting with U.K.-based investors, Diwa Guinigundo also said he expects global economic growth to slow, partly in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest-rate rises, which should in turn persuade the U.S. central bank to ease up on the pace of tightening. Mr. Guinigundo said an increase was likely on Thursday and the move may not mark the end of the recent series of rate increases. Indonesia's Central Bank May Raise Interest Rates Indonesia's central bank is expected to stay on track to raise interest rates further amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will most likely raise its interest rates Wednesday. 11 out of the 14 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predicted the central bank to raise borrowing costs when it meets on Thursday, with many citing preventing further outflow as the main factor. FINANCIAL REGULATION ROUNDUP SEC Moves to Kill Metric That Signaled Price Mismatch in Pot Fund Wall Street's top regulator may soon get rid of a controversial metric for exchange-traded funds that just last week warned investors that a popular marijuana fund was trading at inflated prices. The measurement, known as intraday net asset value, gives investors a way to compare the price of a fund against the up-to-the-minute value of its underlying holdings. ETFs are required to report the information every 15 seconds during the trading day. The Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of an overhaul of the rules governing the $3.7 trillion U.S. ETF industry, has proposed eliminating that requirement. Instead, ETFs would have to report net asset value only once a day, at the closing bell. Comments on the proposed rule changes are due Oct. 1. Shoppers Love Rewards Credit Cards. Retailers Hate Them Consumers have become addicted to credit cards with generous rewards programs. Retailers are trying to cut them off. Large merchants including Amazon.com, Target and Home Depot are pushing for the right to reject some rewards credit cards, which typically carry higher fees for merchants. They are likely to opt out of a roughly $6.2 billion settlement Visa, Mastercard and several large banks recently reached with merchants and continue to make their case in court, according to people familiar with the matter. The retailers are trying to end the card networks' ""honor all cards"" rule, which requires merchants that accept Visa- or Mastercard-branded credit cards to take all of them. Bankers vs. Activists: Battle Lines Form Over Low-Income Lending Rules When Steven Mnuchin looked to sell his OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in 2014, a community group with an $800,000 budget tried to block the deal. That led to a nine-hour public hearing where speakers compared the bank's executives to the ebola virus and called for their imprisonment. Others voiced support. Four years later, Mr. Mnuchin is the Treasury secretary and his fellow executive at the bank, Joseph Otting, is now comptroller of the currency. And one of their big agenda items is an overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act, a law passed in 1977 to combat redlining, a practice where banks wouldn't lend in lower-income communities.

Now, there are about 160 bilateral swap lines between central banks around the world, they write. The authors say the lines ""perform a basic function of liquidity provision based around cooperation between central banks"" and they ""incentivize cross-border gross capital flows."" The Inevitable Sacrifice of Argentina's Central Banker ""Someone has to walk the plank when you want something big from the International Monetary Fund,"" Daniel Moss writes for Bloomberg Opinion. ""That's been true of IMF loans, generally, to emerging markets. And Argentina is into something big with the Washington-based lender. The country is looking for a top-up of its $50 billion credit line, and if President Mauricio Macri can demonstrate the country can pay its debts, then the interest rates demanded by investors should come down from their crippling levels."" Mr. Moss adds: ""A leader that turns to the IMF has to have economic officials who can disavow the past practices and oversee the required reboot. And thus the exit of Argentine Central Bank President Luis Caputo, who resigned Tuesday after a mere three months in the role. He pulled rates as high as 60 percent to try to steady the peso. That's firefighting, not something sustainable…IMF or no, Macri had to change course. No economy can survive interest rates that stratospheric. Let's hope he hasn't forced the wrong person overboard."" The Fault Lies in R-Star and in Ourselves Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell should question the whole notion that r-star--or the neutral real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive--has any significant practical use for the central bank, writes Kevin Warsh for The Wall Street Journal. ""In my view, r-star is not a beacon in the sky but a chimera in the eye,"" he writes. ""The idea of a ""neutral"" rate is a useful fiction. It makes for an interesting academic thought experiment. In practice, though, it's unobservable, unpredictable, imprecise and highly variable. That makes it a poor guide for policy makers."" U.S. consumer confidence hit a new 18-year high in September, a positive indicator for spending going into the holiday shopping season, as robust job growth and a strong economic outlook bolstered Americans' expectations for the future. U.S. home-price gains slowed for the fourth straight month in July, as higher mortgage rates begin acting as a brake on rapid price growth, offering some welcome respite for buyers. An index measuring manufacturing activity across the central Atlantic region expanded in September. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a report its composite manufacturing index rose to 29 in September from 24 in August. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 20 in September.--Dow Jones Newswires New Zealand business confidence jumped in September to its highest level since May, helping to ease what has become the biggest source of the worry for the economic outlook, and challenging the central bank's view that interest rates might soon need to be cut.

2018-09-26 10:49:00,Fed poised to raise rates for third time this year,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to raise interest rates for a third time this year and possibly modify the likely direction of rates in the months ahead. The big question is whether the strong U.S. economy, which has been fueled this year by tax cuts and increased government spending, could weaken next year, especially if President Donald Trump's trade fights begin to inflict damage and the benefits of tax cuts start to fade. If the Fed finds that prospect likely, it might signal Wednesday that it expects to slow its rate increases next year. The Fed's key short-term rate now stands in a range of 1.75-2 percent after two quarter-point increases in March and June. A similar rate hike Wednesday would raise that range to a still-low 2-2.25 percent.

UniCredit expects Italy's average monthly issuance at EUR17 billion in October and November, down from a monthly average of EUR20 billion in the year to date, she says. UniCredit expects the Italian treasury to cancel the mid-December bond auction, in line with previous years.

2018-09-26 06:02:00,"Clouds on horizon as trade wars, debt weigh on Asia's growth","BANGKOK (AP) — Trade conflicts, rising debt and the potential impact from rising interest rates in the U.S. will likely dampen growth in the coming year, the Asian Development Bank said Wednesday in an update of its regional economic outlook report. The Manila, Philippines-based regional lender said Wednesday that it expects economic growth in Asia to remain at a robust 6.0 percent in 2018 but to slip to 5.8 percent next year. China's economy is expected to expand at a 6.6 percent annual pace this year but slow to 6.3 percent in 2019. It cited looming financial and trade shocks as the biggest sources of potential trouble. If the U.S. economy shows signs of overheating, interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, including one expected Wednesday to take the benchmark rate to 2-2.25 percent, could disrupt currency markets and other capital flows, leading to problems with bad loans. Overly high housing prices also are risks for China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and South Korea, the report said. But it said the bigger threat comes from potential damage to supply chains caused by trade conflicts, especially between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump pushed ahead Monday with higher tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated by imposing penalties on $60 billion of U.S. goods. The conflict stemming from U.S. complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology, has the potential to shave 0.5 percentage points off of China's growth and 0.1 percentage points off of growth in the U.S., the report said. China and the United States earlier imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of each other's goods. Combined, the tariffs now cover nearly half the goods and services China sells America and nearly 60 percent of what the United States sells China. The damage will be worse if Trump carries out threats to raise tariffs on virtually all products imported from China, said the ADB's chief economist, Yasuyuki Sawada. But fast-growing Asia is quickly becoming such a large market that expanding trade within the region can help offset lost exports to the U.S., he said. ""Intraregional trade in Asia is as high as almost 50 percent of total t rade and this seems to be increasing over time,"" he told The Associated Press in a phone interview. ""Asia used to be a global factory and everyone viewed Asian economies as suppliers, but if we look, more than half of the global middle class is living in Asia."" Also, even if Trump's tariffs strategy succeeds in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, the ADB report said, the deficit with Asia overall is unlikely to decline so much because other countries would likely be exporting more to make up the difference. Efforts to forge regional free trade agreements are gaining momentum partly thanks to the U.S. moves, Sawada said. ""It's encouraging and very important to keep this momentum toward a more open trading system,"" he said. Still, the ADB report said that prolonged trade conflict would damage confidence and deter investment, both regional and globally, especially if it expands to include autos and auto trade. ""Estimates of impacts do not fully capture possible disruption to production units as overseas business networks are severed and investment plans are cancelled amid a reallocation of global production,"" it said.

1998-09-30 00:00:00,Fed Cuts Short-Term Rates by 0.25 Point --- First Cut Since January '96 Is a Pre-Emptive Strike To Stave Off Recession,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since January 1996 in a pre-emptive strike against recession that reflects a sudden reversal in the central bank's outlook for the economy and new worries about a credit crunch. The Fed trimmed its key short-term interest rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5.25%, saying it sought to ""cushion the effects on prospective growth in the United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies"" and offset what it termed ""less accommodative financial conditions domestically."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped immediately following the Fed's announcement at about 2:15 p.m., and closed at 8080.52, down 28.32. But bond prices jumped; the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32, or $7.1875 for a bond with $1,000 face value. The widely anticipated rate cut, already reflected in mortgage rates and other market-set rates, won't have much immediate effect on consumer-loan rates. But if commercial banks follow the Fed and cut their prime lending rates, that will mean lower interest charges on some credit-card loans and many home-equity loans. Among some traders and other Fed watchers there was disappointment that the Fed didn't, as some expected, cut rates by 1/2 percentage point. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for instance, described the move as ""underwhelming in its modesty."" But a few months ago, a rate cut looked very unlikely. Just last June, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan declared the state of the U.S. economy to be ""as impressive as any I have witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the American economy."" With the unemployment rate at a low 4.5%, Mr. Greenspan's colleagues at the Fed were far more worried about an outbreak of inflation than about recession. The last time the Fed cut rates with unemployment this low was 30 years ago, and inflation took off soon thereafter. What darkened Mr. Greenspan's crystal ball? Early signs of financial stress in the U.S., triggered largely by Russia's Aug. 17 default on its foreign debt and the resulting fear in financial markets of risky -- and even not-so-risky-loans and investments of all sorts. Fed officials worry that the seeds of a potentially strangling credit crunch have been planted in an otherwise healthy American economy. Though there's scant evidence of a slowdown in growth, yesterday's move, perhaps the first of a series, was an attempt to kill the weed before it takes root. As Mr. Greenspan put it last week, global financial turmoil has produced ""a general pulling back for risk-taking,"" which is showing itself in lower stock prices, higher yields on bonds of riskier companies and hints that banks -- an important source of finance to companies too small for public offerings -- are growing more reluctant to lend. In preparation for yesterday's meeting, the Fed conducted a special survey of senior bank lending officers; it hadn't planned such a survey until November. Results aren't yet public, but the survey apparently found some hints that bankers, too, were beginning to pull back. ""Banks are also reportedly becoming more cautious and more-expensive lenders to companies,"" Mr. Greenspan said last week. ""Banks are examining their exposures more carefully,"" and aren't as ""free-wheeling"" as they were,"" says David Bozynski, treasurer of Federal-Mogul Corp. When the Southfield, Mich., auto-parts maker borrowed more than $1 billion earlier this month, it had to pay 2.25 percentage points above the benchmark widely used by banks. Earlier this year, Federal-Mogul was able to borrow at 2 points above the benchmark. ""I'm hearing from my members that financial institutions are beginning to tighten their lending standards,"" says Barry Rogstad, president of the American Business Conference, a group of midsized, fast-growing companies. Fed fears that another rude shock to the financial system would produce even more reluctance to lend among bankers and bond buyers contributed to its decision last week to broker the $3.5-billion rescue of Long-Term Capital Management LP, the spectacularly leveraged hedge fund. Because growth has slowed so much outside of the U.S., hurting U.S. exports, and because of signs of credit tightening here at home, Wall Street analysts are marking down their forecasts for economic growth next year, and Fed staff economists have done the same. Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. projects that the U.S. economy, which grew at an eye-popping 3.6% adjusted for inflation over the past year, will grow only about 1% over the next 12 months. Goldman Sachs & Co. figures that stock and bond markets now put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at a substantial 40%. There are only few fresh indications that the economy may soon slow, and some analysts think that the Fed is making a mistake. After all, only a few months back, Mr. Greenspan was fretting about bankers being too lax. ""If the Fed eases now,"" says Roseanne Cahn, an economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., ""there's a risk that they will foster the next financial bubble, which is likely to be followed by a bigger crash later."" But such concerns were outweighed by the tightening of credit conditions, which could make it difficult for businesses to finance the investment boom that has sustained the economy for years. Most obvious is that the stock market's appetite for initial public offerings of shares has almost dried up, the latest casualty being Goldman Sachs & Co.'s celebrated planned offering. The end to the initial-public-offering boom ""is forcing us to slow our expansion, and to cut expenses more,"" says Gene McGreven, chairman of PetNet Pharmaceutical Services LLC, a two-year-old, Norcross, Ga., maker of cancer diagnostics. ""We would normally be making plans now to do an IPO six to nine months from now, but that would be a waste of time and effort,"" he says. Bond-market borrowing also has been hurt in the past six weeks. In the last half of 1997 and the first half of 1998, riskier companies sold an average of $589 million in high-yield bonds per day; since the beginning of August, they've been selling only about $162 million per day, he says, according to Moody's Investors Services. And even though yields on Treasury bonds are down, the rate that the bond market demands from junk-bond issuers has jumped to 10.5%, the highest level since early 1995. Bond issuance by blue-chip companies has also fallen, to $213 million per day from $714 million per day in the year ended July 31. And the spread -- the difference between the rates that the U.S. Treasury pays to borrow money and the rates that companies pay -- has widened, too, a measure that Mr. Greenspan and others at the Fed track closely as a gauge of credit conditions in the economy. Ford Motor Co., which has a solid A rating, last week had to pay 1.45 percentage points above Treasurys to borrow $1.5 billion for 30 years. That's about a third more than the premium Ford probably would have paid earlier this year, says Moody's chief economist, John Lonski. ""There appears to be an unusual and unwarranted risk aversion among lenders,"" he says. ""That's what happens with a credit crunch: tight standards are applied quite often without regard to the underlying creditworthiness of the borrower."" Shortly after the Fed announcement, the Bank of Canada cut its short-term rates by 1/4 percentage point to 5.75%, prompting major Canadian banks to trim their prime lending rates by the same amount. The Canadian central bank raised the rate to 6% at the end of August in an effort to stabilize the sinking Canadian dollar.",The Wall Street Journal
1998-09-28 00:00:00,"Whys, Wherefores of a Possible Rate Cut --- Easing of Monetary Policy Would Mark a Reversal In Fed's Basic Outlook","WASHINGTON -- Ever since Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan broadly hinted last week at an interest-rate cut, markets have treated a reduction as a near certainty when the Fed's policy makers meet here tomorrow. An easing of monetary policy would mark a swift and amazing turnaround in the central bank's fundamental economic outlook. For well over a year, the Fed's greatest concern has been inflation, not recession. As recently as July, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues agreed their next move was most likely a rate increase. Why would the Fed ease? The new dynamic since the summer has been continued deterioration in Asia's economies, and the disease's spread to Russia and Latin America, which takes more than 15% of U.S. exports. There has been, so far, minimal concrete evidence of a slowdown in the U.S., mainly a slump in manufacturing and a drop in corporate profits. But some early warning signs of deeper damage may be flashing, such as hints of eroding business and consumer confidence, especially as the stock market slumps. There are also fears of a looming credit contraction in the U.S. -- signaled by rising rates on junk bonds in recent weeks, and warnings by some banks of plans to curb lending. ""Issuance of equity, and of bonds by lower-rated corporations, has come virtually to a halt,"" Mr. Greenspan said in congressional testimony last week. ""Even investment-grade companies have cut back substantially on their borrowing in capital markets,"" he added. While growth through the rest of 1998 is likely to remain solid, the outlook for 1999 has become less certain. Would a rate cut be related to the near-collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management LP hedge fund? There would seem to be at least an indirect link. When the New York Fed brokered the deal to bail out the fund last week, spokesman Peter Bakstansky said officials moved because ""there was a potential for disruption in the marketplace."" Market weakness and volatility of recent weeks could put more financial firms under stress, and could jeopardize markets' workings. Just as Mr. Greenspan promised, after the 1987 stock crash, to provide the economy with sufficient liquidity, a rate cut could take some pressure off the market's weakest links. How big would a rate cut be? Usually, the Fed moves in increments of a quarter percentage point, which would put the federal-funds rate, the rate banks charge one another, at 5.25%. That would bring rates to early 1997 levels, before the Fed boosted rates a quarter-point on inflation fears. But many market participants are betting on a bigger cut, perhaps a half-percentage point, anticipating Mr. Greenspan will want to make a significant statement about his concern for the world's economic frailties. On Friday, investors in bond market futures contracts were treating a half-point cut by year's end as a certainty, and a half-point cut tomorrow as a reasonable possibility. What impact would a rate cut have? There would be some direct stimulus to the U.S. economy. ""When interest rates go down, mortgages are cheaper, capital for investment to business people is cheaper, the purchase of durables by consumers on credit is cheaper,"" Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin explained Friday on NBCTV's ""Today"" show. ""And all of that . . . increases economic activity."" Struggling Asian and Latin economies could also benefit from greater American consumption of imports. A cut in U.S. interest rates would also increase somewhat the availability of credit world-wide, easing the global credit crunch. It could also stabilize the destructive turmoil in foreign-exchange markets-investment capital flows to nations that offer high returns, so currencies of other countries tend to fall against the dollar when U.S. rates rise, and rise against the dollar when U.S. rates fall. Beyond any direct economic effect, the hope is for a huge psychological boost to investors, and that markets around the world would either rise or stabilize. The mere hint by Mr. Greenspan of a rate cut can send the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring hundreds of points. Latin American bonds rallied late last week in anticipation of a Fed move. Market stability could also reduce the possibility of other Long-Term Capital type crises. ""It could turn questionable loans into good loans, and prevent other questionable loans from becoming bad loans,"" says Princeton University economist Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman. But psychological boosts only work so long, short of fundamental changes in economic trouble spots. Japan must fix its banking system; Brazil's economy is still weak. ""A Fed rate cut gives Brazil two to four weeks, but it doesn't solve their problems,"" says Paulo Leme, director of emerging markets for Goldman, Sachs & Co. Is there any downside to a rate cut? The Fed risks reinflating the stock market bubble Mr. Greenspan so famously worried about in his December 1996 ""irrational exuberance"" speech. Meanwhile, the conditions that led most Fed officials two months ago to consider raising rates remain in place. Unemployment remains at 4.5%, near a quarter-century low, while wages continue to accelerate. Housing, one of the most interest-rate sensitive sectors, already is considered overheated and would get an unneeded stimulus from a rate cut. If fears of a slowdown turn out to be exaggerated, inflationary pressures would be fueled. But inflation remains so low-consumer prices have risen at just a 1.6% annual rate -- and the Asian crisis is pushing down import and commodity prices so much, that the risk of some extra inflation seems less worrisome than it did a few months ago. ""There's a risk of some incremental inflation from a Fed easing, but it could be taken back,"" says Chris Varvares, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in St. Louis. ""You have to weigh that against reducing the chances of a global meltdown."" What's the risk of not easing? Mr. Greenspan is a student of history, and he has studied with care the mistakes the Fed made before and during the Great Depression. No Fed official wants to be blamed for dithering while the world economy slid into recession -- or worse. Japan already has cut short-term rates to 1/4 %. Germany has made clear it isn't about to cut its rates. So the onus appears to be on the world's most powerful central bank, the Federal Reserve. Besides, a rate cut tomorrow is so widely expected, that a failure to do so would likely jolt fragile markets, at least for the day. ""The market would fall on its backside,"" says Dennis Hynes, managing director at R.W. Presspritch, a New York brokerage firm. ""If the Fed doesn't cut rates, the market goes down 300 points.""",The Wall Street Journal
