   LPFORT WORTH, Texas—Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Friday his "base case" scenario continues to be for a total of three—not four—interest-rate increases this year, because he thinks economic growth could begin to slow in 2019.

"We should be raising rates, but very gradually," Mr. Kaplan told a business luncheon in the north Texas city of Fort Worth, adding that such rate rises should nonetheless be done "steadily."
   TDThe Fed has increased its benchmark federal-funds rate twice this year, including a quarter-percentage-point rise announced Wednesday. That puts the rate into a range between 1.75% and 2%.

Fed officials' median projection released Wednesday was for a total of four rate increases this year, including their moves this week and in March, to keep the rapidly expanding U.S. economy from overheating. But Mr. Kaplan said Friday he is "still in for 3."

"For me, my base case is still three [rate hikes] for this year," he told reporters after the luncheon. "Having said that, I'm very open-minded about, when we get to the fall, being open to a fourth."

Mr. Kaplan added there is no "magical" formula for the correct amount of rate increases that should be done the year. "I think the key is that we're gradually moving toward a neutral stance."

The Fed official said U.S. economic growth is "very strong" this year, and said the jobless rate, now at 3.8%, is probably headed to "the middle 3s." But he said economic growth could begin to slow next year and longer term, making a more aggressive pace of rate rises unnecessary.

"I'm very mindful of the fact that part of the strength of the economy in 2018 is fiscal stimulus, and I'm also mindful that we expect that's going to fade to some extent in 2019 and further in 2020," Mr. Kaplan said.

 HDMONEY MARKETS-Dollar 3-month LIBOR falls for second day   WC393 words   PD15 June 2018   ET16:18   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPNEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - A benchmark of what banks charge each other for three-month dollars fell for a second day Friday amid falling interest rates on commercial paper issued by banks and a modest pickup in demand for them by money market funds.

The London interbank offered rate on three-month dollars fell 0.875 basis point to 2.32594 percent on Friday. It retreated further from a one-month peak of 2.34063 percent on Wednesday.
   TDLIBOR is a benchmark for $200 trillion worth of dollar-denominated interest rate swaps, loans and other products.

LIBOR's decline came even after the Federal Reserve's second interest rate increase in 2018 on Wednesday to a target range of 1.75-2.00 percent on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank signaled it will likely raise rates further on expectations of a tightening labor market and rising inflation.

While LIBOR tends to rise with the Fed's rate target, supply and demand for short-term bank debt also influence the rate benchmark, analysts said.

Banks have held down issuance of commercial paper (CP), or short-term IOUs to raise cash to fund their trades and loans, in the past couple of weeks before the Fed's latest rate increase.

"It's a drop in unsecured funding cost. There's been less CP supply," said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.

Bank commercial paper outstanding rose to $539.0 billion in the week ended June 13 on a seasonal adjusted basis, up modestly from the prior week's $534.8 billion but down from $553.5 billion two weeks earlier, Fed data showed.

Interest rates on three-month bank CP averaged 2.13 percent on Wednesday, the lowest since May 22.

On the demand side, assets of prime money market mutual funds, which are major CP holders, grew by $5.09 billion in the June 13 week, the Investment Company Institute said on Thursday.

It was too early to tell how much further LIBOR would fall as the government is expected to ramp up issuance of Treasury bills later this year to finance its spending and last year's tax cuts, Goldberg said. (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Bernadette Baum)

 CLMU.S. Markets   SEMarkets   HDU.S. Stocks Slide as Trade Tensions Heat Up; Investors fear the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods could spiral into a trade war   BYBy Akane Otani and Riva Gold    WC590 words   PD15 June 2018   ET23:09   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPThe Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest one-week slide since March, as mounting fears over a potential trade war sent shares of industrial firms lower.

After months of exchanging threats, the U.S. and China unveiled plans Friday to hit each other with tariffs on billions of dollars in goods.
   TDThe moves marked the latest deterioration of relations between the world's two biggest economies, something that has kept investors and analysts on guard in recent months.

Even as U.S. economic data have been relatively upbeat, with reports this week showing retail sales soaring and jobless claims falling, many remain wary of the possibility that restrictive trade policies could hit a wide range of industries and derail the global economy.

Those fears have capped investors' appetite for risk, many say, explaining why the stock market has struggled for momentum.

"For the first four months of the year, all of these threats were there, but no one really thought the clouds were going to materialize. Now we're back to the wall of worry," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 84.83 points, or 0.3%, to 25090.48 on Friday for a loss of 0.9% this week, while the S&P 500 fell 3.07 points, or 0.1%, to 2779.42 and rose less than 0.1% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite lost 14.66 points, or 0.2%, to 7746.38 but added 1.3% for the week, buoyed by gains in the technology sector.

Shares of agricultural and industrial companies, which some fear could be especially vulnerable to punitive trade measures from China, were hit by a fresh wave of selling.

Caterpillar slid $3.12, or 2%, to $150.02, while Boeing fell 4.54, or 1.3%, to 357.88, and United States Steel shed 1.57, or 4.2%, to 36.05.

Energy shares also tumbled as U.S. crude oil fell 2.7% to $65.06 a barrel and posted its fourth consecutive weekly decline, with some analysts attributing the selling to bets that major producers will decide to raise production next week.

Stocks elsewhere came under pressure, with the Stoxx Europe 600 down 1% as bank stocks fell alongside government bond yields.

Investors had sent the euro sharply lower and bought government bonds Thursday after the European Central Bank signaled that interest rates would likely remain unchanged at least through the summer of 2019. The ECB's move stood in contrast to the Federal Reserve's suggestion on Wednesday that it could pick up the pace of \b interest-rate\b0  increases this year and next.

The Fed's decision "was a great vote of confidence in the U.S. economy," said James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan decided Friday to stick to its ultra-easy monetary policy.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.5%.

 SEEconomy   HDEconomic Growth in U.S. Leaves World Behind; Second-quarter growth on track to exceed a 4% pace—the fastest of any quarter in almost four years   BYBy Jon Sindreu, Riva Gold and Josh Mitchell    WC1,056 words   PD15 June 2018   ET02:05   SNWSJ Pro Central Banking   SCRSTPROCB   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPThe U.S. economy is revving up just as Europe and other major economies lose steam, jeopardizing a rare period in which the world's largest economies have been accelerating in unison.

The European Central Bank on Thursday took another step toward ending the massive stimulus measures it has used in an effort to boost growth since 2015. But ECB officials also said they would hold interest rates steady through summer next year, a sign that they felt the eurozone economy remains fragile.
   TDIn an indication of growing economic vigor in the U.S., the Federal Reserve on Wednesday tapped the brakes again, raising the benchmark \b interest rate\b0  by a quarter of a percentage point and signaling it may quicken the pace of future rate increases because of a strengthening economy and tightening labor markets.

The economies' diverging paths were expressed most prominently in the euro, which on Thursday suffered its worst day against the dollar in two years. The euro lost 1.88% against the U.S. currency, its biggest drop since the day after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.

The central bank announcements over the past two days offered the latest evidence that heady growth expectations for Europe and other major economies outside the U.S. might not be achieved, defying analysts who began the year convinced that the world economy's first synchronized expansion in years would continue.

The International Monetary Fund said in January that the world's seven largest economies each grew more than 1.5% in 2017, and it predicted more solid growth this year. Global manufacturing was booming and the IHS Markit global purchasing managers index that month was its strongest in nearly seven years.

Many investors counted on a revitalized Europe to lead that growth in 2018. But recent labor strikes in France, political turmoil in Italy and softer economic data are causing investors to rethink that premise. Germany last week reported that factory orders dropped 2.5% in April, while eurozone growth was 0.4% in the first quarter, down from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2017. On Thursday, the ECB revised down its eurozone growth expectations for this year to 2.1%, from 2.4%.

"When we look at Europe, the very strong momentum we saw in data last year has been waning this year," said Holly MacDonald, chief investment strategist at Bessemer Trust.

Europe isn't the only region to show signs of cooling down. The People's Bank of China this week also left a suite of key short-term interest rates unchanged. New data showed business activity, including investment and retail sales, slowed in May, suggesting the world's second-largest economy is facing growing headwinds.

The disappointing figures "warranted China to take a cautious tone," said Tommy Xie, an economist at OCBC Bank.

In the U.S., meanwhile, recent data suggest an economic expansion that just became the second-longest in the nation's history is accelerating, rather than slowing down.

The U.S. economy grew modestly over the winter—at a 2.2% annual rate in January through March—but seems to be ramping up further this spring. Growth is on track to exceed a 4% pace in the three months ending in June, which would be the fastest of any quarter in almost four years.

Spending at U.S. retailers soared 0.8% in May, the biggest jump in six months, according to U.S. government data released on Thursday. Consumers, spurred by tax cuts and the lowest unemployment in half a century, shelled out more for cars, clothing, building supplies, health products and bar tabs.

"We may be entering a new level of consumer spending right now," said economist Robert Frick of the Navy Federal Credit Union. He pointed out that more and more blue-collar workers are finding work as the labor expansion endures, and those workers tend to spend a greater portion of their incomes, out of necessity, than higher-income workers, who save more.

He added that low unemployment, strong consumer spending and modest inflation are likely to keep the economy on strong footing this year: "We're in a Goldilocks zone right now."

In the eurozone, rates have stayed pegged at negative levels—now at minus 0.4%—since 2014. Despite some initial concerns, investors have become more relaxed about possible unintended effects of negative rates on the economy.

On Thursday, investors reacted to the ECB's announcement to end bond purchases while keeping rates low longer by selling the euro and bidding up stocks. It is the latest example of interest-rate moves returning to the driver's seat of monetary policy. In the wake of the financial crisis, central bankers rolled out a raft of unprecedented and complex measures, including bond buying and lending facilities for banks, pitching them as a way to lower long-term borrowing costs at a time when short-term rates could go no lower.

Not all investors are ready to write off Europe's growth prospects. Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at ?Société Générale, believes that lackluster economic data in the first quarter is a "temporary soft patch," and that "fundamentals remain very solid for eurozone growth," whereas he expects the U.S. economy to go into a recession around 2020.

Others believe the euro will continue to weaken further this year, but think that markets are swinging too far in favor of U.S. growth.

Next year, "we expect the euro to rebound against the dollar even if the ECB only hikes late in the year," said Ingvild Borgen Gjerde, an analyst at Capital Economics. "We think the Fed's tightening cycle will come to an end in mid-2019, far sooner than is discounted in the markets."

FORT WORTH, Tx., June 15 (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan on Friday said trade with Mexico and Canada boosts jobs in the United States, and warned that it will be difficult to solve problems that plague U.S.-China relations if trade frictions continue in North America.
   TD"We believe trade is an opportunity," Kaplan said, adding that there are some difficult issues related to technology transfers that make the China-U.S. trade situation different.

He also said his "base case" is still for one more interest-rate hike this year, even as most of his colleagues expect at least two more rate hikes, and reiterated his view the Fed should not raise rates so far that the yield curve inverses.

   LP1148 ET - European Central Bank policy isn't likely to affect the euro or EUR/USD in the medium term because the ECB committed on Thursday to not raising interest rates at least until after next summer, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Looking ahead, we expect relative data, trade policy and developments in Italy to be the main EUR/USD drivers," BAML says. "We remain bearish EUR/USD and would sell any rallies," BAML adds. EUR/USD is last up by 0.5% at 1.1623 after having fallen Thursday on the back of the ECB. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)
   TD1137 ET - Some European credit spreads have been distorted due to the European Central Bank's bond-buying program--which is now set to end after 2018--and don't show where debt levels pose a risk to creditors, Bank of America Merrill Lynch says. Monetary support has motivated either rapid asset price gains or debt accumulation, it says. "Many spreads have simply rallied through the QE and bond-purchase program era by default (and because of relative value) even when corporate leverage has risen." German Merck Financial Services, French hospitality firm Accor SA and Italy's gas transmission operator Snam SpA top the list of companies where credit spreads don't reflect the level of debt and where "idiosyncratic risk lurks for creditors". (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com; @lorena_rbal)

1051 ET - The European Central Bank achieved what seemed impossible: to announce the end of the quantitative easing and still manage to sound dovish, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. They add that the three-month extension of the asset purchases to year-end, at a monthly pace of EUR15 billion between October and December, "still leaves a small crack in the wall for an extension into 2019." However, the ECB's intention to keep rates low "through the summer" is still consistent with a September 2019 increase in the deposit rate, BAML says. It maintains its forecast for a 20 basis point increase in the deposit rate at that time. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

1042 ET - The third quarter could see EUR/USD trade in a range, with a greater risk of falls, after the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday, says FX Knowledge. The ECB's announcement that it won't raise interest rates until after summer 2019 leaves the euro vulnerable in the short-term, it says. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the ECB are now on different wave lengths, with the former continuing to increase rates. However, this is offset by FX Knowledge's continued expectation that "cyclical, structural and geopolitical" factors will help the euro going forward, given a solid eurozone economy and trade war risks. "Strong EUR macro indicators are now badly required for a revival to take place in Q3," it says.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

1018 ET - The fact that the European Central Bank announced plans to halve its bond-buying program from October and end it after 2018, and that it made this decision earlier than many had expected, leaves a "clear possibility" that Sweden's Riksbank could raise rates in December, says SEB. However, given the ECB pushed back investors' expectations of a first rate increase by saying rates will stay at current levels at least through next summer, SEB continues to expect the Riksbank will deliver a rate increase in April 2019. "For the time being, we maintain our forecast," it says. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0951 ET - The Swiss National Bank could raise interest rates before the ECB does next year, say analysts at Credit Suisse. On Thursday, the ECB said it didn't expect to raise its policy rates through at least the summer of 2019. But Credit Suisse expects the SNB to raise its deposit rate to -0.50% from -0.75% in the first quarter of 2019 and again to -0.25% in the third quarter of next year. "Assuming EUR/CHF trades above 1.10 by then, we believe that the SNB can raise its policy rate independently of the ECB," the analysts wrote. Euro trading at 1.1575 francs.

0951 ET - Asian currencies other than the safe-haven yen fall against the U.S. dollar on Friday, with USD/CNY rising 0.5% to 6.4304, the day when the U.S. import tariffs on Chinese products are due to come in force, and China is expected to retaliate. "A China announcement today will undermine confidence further and keep the emerging market foreign exchange market under downward pressure versus the U.S. dollar," MUFG says. "China is likely to respond in kind and would mean we would be just one announcement away from investors concluding a full-blown global trade war is a reality," MUFG adds.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0944 ET - The decisions made by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank this week show an "unusually clear outlook" for the future path of monetary policy in the two economic regions, say Erste Group analysts. While the Fed will keep raising rates for the foreseeable future, an initial change in interest rates is not even on the horizon for the ECB, they say. The ECB's commitment, even though subject to incoming data, "has erased the basis for interest rate speculation for the markets well into 2019, in our view," Erste says.

0942 ET - Foreign investors increased their holdings of Italian government bonds, known as BTPs, in March, having purchased around EUR23 billion in BTPs, UniCredit's deputy head of fixed income strategy Luca Cazzulani says, citing Bank of Italy data. "Actually, March saw one of the largest monthly inflows since the start of the QE," Cazzulani says. March was the month when Italy held elections resulting in a long political impasse. But it was also characterized by around EUR14 billion of positive net issuance and falling yields in the eurozone with stable BTP spreads following the Italian election, he says. The Bank of Italy's breakdown is useful in shedding some light on the subsequent sell-off, Cazzulani says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0858 ET - The European Central Bank announced it would halve its bond-buying program to EUR15 billion from October to December and stop buying bonds altogether after December because it had to, says Commerzbank. "The ECB would soon hold more than one third of bonds if it continued the purchases," Commerzbank says. It adds that the ECB "has probably got its timing exactly right for announcing the end of the asset purchasing programme without having to admit this problem openly."

0844 ET - Government-bond supply in the eurozone spreads from the two-year maturity to the 30-year segment. Slovakia on Monday plans to raise around EUR190 million in 2023 and 2037 bonds.

0841 ET - The euro fell on Thursday on the back of the European Central Bank monetary policy decision and Commerzbank says "there is no reason to expect a stronger euro." Thanks to higher oil prices, headline inflation in the eurozone has returned to 1.9%. But underlying inflation "has hardly picked up at all so far," says Commerzbank. "That is not going to change any time soon, which is why the headline inflation rate is likely to correct to the downside again towards year-end." This leaves no justification for the ECB to raise interest rates in the foreseeable future. On Friday, EUR/USD is volatile, but is last up 0.2% at 1.1592.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

 HDECB Decision to Keep EUR/USD in a Range in 3Q: FX Knowledge -- Market Talk   WC1,412 words   PD15 June 2018   ET16:42   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP1042 ET - The third quarter could see EUR/USD trade in a range, with a greater risk of falls, after the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday, says FX Knowledge. The ECB's announcement that it won't raise interest rates until after summer 2019 leaves the euro vulnerable in the short-term, it says. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the ECB are now on different wave lengths, with the former continuing to increase rates. However, this is offset by FX Knowledge's continued expectation that "cyclical, structural and geopolitical" factors will help the euro going forward, given a solid eurozone economy and trade war risks. "Strong EUR macro indicators are now badly required for a revival to take place in Q3," it says.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)
   TD1018 ET - The fact that the European Central Bank announced plans to halve its bond-buying program from October and end it after 2018, and that it made this decision earlier than many had expected, leaves a "clear possibility" that Sweden's Riksbank could raise rates in December, says SEB. However, given the ECB pushed back investors' expectations of a first rate increase by saying rates will stay at current levels at least through next summer, SEB continues to expect the Riksbank will deliver a rate increase in April 2019. "For the time being, we maintain our forecast," it says. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0951 ET - The Swiss National Bank could raise interest rates before the ECB does next year, say analysts at Credit Suisse. On Thursday, the ECB said it didn't expect to raise its policy rates through at least the summer of 2019. But Credit Suisse expects the SNB to raise its deposit rate to -0.50% from -0.75% in the first quarter of 2019 and again to -0.25% in the third quarter of next year. "Assuming EUR/CHF trades above 1.10 by then, we believe that the SNB can raise its policy rate independently of the ECB," the analysts wrote. Euro trading at 1.1575 francs.

0951 ET - Asian currencies other than the safe-haven yen fall against the U.S. dollar on Friday, with USD/CNY rising 0.5% to 6.4304, the day when the U.S. import tariffs on Chinese products are due to come in force, and China is expected to retaliate. "A China announcement today will undermine confidence further and keep the emerging market foreign exchange market under downward pressure versus the U.S. dollar," MUFG says. "China is likely to respond in kind and would mean we would be just one announcement away from investors concluding a full-blown global trade war is a reality," MUFG adds.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0944 ET - The decisions made by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank this week show an "unusually clear outlook" for the future path of monetary policy in the two economic regions, say Erste Group analysts. While the Fed will keep raising rates for the foreseeable future, an initial change in interest rates is not even on the horizon for the ECB, they say. The ECB's commitment, even though subject to incoming data, "has erased the basis for interest rate speculation for the markets well into 2019, in our view," Erste says.

0942 ET - Foreign investors increased their holdings of Italian government bonds, known as BTPs, in March, having purchased around EUR23 billion in BTPs, UniCredit's deputy head of fixed income strategy Luca Cazzulani says, citing Bank of Italy data. "Actually, March saw one of the largest monthly inflows since the start of the QE," Cazzulani says. March was the month when Italy held elections resulting in a long political impasse. But it was also characterized by around EUR14 billion of positive net issuance and falling yields in the eurozone with stable BTP spreads following the Italian election, he says. The Bank of Italy's breakdown is useful in shedding some light on the subsequent sell-off, Cazzulani says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0858 ET - The European Central Bank announced it would halve its bond-buying program to EUR15 billion from October to December and stop buying bonds altogether after December because it had to, says Commerzbank. "The ECB would soon hold more than one third of bonds if it continued the purchases," Commerzbank says. It adds that the ECB "has probably got its timing exactly right for announcing the end of the asset purchasing programme without having to admit this problem openly." (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0844 ET - Government-bond supply in the eurozone spreads from the two-year maturity to the 30-year segment. Slovakia on Monday plans to raise around EUR190 million in 2023 and 2037 bonds.

0756 ET - The prospect of the European Central Bank ending quantitative easing at the end of the year, which it announced Thursday, could lead investors to retreat from corporate bonds, says Marco Stoeckle, credit strategist at Commerzbank. The ECB buys corporate bonds as well as government bonds as part of its asset purchase program. Credit issuers are also likely to react by increasing issuance before "supply indigestion" kicks in, Mr. Stoeckle says, as the ECB's exit from asset purchases will mean the absence of a major buyer. "Markets have already started pricing a less bullish world with euro investment grade 25 basis points and euro high yield 75bp wider year-to-date," he says. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com; @lorena_rbal)

0731 ET - The Turkish lira continues to fall despite recent interest rates increases. Analysts say that even though Turkey's central bank pushed up rates to prevent lira from hitting new daily record lows, the country's trade deficit remains a major concern for investors. USD/TRY rose to a three-week high of 4.7602 and is last trading up 0.1% at 4.7286. Another reason behind lira's fall is the dollar's strength, with the U.S. currency up against most emerging-market counterparts. As the Federal Reserve raises rates, making U.S. yields more attractive, investors who previously fled into emerging markets to hunt for yield are returning to the U.S. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0729 ET - There is likely some volatility ahead for EUR/USD, says Societe Generale. The foreign exchange market as a whole, however, isn't likely to experience higher volatility, unlike other asset classes. "We expect the EUR/USD bullish trend to resume, but in a choppier way than previously, preventing volatility from falling in a very low regime. The spot should rather experience a succession of increasing ranges, generating gradually more volatility," SocGen says. EUR/USD is last up 0.2% at 1.1589, having fallen sharply on Thursday.

1128 GMT - Copper slips 0.2% to $7,149.50 a metric ton, with a cocktail of geopolitical and metals-specific factors eroding some of the metal's sharp gains of the previous week. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.1%, but has risen 1.3% over the past five days. A stronger dollar tends to make commodities denominated in that currency more expensive for holders of other currencies. That uplift for the dollar came after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and penciled in an additional rate rise for 2018. Analysts also put falls for most base metals down to a combination of lackluster Chinese economic data and U.S. President Donald Trump's approval of tariffs on about $50 billion of Chinese goods.

0957 GMT - A warning from the Bank of England over the risks to lenders from customers abandoning zero-interest credit-card offers earlier than expected should strengthen the hand of CYBG in its proposed takeover of Virgin Money, says Goodbody.

Goodbody says Virgin Money faces risks from "overly aggressive" interest assumptions, and CYBG may use the report as leverage in negotiations. (adam.clark@dowjones.com)

Beyond resulting in a growth slowdown, that will come as elder-related spending continually rises, putting a strain on public finances.

0820 GMT - The ICE Dollar Index, which weighs the greenback against 16 other currencies, hit fresh 2018 highs as European trading began before pulling back. Getting to 95.13, it was recently down around 94.90 to build on yesterday's post-ECB gains. As the ECB said yesterday it likely won't hike interest rates at least until after summer 2019, the Fed is now looking a potential 4 increases this year and 2-3 in 2019. Higher rates, which brings higher bond yields, are more attractive for investors. That makes them turn to buy more US assets with dollars, boosting the currency's value relative to others.

0811 GMT - UniCredit says its expectation for the first rate raise by the European Central Bank, in light of Thursday's decisions, may be too optimistic. "We now see increased risk that our forecast for a first hike in June 2019 might prove too bullish," its strategists say. The ECB announced a reduction of the monthly run rate of asset purchases to EUR15 billion starting October from EUR30 billion currently, and the winddown of the program at year-end. It also said it would keep interest rates at current levels through summer 2019. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0804 GMT - Some have been talking about the potential of an interest-rate hike in Thailand after tightening elsewhere in Southeast Asia the past few months. But Moody's Analytics sees the country's central bank remaining on hold at least through year-end, partly because inflation remains below policymakers' target. The firm adds domestic demand remains relatively subdued, with private consumption still restrained and private investment weak. The central bank next meets Wednesday.

0745 GMT - The margin for a rebound in the euro "has now become more constrained" after the European Central Bank monetary policy decision on Thursday, says UniCredit. But "this does not mean that it is necessarily over" and the ECB's negative impact on the euro "will progressively fade," it says. "The intentions of both the Fed and the ECB are now on the table and there is less surprise effect left going forward." Moreover, CFTC data shows investors have returned to being net sellers of the dollar. "One tailwind that has boosted the dollar since mid-April is thus probably gone." EUR/USD continues Thursday's falls, falling to a two-week low of 1.1543, according to Factset. It is last flat at 1.1570. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

   LPEuro selling extended into Asia on Friday after the European Central Bank said it would hold off hiking interest rates at least for another year, while equity traders were uneasy ahead of Donald Trump's decision on whether to hit China with fresh tariffs.

The single currency was hammered on trading floors after the ECB's announcement Thursday, which was accompanied by a cut in its eurozone growth outlook, citing rising protectionism and global trade fears.
   TDConfirmation that it would end its crisis-era bond-buying stimulus provided little support as that had been widely expected.

The news came a day after the Federal Reserve said it would likely hike US rates twice more this year and four times in 2019, highlighting an increasing divergence between the two.

The euro dived to $1.1580, from above $1.1800 earlier Thursday. And in early Asian trade the unit sank even further towards 10-month lows.

"The signals from the (Fed) and ECB couldn't be more different," said Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at OANDA. "The Fed, barring any unexpected financial market calamity, is primed to raise interest rate every quarter while the ECB will continue to sit on their hands well into 2019.

"These opposing views should see interest rates diverging more between the two most powerful central banks in the US's favour which should continue to lend support to the dollar. And should keep the Euro circling the drain well into the summer."

The news sent European stocks soaring as a cheaper euro boosts the bloc's exporters. But while the Nasdaq hit another record on Wall Street, US stocks were choppy as fears grow that Trump will on Friday announce tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports.

Those worries filtered through to Asia, where markets fluctuated. Tokyo ended the morning 0.4 percent higher and Sydney added more than one percent.

Hong Kong gained 0.1 percent and Wellington edged up but Shanghai lost 0.3 percent, Seoul dropped 0.5 percent and Taipei was also lower.

Trump is due to make a decision Friday, with many expecting him to push through the measures, with China threatening to retaliate in kind -- stoking fears of a trade war.

Tai Hui, JP Morgan Asset Management chief market strategist for Asia-Pacific, said that while a thumbs-up from Trump would not be a surprise, there were concerns that talks between the two sides have seen little progress.

He added that another worry Trump's threatened sanctions on Canada and the European Union.

The EU on Thursday approved a raft of tariffs targeting US goods.

Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, warned: "Implementation of the tariffs, when it occurs, could take us closer to a trade war."

The International Monetary Fund said the White House's import duties could harm the world economic recovery by "catalysing a cycle of retaliatory responses" and interrupting global supply chains.

 HDFed tweak shows difficulty of trimming balance sheet   BYRobin Wigglesworth in New York    WC836 words   PD14 June 2018   ET10:44   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

   LPCentral bank raises rate it pays on deposits a little less than would be customary

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday made a small, but important tweak to its monetary policy framework that offers a valuable clue to where the size of the US central bank’s balance sheet could be heading in the coming years.
   TDThe central bank raised its Fed funds target rate range to between 1.75 per cent and 2 per cent. But officials raised an interest rate it uses to control the Fed funds rate by just 20 basis points to 1.95 per cent, rather than the customary 25bp increment.

The change, while technical, might signal that the US central bank will not be able to shrink its balance sheet as much as commonly expected.

The rate that was tweaked, known as the IOER, or “interest on excess reserves”, is the interest the Fed pays on money held at the central bank, and has until now acted as the upper level of its corridor, while the “overnight reverse repo programme”, or RRP, has been the de facto floor for the Fed funds range.

The primary driver for this adjustment is that the effective Fed funds rate has recently drifted up towards the higher end of the Fed’s target range. Since it began raising rates in late 2015, the key rate has averaged about 10bp below the upper end of the corridor. But this year it has moved to just 5bp below the top of the range — a change that has vexed policymakers.

“They have been perturbed that it has drifted up from the central point of the corridor,” said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at Gam, a Swiss asset manager. “Central banks don’t want to be seen to not be in control.”

In a supplemental statement on Wednesday, the Fed said: “Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 5 basis points below the top of the target range for the Federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the [Fed’s] target range.”

The Fed funds rate has been nudged higher by the central bank, slowly draining “excess reserves” from the financial system, which has started to have a bigger than expected impact on short-term money markets.

The Fed has historically controlled the Fed funds rate by controlling how much money sloshed around in the Fed funds market. If it wanted to lift interest rates, the central bank sucked funds out by selling Treasuries it had in storage to commercial banks, and taking money out of their accounts at the Fed. When it lowered interest rates, it pushed money into the market by buying Treasuries from the banks.

But the Fed’s crisis-fighting quantitative programme entailed buying massive amounts of bonds from banks and crediting their accounts at the Fed with new money — flooding the financial system with surplus Fed funds and forcing the central bank to start using IOER and RRP to control the Fed funds rate.

Since last year, the US central bank has begun to gingerly shrink its balance sheet by gradually reducing how much of maturing bonds it reinvests in the market. As a result, the total assets held by the Fed has slowly dipped from about $4.5tn to $4.32tn as of last Wednesday.

Fed officials have remained silent about just how far it will shrink its balance sheet, but some economists and analysts say that the gradual rise in the Fed funds market could indicate that the “excess reserves” sloshing around the Fed funds market are not as abundant as previously thought. That could in turn mean that the US central bank will not be able to shrink its balance sheet as much as some had expected.

Some analysts were sceptical that the rise in the Fed funds rate had been driven by nascent tightness in the Fed funds market, arguing that other forces were at work.

Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI argued it was more likely driven by rising rates elsewhere — such as in the interbank money market and short-term Treasury yields — caused by a surge of Treasury bill issuance this year and US companies repatriating money held overseas, where much of it was lent to banks. Nonetheless, he too suspects the Fed’s balance sheet trimming would not be as sizeable as many have expected.

Seth Carpenter, chief US economist at UBS, estimates that the balance sheet would probably not go below $3.5tn, a level it will hit in mid-2020. But given that officials have indicated that they want to get the Fed’s holdings of mortgage-backed bonds to zero, that would mean that the Fed will actually have to start buying Treasuries again around then to counteract continued mortgage bond shrinkage.

“It could be even earlier, depending on where they want excess reserves to settle,” Mr Carpenter said.

   LPThe dollar was on track for its biggest one-day jump in 18 months as investors assessed the prospect of a bigger gap in interest rates between the US and European central banks.

The buck was a big winner against the euro, which was undercut after the European Central Bank said at its policy meeting earlier today it would end its €2.4tn bond-buying programme by the end of the year but signalled any rise in interest rate rises was unlikely before the end of summer 2019.
   TDThis is contrast to the Federal Reserve, which yesterday raised the benchmark borrowing rate and said it expected to lift interest rates a total of four times in 2018, one more than its previous forecast.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of international peers, rose by 1.1 per cent to 94.694 in afternoon trade in New York. That put it on track for its biggest one-day rise since December 15, 2016.

The ECB said that it would begin tapering its bond purchases in September to €15bn a month from €30bn at present before finally halting the quantitative easing programme at the end of next year.

The euro tumbled by around 2 per cent to $1.1603 on Thursday afternoon.

Also supporting the dollar, data showed US retail sales rose at their fastest pace in six months in May.

   LP? Quarter-point increase ? Two more moves forecast in 2018 ? 10-year Treasury yield rises

The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates by a quarter point and signalled that two more increases were likely in 2018 as policymakers gave a bullish assessment of the US economy amid accelerating growth and rapid job creation.
   TDThe Federal Open Market Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent, in the seventh increase of the current cycle. Interest-rate forecasts released by Fed policymakers pointed to a total of four rate rises in 2018, followed by another three in 2019.

The US stock market dipped 0.2 per cent on the news of the intention to raise rates another two times this year, on top of the two that came in March and yesterday. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 3 basis points to 2.97 per cent. The dollar climbed 0.4 per cent against the euro to trade at $1.174.

In a statement, the central bank dropped previous crisis-era assurances that it would keep rates below their longer-run norms.

"The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labour market conditions and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 per cent objective over the medium term," the Fed said. It added that risks to the outlook were roughly balanced.

The Republicans' $1.5tn tax cutting package and $300bn federal spending increase have fuelled a further pick-up in the US economy, overshadowing global hazards, including the risk of a Trump-induced trade war.

As a result Jay Powell, the Fed's chairman, has vowed to continue with the programme of gradual rate rises that the Fed kicked off in late 2015.

The Fed's statement suggested the central bank was increasingly confident about inflation, as policymakers dropped statements that they were carefully monitoring price readings.

Officials also ditched previous guidance that said rates would for some time remain at levels "expected to prevail in the longer run", in a sign they thought policy was heading closer to neutral. However, the FOMC retained its assessment that policy was "accommodative" — meaning rates were still low enough to support growth.

The rate rise was widely predicted by financial markets given the recent fall in unemployment to just 3.8 per cent and signs that inflation is moving closer to the Fed's 2 per cent target. In their latest forecast, Fed policymakers projected core inflation would rise to a median 2.1 per cent next year, slightly above the target, and stay there in 2020.

The question is how high the Fed will ultimately lift rates as it balances rapid hiring against disappointing wage and inflation readings. The Fed forecasts put the midpoint of its target range at 3.4 per cent in 2020, higher than the median prediction for the rate in the longer-run — unchanged at 2.9 per cent. Markets pages 21&22

 SEBusiness   HDTurkish lira leads EM declines as focus shifts to Fed rates and geopolitical risk   BYROGER BLITZ    WC552 words   PD14 June 2018   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   ED1; Usa   PG21   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

   LPCurrencies

Turkey's lira led a fresh retreat of emerging market currencies, reflecting investor nerves that the Federal Reserve will solidify the case for further US interest rate rises this year.
   TDThe lira dropped 1.7 per cent yesterday, trading close to TL4.70, erasing recent strength sparked by the Turkish central bank's rate rises, although it later recovered to TL4.6270.

Asian EM currencies also fell, including the Indian rupee, the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah, a surprise to some analysts in the aftermath of the US-North Korea talks which they saw as having reduced geopolitical risk in the region.

However, there were gains for the Brazilian real, the Russian rouble and the Mexican peso during US trading.

Even so, sentiment towards EMs has largely turned bearish in the second quarter after a strong start to the year. A combination of factors, including dollar strength, rising Treasury yields and risk aversion, has sullied the EM investment case, forcing hefty sell-offs on the lira, the Argentine peso, the real and the South African rand.

These currencies are regarded as particularly vulnerable because their countries nurse large current account deficits and suffer from inflation problems. Market attention on yesterday's US central bank meeting was focused on its commentary on the strength of the US economy and the likely rate path.

"The tide of easy [US] money is receding and periodic stress in emerging markets will be evident during the later stage of Fed tightening," said Jason Daw, cross-asset strategist at Société Générale.

Mr Daw added that while an EM-wide systemic crisis was unlikely, "certain countries will face greater challenges than others".

A succession of EM central banks have responded with higher interest rates to bolster their currencies. Argentina went further, winning a $50bn injection from the IMF, although renewed peso selling this week forced its central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market.

Investors had begun the year bullish about EMs because of improving fundamentals and synchronised global growth. TD Securities said its EM clients were "a bit shell-shocked" by EM foreign exchange moves and were concerned that volatility would persist. "While clients did not seem to be outright structurally bearish on EM assets, considering that the fundamental position is not as negative as it has been in recent years, the extent of EM volatility and a couple of very negative country examples (Argentina and Turkey) have investors questioning the potential for wider-spread longer-term issues," analysts at TD Securities noted.

However, the EM sell-off is seen by leading bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine as a buying opportunity. Predicting an end to the dollar's revival, Mr Gundlach told an investor webcast earlier this week that this was "an excellent time" to consider at least a partial return into EM bonds.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch's fund manager survey for June also revealed that Latin American respondents were less worried about dollar strength and US yields and more fixated on elections. Brazil and Mexico have upcoming presidential elections and fund managers were pessimistic about the chances of centre-right candidates succeeding.

 HDANALYSIS-Central bank withdrawal means tighter times ahead for borrowers   WC792 words   PD14 June 2018   ET22:35   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - With the world's two largest central banks now pulling back the economic props used to battle multiple crises, a so-far sturdy global recovery faces a new challenge as rising interest rates begin to take hold.

For U.S. consumers, home mortgage rates already have risen enough over the last few months to offset the extra cash the average family could expect from recently enacted tax cuts, a potential drag on the consumer spending that continues to power the U.S. recovery. Credit card and auto loan rates are also rising.
   TDGlobally, emerging markets that racked up debt in an era of cheap money now face a turning point as global capital that had been attracted there by higher returns moves elsewhere.

The European Central Bank on Thursday said it would scale back its longstanding asset purchase program in September and end it in December, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved its seventh rate increase since 2015 and outlined plans for steady rate rises to come. The Fed is also drawing down its $4 trillion portfolio of bonds, putting further pressure on interest rates.

While the ECB has pledged not to actually raise its target interest rate for more than a year, the global shift in central bank policy is starting to be felt.

The roughly 0.65 percentage point rise in the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage since last summer means an increase of $95 in the monthly payment on a $250,000 loan, about as much as the typical family received in extra take home pay after the tax cut.

Overall mortgage originations were down 3 percent through the start of 2018 on an annualized basis, while applications for mortgage refinancing were the lowest in a decade.

New vehicle sales have fallen steadily since September, from 18.9 million cars and trucks to 17.3 million in May. Overall consumer credit in April grew the least amount since last fall as well, expanding $9.2 billion compared to an average of more than $14 billion per month over the last five years.

After keeping rates low and flooding markets with trillions of dollars in asset purchases, "the story now is coordinated central bank tightening and exit," said Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. "The big danger point comes, in the absence of (quantitative easing) as a buffer, longer term yields can go a lot higher, quicker. There is a lot of uncertainty about what longer term funding costs will do."

Italy's shaky politics and quick spike in interest rates recently were a reminder of the troubles the euro area could still face if financial conditions tighten, Brooks said, while rising debt levels in countries like Brazil and Turkey echo the emerging market traumas of the 1990s.

ECB President Mario Draghi and Fed chair Jerome Powell were careful to note this week that monetary policy remains supportive of spending and investment. Financial conditions on the whole remain loose, according to measures like the Chicago Fed's Financial Conditions Index.

But, Powell noted, the day is approaching when that will no longer be the case. In perhaps a year, given the outlook outlined by Fed policymakers on Wednesday, the Fed's short-term policy rate will hit "neutral," or a level that neither encourages nor discourages economic decisions.

"We know that's coming, we kind of don't think it's here yet, but...it's certainly coming," Powell said.

Add upcoming ECB actions to the mix, and 2019 could be the year when central bank policy tightens the screws after years in which the Fed's initial rate increases had little impact.

Rates may already be approaching the point where they begin sapping growth over the next year as households and businesses cut back, analysts from Capital Economics said in a recent analysis

In past central bank rate increase cycles, "rising real rates eventually led to a drop in rate-sensitive spending, including on durable goods, residential investment and inventories...This time is likely to be no different."

"As far as the Fed knowing exactly where 'too far' is, they don't have the precision," particularly at a time when most economists agree that key variables like the neutral rate of interest have fallen, said Tara Sinclair, a senior fellow and economist with the job site Indeed.com.

With wage growth still muted, higher consumer interest costs and stronger price inflation means Fed policy "is close to biting," she said.

 HDFed Lifts Rates as Economy Heats Up --- Increase is second this year; most central bank officials expect at least four in 2018   BYBy Nick Timiraos    WC863 words   PD14 June 2018   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA1   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials signaled Wednesday they could pick up the pace of interest-rate increases this year and next to keep a rapidly expanding economy on an even keel.

Central bank officials voted unanimously to raise their benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range between 1.75% and 2%. It is their second rate rise this year, and they penciled in a total of four increases for 2018, up from a projection of three at their March meeting.
   TD"The decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape," said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting. "Growth is strong. Labor markets are strong. Inflation is close to target."

Eight of 15 Fed officials now expect at least four rate increases will be needed this year, up from seven in March and four in December.

Stocks fell as investors calculated higher borrowing costs could weigh on earnings. Major stock indexes were little changed ahead of the decision but later wobbled and closed near session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 119.53 points, or 0.5%, to 25201, and U.S. government bond yields climbed after the decision, with the 10-year Treasury rising to 2.979% from 2.959% on Tuesday. Yields rise as prices fall.

"One more person out of 15 now sees four hikes instead of three. For markets, that's a big deal. For economists, maybe not," said Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Fed officials have upgraded considerably their economic outlook over the past year -- first because of a synchronized upturn in global growth beginning last summer, and later after Congress approved stimulus in the form of tax cuts and increased federal spending.

Other changes in the Fed's outlook Wednesday were relatively minor and paint an optimistic picture for the U.S. economy despite some recent risks from abroad, including trade tariffs and volatility in emerging-market economies.

"It's a stay-the-course story," said Roberto Perli, an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro. Because it is too soon to judge how much any of the international risks pose to U.S. growth, "they are right to take a wait-and-see approach here," he said.

Most Fed officials expect the central bank will need to raise rates at least three more times next year and at least once more in 2020, leaving rates in a range between 3.25% and 3.5% by the end of 2020, the same end point officials projected in March.

"Officials seem more comfortable about both the consequences of past actions and their policy intentions," said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE, the German insurance giant.

The new interest-rate guidance shows the U.S. central bank sticking to a plan to raise short-term rates above a so-called neutral level that would neither stimulate nor slow the economy. It also suggests officials expect to reach that neutral level slightly sooner than before, most likely in about a year.

In a further reflection of the Fed's changing policy footing, the postmeeting statement dropped language added four years ago that said officials expected to hold their benchmark rate "for some time" below neutral.

Officials modified their economic forecasts slightly, projecting modestly stronger growth and inflation this year and lower unemployment than they had in March. They didn't change their view about the rates of growth, unemployment or inflation they expect over the long run, a sign they see most of the recent fiscal stimulus fading eventually.

Mr. Powell also said he expected temporary factors, such as a recent rise in oil prices, to push inflation above the Fed's 2% target this summer, but he dismissed the development as a short-lived one.

Their estimate of the neutral fed-funds rate didn't change compared with projections released in March. Nine of 14 officials put it at either 2.75% or 3%.

The increase announced Wednesday will leave the fed-funds rate around 1 percentage point below that neutral level. But because many officials expect they will need to raise rates above neutral to a level that would slow growth, they face difficult debates ahead over how much higher to lift rates, and at what pace.

The challenge for central bankers is to boost borrowing costs enough to prevent the economy from overheating, but not so much that it tips into recession.

These are very different tensions than the one the Fed faced in recent years, when it repeatedly delayed raising rates from near zero amid a fitful U.S. recovery and financial turbulence abroad.

"I would say I like the results so far," said Mr. Powell. "We've been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly . . . We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I'm really glad we didn't."

    GLOBAL - European stocks jumped more than 1 percent on Thursday, while the euro

 HDEurope, Fed moves show global shift away from cheap money   BYBy DAVID McHUGH    CRAP Business Writer   WC1,067 words   PD14 June 2018   ET20:14   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPRIGA, Latvia (AP) — Two of the globe's most powerful central banks are gradually withdrawing the easy money policies that helped repair the damage wrought by the Great Recession and push stock markets to record highs. It's a sign of confidence in the economy, but with uncertain consequences for consumers and businesses.

As growth picks up in the U.S. and Europe and more people finding jobs, the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve are deeming it unnecessary to support the economy with policies created in darker days of financial uncertainty.
   TDThe ECB on Thursday said it would phase out by the end of this year its bond-buying stimulus for the 19 countries that use the euro. It had deployed the program in 2015 to save the region from the risk of falling prices and growth, and as Greece's debt crisis raised questions about the euro's future.

The move came less than a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this year on Wednesday, reversing rate cuts it started making almost ten years ago during the financial crisis.

"We are in an altogether different world to only a couple of years ago," said Patrick O'Donnell, senior investments manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

The central bank moves, he said, are "another step on the way to removing the extraordinary global monetary stimulus over the last decade."

The ECB's bond purchases were a way of pushing newly created money into the economy. That sought to lower borrowing rates and improve growth and inflation. The ECB wants inflation at just under 2 percent, and the last figures show it at 1.9 percent — technically in line with the goal, but the ECB must also be sure inflation will stay high when stimulus is removed.

The ECB's 25-member governing council said Thursday that the bond purchases would be cut to 15 billion euros ($17.7 billion) a month in October, from the current 30 billion euros. The purchases would then be wound up completely after December.

The bank was careful to stress that it would withdraw support for the economy only gradually, saying its key interest rate would not rise from its record low of zero until at least the summer of 2019.

That means it will be years before monetary policy and interest rates return to more historically normal levels. The goal: avoid a sharp rise in market rates like one that occurred in 2013 when then-Fed chief Ben Bernanke mentioned withdrawing stimulus.

However gradual, the exit is nonetheless a milestone for the eurozone economy, which recovered more slowly from the Great Recession than the U.S. Unemployment in the U.S. is 3.8 percent, less than half the eurozone's 8.5 percent.

Both the ECB and Fed moves will allow market borrowing rates to rise gradually. That could make loans somewhat more expensive for homebuyers and companies looking to invest. But it could also increase returns for savers and make it easier for pension savings to grow.

The ECB's effort in recent years to drop those borrowing rates has had its critics in some parts of Europe, especially Germany, who said it harmed savers and reduced the incentive for indebted governments to repair their finances by lowering borrowing costs. ECB President Mario Draghi says the bank's policy of easy money has helped create millions of new jobs, with unemployment falling from over 12 percent during the crisis.

There's little doubt, however, that the ECB stimulus program has helped heavily indebted countries like Italy borrow at unusually cheap rates. Its 10-year bonds yield only 2.76 percent despite sluggish growth and a government whose officials have in the past speculated about leaving the euro. US. 10-year Treasurys yield 2.95 percent.

Italy is in focus in Europe at the moment after a populist government came to power. A coalition between the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-immigration League has promised spending that could add to the country's already heavy debt load. At various times the parties have also questioned Italy's membership in the euro, though the finance minister this week calmed markets by saying the country has no intention to leave.

The Fed has already ended its own bond-buying program, which had similar goals, and has made seven interest rate increases to the current policy rate of 1.75-2.0 percent. At that, the Fed is also moving gradually; with core inflation at 2.2 percent in May, and headline inflation at 2.8 percent, the U.S. central bank benchmark is only around zero in real terms, when inflation is taken into consideration.

The stimulus on both ends was unprecedented in size. The Fed purchased some $3.6 trillion in bonds, while the ECB will have loaded 2.6 trillion euros ($3.1 trillion) of bonds on its balance sheet, in both cases a measure of the total size of the banks' stimulus efforts. All that money flooding into the financial system through banks pushed up the prices of investments likes stocks and bonds. The Dow and Germany's DAX both touched record highs earlier this year.

As the stimulus is ended and then withdrawn over a period of years, those effects will go into reverse, though investors do not seem too worried just yet: the DAX rallied 1.7 percent on Thursday.

 HDAs Fed raises rates, popular bond index funds get pinched   BYBy STAN CHOE    CRAP Business Writer   WC856 words   PD14 June 2018   ET19:47   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPNEW YORK (AP) — For holders of bond funds, the Federal Reserve is providing a reminder that even those buttoned-down, conservative investments carry some risk.

Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point Wednesday. The central bank also said it may raise rates two more times this year, a faster pace than it indicated a few months ago.
   TDWith interest rates on the rise, the prices of bonds siting in funds' portfolios could drop because they suddenly look less attractive than newly issued bonds. Even if the fund doesn't sell the bond, and thereby avoids locking in the paper loss, its share price will drop. The largest bond mutual fund dipped 0.1 percent on Wednesday and has lost 2.4 percent so far this year.

Bond funds have grown in popularity as aging populations seek a steady source of income with less risk than stocks. Bond funds that track indexes are particularly in favor because they carry significantly lower fees than managed funds and have a solid track record.

One way to measure how much pain a bond fund will incur is by looking at something called its "duration." This number shows roughly how big a loss to expect if interest rates climb by one percentage point.

The duration for the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index, which is the benchmark for some of the biggest bond funds and ETFs, hit 6.1 at the end of the first quarter. It's been marching steadily higher after sitting at 5.3 five years ago and 4.4 a decade earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute.

But not every bond fund is seeing its potential riskiness increase as much.

"The only ones that are lengthening are index funds, the others are fairly flat," said Sean Collins, chief economist at the Investment Company Institute.

While index funds that track the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate have seen their durations extend by 15 percent over the last five years, the average taxable bond mutual fund's has moved up to just 4.1 from 3.9. Narrow the focus to only high-quality, investment-grade bond funds, and the average duration has remained flat at 3.

It's a result of how bond fund managers have adjusted their portfolios due to worries about rising rates. To protect themselves, many have stuck with shorter-term bonds, which typically get hurt less by rising rates than the longer-term bonds that dominate the broadest indexes.

That means investors who ditched their actively managed bond funds for index bond funds in recent years may also have raised their susceptibility to a rise in rates. Last year, investors poured $210 billion into taxable bond funds that track indexes, versus $179 billion for actively managed ones, according to Morningstar.

Of course, some analysts have been warning for years that interest rates were set to skyrocket and send bond funds to big losses, only to see rates stay low. Aging populations around the world are hungry for income, and their resultant demand for bonds has helped to keep prices high and rates low.

Plus, not all bond index funds have the same amount of duration. Investors can control how much interest-rate risk they want by moving to short-term bond index funds.

Interest rates have been climbing fairly steadily since last autumn, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury sat at 2.98 percent on Wednesday. Economists at Deutsche Bank expect it to hit 3.25 percent by the end of the year. Goldman Sachs strategists predict the yield will hit 3.60 percent by the end of next year.

If rates rise in a gradual way, bond index funds could still come out OK. Even though prices would be dropping for the bonds in their portfolios, they could eventually offset those losses with the additional income they'd be getting after buying higher-yielding, newly issued bonds.

In the meantime, bond index funds will likely continue to have the advantage when it comes to fees. Bond index funds kept just $7 of every $10,000 invested last year to cover their expenses, compared with $55 for actively managed bond funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.

So, bond index funds will still hold onto their benefits, even as rates rise, but their risks will also grow. It's just another reminder that no investment is perfect, or perfectly safe.

Even bonds, the buttoned-down and conservative part of any portfolio, carry their own risks. And some of the most popular types of bond funds can be particularly susceptible to them.

 HDUS long-term mortgage rates jump; 30-year at 4.62 percent   WC394 words   PD14 June 2018   ET17:53   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates jumped this week after two straight weeks of declines, reaching their second-highest level this year.

Against a backdrop of rising interest rates in the economy, long-term loan rates have been running at their highest levels in seven years. And the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time this year and signaled that it may step up its pace of rate increases.
   TDMortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages was 4.62 percent, up from 4.54 percent last week. By contrast, the 30-year rate averaged 3.91 percent a year ago.

The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans increased to 4.07 percent from 4.01 percent last week.

The average 30-year mortgage rate reached a high this year of 4.66 percent on May 24; the 15-year rate hit 4.15 percent that day.

Freddie Mac chief economist Sam Khater said the impact on consumers of the Fed's rate hike will be smaller than in its rounds of rate increases in past years. He noted that a much smaller portion of mortgage loans now are tied to changes in short-term interest rates — adjustable-rate mortgages now account for only 8 percent of loans, as opposed to 31 percent in 2004-06.

"Still, inflation continues to firm and borrowing costs are inching higher," Khater said.

To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week.

The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. The average fee on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 0.4 point from 0.5 point last week.

The fee on 15-year mortgages was unchanged at 0.4 point.

The average rate for five-year adjustable-rate mortgages jumped to 3.83 percent from 3.74 percent last week. The fee declined to 0.3 point from 0.4 point.

   LPKRAKOW, Poland, June 14 (Reuters) - Wednesday's interest rate hike in the United States will not have an immediate impact on the cost of servicing Poland's debt, but the Federal Reserve's policy tightening may influence it in the longer term, the Polish finance minister said on Thursday.

"We have 30 percent of public debt denominated in (foreign) currencies. For now interest rates hikes in the United States are not noticeable for us, but in the long term this may have an impact on the cost of servicing that part of the debt," Teresa Czerwinska told reporters.

The Fed's Estimate Of Long-Run Unemployment Makes No Sense

The last time the unemployment rate was at 4.5% was in March 2017, more than a year ago. Since then, it has come down to 3.8% and will likely continue falling in the months to come.

Meantime, inflation has shown no signs of accelerating rapidly. In fact, it weakened through the spring and summer of last year. The economy at large doesn't appear to be overheating despite robust hiring in a tight job market.

And yet Federal Reserve officials think 4.5% is the natural rate of unemployment, that is, the lowest it can go without risking a damaging burst of inflation. That is according to the projections they released following their policy meeting Wednesday.

Frankly, that is hard to believe. If they were correct in their estimate of the natural rate, we would have seen threats of economic overheating by now.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested as much in his press conference.

"It may be" that the actual natural rate of unemployment is lower than 4.5%, he said. "You can't be too attached to these unobservable variables," he said. He might have shrugged.

In February, during a congressional appearance, Mr. Powell offered his own personal view of the natural rate of unemployment: "I'd say it's somewhere in the low 4's but what that really means is it could be 5 and it could 3.5"

So why haven't officials brought down their long-range forecasts for unemployment?

One answer could be that unlike their projections for the next three years – which can be tested against real data in the future – there is no way of determining whether officials' long-range forecasts are anywhere near the mark. That might give them a little less incentive to change their forecasts in the face of new evidence.

Fed-watchers and investors parse these Fed economic forecasts very closely. But these puzzling long-term unemployment forecasts suggest we do so at our peril.

Key Developments Around the World

Fed Raises Interest Rates, Sets Stage for Two More Increases in 2018

The Federal Reserve said it would raise interest rates by another quarter-percentage point and signaled it could lift them at a slightly faster pace this year to keep a strengthening economy on an even keel. The latest increase, the second this year, will bring the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 1.75% and 2%. Officials penciled in a total of four rate increases for this year, up from a projection of three increases at their March meeting. "The economy is doing very well," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the meeting. "Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low."

 Parsing the Fed: How the June Statement Change From May 

 ICYMI: Live Blog Recap 

Fed Adjusts How It Raises Short-Term Rates to Keep Them Anchored

The Fed on Wednesday tweaked the way it raises short-term interest rates to keep them from floating too high. The change, announced after the conclusion of the central bank's two-day policy meeting, is aimed at better anchoring short-term rates that are surging, primarily because of increased Treasury bill issuance.

Key Takeaways From Fed Day

The Fed raised short-term interest rates for the second time this year and projected two more rate increases by year's end, while Mr. Powell expressed optimism about the U.S. economy and said he would begin holding more news conferences starting in 2019. Here are five takeaways from the Fed meeting.

ECB Seen Signaling the End of Bond-Buying Program

Thursday could mark the end of an era for the European Central Bank, or at least the beginning of the end. The central bank for the eurozone—the second-largest economic bloc after the U.S.—could Thursday signal the winding down of its €2.5 trillion ($2.9 trillion) bond-buying program. This is a keenly anticipated move that would draw a line under a controversial crisis-era stimulus tool and start the clock on interest-rate hikes, following the path of the Federal Reserve.

China's Push to Tame Debt Starts to Sting Economy

China's economy is starting to feel pain from Beijing's monthslong effort to curb debt, with business activity slowing and the central bank deciding to not follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in adjusting interest rates. Across the board, business activity from investment to retail sales slowed in May, official data released Thursday showed, suggesting that the world's second-largest economy is facing growing headwinds.

When the Fed Speaks: Arguments, Emotions, and the Microfoundations of Institutions

The more the Federal Reserve's chairperson "discussed taken-for-granted assumptions underlying the monetary policy framework, the more this actually created uncertainty in the broader financial market," Derek Harmon found in an article for the journal Administrative Science Quarterly. "This market reaction is also influenced by emotions present at the time of the speech that shape how the event is interpreted. Speeches conveyed in an overall more positive tone suppress this reaction, while more fear in the business media amplifies it. Moreover, supplementary analyses conducted on speeches during the financial crisis suggest that when the taken-for-grantedness of these assumptions has weakened, reaffirming them no longer creates uncertainty to the same extent," he writes.

Japanese Banks and Negative Interest Rates

Japanese deposit takers responded to the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy by increasing credit and their appetite for risk, according to an analysis by Gee Hee Hong and John Kandrac published by the International Monetary Fund. "We find that banks responded to the prospect of a NIRP-induced profit shock by broadening their appetite for risk, which included an increase in credit supply," they write. "Consequently, our results demonstrate that the transmission of monetary policy through banks is preserved when nominal rates are negative. However, central banks that are concerned about the extent of risk taking in the banking system may find reason for caution in our results."

The Fed's Statement Was Short, but It Wasn't Sweet

The Fed "lopped off 80 words of longstanding language from its postmeeting statement which discussed how rates were ‘likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run,'" notes Justin Lahart for The Wall Street Journal. "This amounted to policy makers saying they don't expect to keep leaning with the economy, and that maybe they will need to start leaning against it." Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's announcement that the Fed will hold a press conference following each of its policy meetings is one step toward this possibility, Mr. Lahart says: "This will make it easier for the Fed to raise rates at any meeting, rather than just the four each year that are accompanied by news conferences."

Greg Ip's Analysis: What To Do With an Overshoot

"The \b Federal Reserve\b0 's dilemma is intensifying: when has the economy had too much of a good thing?" writes Greg Ip for The Wall Street Journal." "In forecasts released at the end of their meeting Wednesday, Fed officials again raised their projections for economic growth, and lowered their projections for unemployment," Mr. Ip notes, adding the Fed also raised its median forecast for inflation in 2018, 2019 and 2020. "For these projections to make sense, Fed officials must either raise their inflation target, assume some serendipitous boost to the economy's potential growth rate or decline in the natural unemployment rate, abandon their economic models, or run much tighter monetary policy, especially after 2020. For now, this last option seems the likeliest."

A gauge of U.S. business prices rose in May, the latest sign that inflation pressures in the economy are firming as the U.S. faces increasing tariff threats and a tightening labor market.

    By Karen Rodrigues
    BENGALURU, June 14 (Reuters) - Gold hit a two-week high on
Thursday, supported by a weaker dollar and trade worries between
Washington and Beijing, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve
forecast a slightly faster pace of interest rate hikes this
year.
    Spot gold        rose 0.3 percent to $1,302.50 per ounce at
0744 GMT. It earlier hit a high of $1,303.38 an ounce, its best
since May 31.
    U.S. gold futures         for August delivery rose 0.4
percent to $1,306 per ounce.
    Dollar is under pressure, so gold is doing well this
morning, a Hong Kong-based trader said.
    The dollar index       , which measures the greenback
against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.4 percent
at 93.388.        
    "Reports that President Trump was preparing to put tariffs
on billions of dollars of Chinese goods as soon as Friday raised
concerns in the market that economic growth would be impacted.
This saw some safe-haven buying emerge," ANZ said in a note.
    U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his top trade
advisers on Thursday to decide whether to activate threatened
tariffs on Chinese goods.             
    "Investor demand was also supported by a slightly weaker
U.S. dollar in the wake of the Fed decision to raise interest
rates," ANZ said.
    The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday,
and signalled two additional hikes by the end of this year,
compared to one previously.             
    "It (rate hike) is all priced in and obviously there are a
lot of uncertainties looking past this which is supporting gold
prices in our view," said Richard Xu, a fund manager at HuaAn
Gold, China's biggest gold exchange-traded fund.
    "Its muted response to the Federal Reserve increase is
because a lot of safe haven demand is going to take place... The
trade war drama is not going to end anytime soon, it is probably
going to be exasperated over the next month or so."
    Meanwhile, China's central bank left borrowing costs for
interbank loans unchanged on Thursday, an unexpected decision
that shrugged off the U.S. Federal Reserve's increase in its
benchmark rate overnight.             
    The decision came as China reported "shockingly weak"
activity data for May.             
    Markets are now looking forward to policy announcements from
the European Central Bank (ECB) later in the day where the bank
will debate whether to end its huge asset purchases by year-end.
            
    In other precious metals, silver        climbed 0.6 percent
to $17.09 an ounce, having earlier hit $17.14 an ounce, its
highest since April 20.
    Platinum        was 0.5 percent higher at $903.20 an ounce,
while palladium        gained 0.2 percent to $1,010.85 per
ounce.

 HDDollar Fails to Benefit From Fed Because of US Protectionism: LMAX Exchange -- Market Talk   WC1,311 words   PD14 June 2018   ET10:48   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP0848 GMT - The U.S. administration's protectionist platform only works with a weaker dollar, says LMAX Exchange, as it should encourage competitiveness. That's why the dollar hasn't benefited from the fact that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. In an email, Joel Kruger, its currency strategist, says: "The U.S. administration has imposed its will on currency traders over the past several months through the introduction of a protectionist platform that encourages soft dollar policy." He adds: "This...seriously undermines prospects for any meaningful U.S. dollar appreciation, even in the face of more hawkish-leaning Fed guidance." EUR/USD rises 0.3% to 1.1826. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)
   TD0846 GMT - European shares fall as a hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve and downbeat Chinese economic data dampened sentiment ahead of the European Central Bank rate decision. The Stoxx Europe 600 drops 0.6%, or 2.34 points, at 385.91 with all major national indices in the region down. Industrial-software company Aveva Group is the top pan-European riser, up 12% after reporting higher adjusted earnings. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0811 GMT - Germany's consumer prices rose to 2.2% on year in May from 1.6% in April to reach a high since February 2017, the Federal Statistical Office says, buoyed by energy prices. May's inflation rate rise was in line with the expectations of analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal. Energy prices jumped 5.1% on year in May, on the back of a spike in prices of heating oil and motor fuels, while food prices rose an above-average 3.5%. Services rose less than goods, the office said, climbing by 1.9%. The data comes ahead of the ECB's interest rate decision at 1145 GMT. (donatopaolo.mancini@dowjones.com; @donatopmancini)

0810 GMT - The recent slowdown in some activity data and the re-intensification of the "trade war" debate have clouded the outlook for the eurozone economy, says Luigi Speranza, BNP Paribas' head of European economics. But growth in the region remains solid and evidence is building that inflation has now turned the corner, he says. The ECB announces a decision at 1145 GMT, with the press conference following at 1230 GMT. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0759 GMT - It remains to be seen whether the European Central Bank will deliver precise details of its plans for what it will do once its current quantitative easing program ends in September at its meeting on Thursday, or whether it will wait until July. But BNP Paribas, which says a decision today looks "somewhat more likely," expects this will make no difference to what it decides regarding QE and interest rates. It expects QE to continue at a reduced pace for one more quarter into year-end, the first rate increase in mid-2019, and the deposit rate to be taken to zero by end-2019. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0756 GMT - EUR/GBP is likely to go above 0.8840 on Thursday even though there is a high chance that U.K. retail sales will come in strong due to warm weather, says ING. That's because the European Central Bank's monetary-policy decision should push the euro higher, the Dutch bank says, adding "we'd prefer to back the euro on the ECB." According to a WSJ poll, retail sales are projected to come in up 2.2% year-on-year for May. EUR/GBP is flat at 0.8819. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0743 GMT - The dollar falls Thursday, despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to 2% on Wednesday and projecting two more rate rises this year. EUR/USD is last up by 0.2% at 1.1815 and USD/JPY is down by 0.2% at 110.05. "The Fed was undoubtedly hawkish in our view," says RBC, who explains that the fall in the U.S. currency "underlines how tricky people are finding it to take big directional bets." President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are due to come in force on Friday, but there is a possibility he may opt to delay them, says RBC, leaving some investors confused about how to trade the dollar. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0731 GMT - With the Federal Reserve projecting one additional rate rise for 2018 and increasing the rate to 2% on Wednesday, the European Central Bank has "the green light" to be hawkish as well, says RBC. The ECB's "version of hawkishness," however, will be a "much-watered down version." ECB members have hinted that an end to the quantitative easing may be discussed on Thursday. RBC expects the timing of when QE will end will be debated at this meeting, with a decision likely in July. The euro may be pushed higher by the ECB's staff forecasts, in particular the 2020 inflation forecast, RBC says. EUR/USD is last up by 0.1% at 1.1811. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0722 GMT - Transforming their domestic retail operations is a key issue for French banks, Goldman Sachs says, after its recent European Financials Conference, where BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole were present. The banks' plans focus on two key issues, GS says: "On the one hand, optimizing processes to minimizes human intervention as well the need for physical branches, and on the other hand, investing in a more segmented client offering." (pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com; @pietrolombard10)

0714 GMT - A noticeable slowdown in the eurozone's economic dynamics and a series of uncertainty-generating factors may prompt the European Central Bank to hold back on any concrete decisions until its July meeting, say HSBC analysts. These factors include the trade conflict with the U.S. and the political situation in Italy, they say. While HSBC doesn't expect a decision on the future of asset purchasing at the upcoming meeting, their base case scenario is a one-time extension of asset purchases until year's end, with the monthly run rate to be reduced to EUR10 billion in October. The ECB buys EUR30 billion of assets a month. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0659 GMT - Even though European Central Bank chief economist Peter Praet recently hinted that there may be a debate over the future of the asset-purchases program at the upcoming meeting, any decision at this stage isn't a done deal. DZ Bank says the recent turmoil in Italy and trade issues with the U.S. may warrant some caution from ECB President Mario Draghi. "The latest political turbulence in Italy and the ongoing trade spat rather suggest that Team Draghi will adopt a wait-and-see stance," DZ Bank says. DZ Bank's analysts say they see a "tangible road map" for the unwinding of QE only being presented at the July meeting. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0656 GMT - KBC Bank's analysts expect the European Central Bank to prepare markets for the end of the asset purchase program at the end of this year, they say ahead of the central bank's rate decision and President Mario Draghi's press conference. "We expect the central bank to take the next step in its normalization process by mapping the end of its asset purchase program," they say. This symbolic move to policy normalization might support further euro gains, KBC's analysts say. EUR/USD last trades up 0.1% at 1.1808. The ECB announces a decision at 1145 GMT, with the press conference following at 1230 GMT.(emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

 HDStocks Finish Lower After Central Bank Decision -- WSJ   BYBy Jon Sindreu and Danielle Chemtob    WC954 words   PD14 June 2018   ET08:32   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   PGB11   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPThis article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (June 14, 2018).

U.S. stocks slid Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it would raise interest rates and pencil in a fourth rate increase for this year.
   TDMajor indexes were little changed ahead of the decision but later wobbled and closed near their session lows.

The Fed raised interest rates by another quarter-percentage point, bringing the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 1.75% and 2%. Eight of 15 Fed officials now expect at least four rate increases will be needed this year, compared with seven officials at the March meeting.

"It's hard to interpret it as all that hawkish when you consider it was just one official changing their interest-rate forecast," said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 119.53 points, or 0.5%, to 25201.20, while the S&P 500 fell 11.22 points, or 0.4%, to 2775.63. Both indexes posted their largest one-day point and percentage declines this month.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 8.09 points, or 0.1%, to 7695.70, its second-highest close in history.

U.S. government-bond yields climbed after the decision, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.979% from 2.959% on Tuesday. Yields rise as prices fall.

Concerns about monetary stimulus ebbing have joined worries about politics and trade tensions this year, creating a more-volatile environment for markets. For many investors, the key to interpreting these moves is how much longer the economy can keep powering ahead before a new recession kicks in.

"The easy-money policies that really drove this bull market are effectively over," said Craig Birk, executive vice president of portfolio management at Personal Capital, "That doesn't mean the market can't continue to advance, but it just no longer has that tailwind."

The biggest risk, said Jeff Mills, co-chief investment strategist for PNC Financial Services Group, is inflation increasing at a faster rate than the market and the Fed are expecting.

The Labor Department on Wednesday said the producer-price index, a measure of prices from the perspective of businesses, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in May from the previous month, above the expected 0.3%. Producer prices increased 3.1% from a year earlier, the largest annual increase since January 2012. Consumer-price index data, released Tuesday, showed a 0.2% increase in prices last month.

"The Fed might be accused of being slightly behind the curve, but with inflation at these levels I suspect they are going to run the economy a little bit hot," said Patrick Spencer, Baird's vice chairman of equities. "The Fed has to be careful because it regulates the banks and doesn't want to have a banking industry dealing with an inverted yield curve."

Shares of financial firms in the S&P 500 jumped after the Fed decision but later turned lower with the broader market. Higher interest rates typically widen the spread between what banks charge on loans and what they pay on deposits.

Stocks that investors consider bondlike took a hit alongside Treasury prices. The S&P 500 real-estate sector, which includes real-estate investment trusts that often suffer when interest rates rise, fell 2.3% -- extending declines. Shares of utilities fell 0.3%.

The European Central Bank is set to follow Thursday with its own policy meeting. Investors will try to gauge the exact time when eurozone officials will end their bond purchases -- a move broadly anticipated for later this year -- and whether Italy's political woes are likely to delay their plans.

So far, the ECB has signaled that it remains undeterred.

"It would be remiss of them to reverse any signal they've given," said Richard Hodges, a bond-fund manager at Nomura Asset Management. "They are running out of assets to buy, so if you gave a short-term fillip to Italy, this would raise longer-term concerns about financial stability."

The Bank of Japan will make its monthly policy decision on Friday.

Investors have also reacted positively to a federal judge's ruling that AT&T can proceed with its planned acquisition of Time Warner, seeing it as a sign that the field is clear for other corporate mergers to happen. Shares of Time Warner jumped $1.73, or 1.8%, to $97.95, while AT&T fell 2.13, or 6.2%, to 32.22, its largest percentage decline in nearly 10 years. After markets closed, Comcast offered to buy a chunk of 21st Century Fox's entertainment and international assets for roughly $65 billion in cash, setting off a bidding war with Disney.

Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.2%. Chinese bourses closed lower, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing 1.2% and the Shanghai Composite falling 1%. Both were pressured by shares of ZTE, which plunged about 40% -- an $8 billion wipeout -- on their first day of trading after nearly two months. The selloff reflected investors' unease about the future of the Chinese telecommunications company in the face of crippling U.S. sanctions.

By contrast, investors have mostly shrugged off this week's landmark summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, which was seen by analysts as inconclusive.

   TD

BEIJING--China's statistics bureau said Thursday that the country "has the conditions" to maintain steady economic growth in the second half of the year.

The impact from the U.S. interest rate increase on China's economy should be limited in the short term as the Federal Reserve's move was within expectations, spokesman Mao Shengyong told reporters at a briefing.

Infrastructure investment will probably come under pressure, but property investment is likely to keep growing steadily, while manufacturing investment is expected to stabilize and recover, Mr. Mao said.

Recent economic indicators haven't shown signs that economic growth was hit by trade frictions and in fact "we can't completely rule out trade frontloading that might have pushed up exports in recent months," he said.

Business activity in China slowed across the board in May, official data showed Thursday, suggesting the world's second largest economy is facing growing headwinds.

 SENews   HDUS Fed Low-rates guidance shuffles towards retirement   BYSAM FLEMING    WC870 words   PD13 June 2018   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   ED1; Usa   PG2   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

   LPAccelerating growth and blockbuster hiring numbers will keep the US Federal Reserve on a steady path towards tighter monetary policy this week despite global risks including the threat of a Donald Trump-induced trade war and emerging market strains.

The target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be lifted by another quarter point, bringing rates to 1.75-2 per cent, in the seventh rise of the current cycle. One or two further increases will be signalled for the remainder of the year, with more to come in 2019.
   TDWith the US central bank moving borrowing costs closer to a neutral level, and many officials signalling they expect policy to be pushed further to restrictive levels, Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, could start phasing out the low-rates guidance the central bank deployed during the crisis.

What is the Fed thinking? Officials appear upbeat and with good reason. Tracking estimates for secondquarter growth point to a marked acceleration from the first quarter's respectable 2.2 per cent annualised rate. The Atlanta Fed's regular estimate of gross domestic product is signalling expansion of as much as 4.6 per cent for the April to June period.

Unemployment has fallen to 3.8 per cent, far below the Fed's 4.5 per cent estimate of its sustainable level. Core inflation is getting nearer to target after repeated disappointments last year.

Adding zest to the rebound is a fiscal stimulus package that twins $1.5tn of tax cuts with a $300bn rise in federal spending, boosting the growth rate of real GDP by about 0.75 per cent this year and next. The stock market is resilient despite the potential shocks stemming from Mr Trump's hostile words towards the US's closest allies and willingness to slap tariffs on Canada and the EU.

What are the Fed's policy plans? Barring a shock, the Federal Open Market Committee will vote to lift rates from the current range of 1.5-1.75 per cent today; markets are pricing a 94 per cent chance of a rise, according to CME Group. The central bank will at the same time forge ahead with its plans to reduce its multitrillion-dollar balance sheet.

The real question hinges on the central bank's interest rate forecasts, released at the same time as its statement at 2pm US eastern time, and the tone struck by Mr Powell in a press conference half an hour later.

Many analysts expect the Fed to lift its median forecast for year-end rates, pencilling in two more increases in the second half of the year, taking the total to four. Goldman Sachs analysts predict three further rises in 2019, given "mounting evidence" the US is overshooting full employment. Some officials have been suggesting the central bank is ultimately likely to push rates beyond neutral, the level that neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back. The most recent set of forecasts from the Fed put the federal funds rate at 3.4 per cent in 2020, above the estimated long-run level of 2.9 per cent.

How will the statement change? The Fed is unlikely to signal a particularly aggressive rates outlook, and it will remain wedded to the wording on "gradual" increases it has offered in previous guidance. That is in part because wage growth has been slow to pick up even as unemployment tumbles. The central bank has also been signalling it will be comfortable if inflation overshoots its inflation target for a while.

But some changes to the statement are nonetheless possible today, or later this year. The existing assurance to markets that the federal funds rate will stay for some time below longer-run levels is now looking "stale", according to Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, meaning it will probably be retired soon. Michael Feroli, US economist at JPMorgan Chase, said such a change could be read either as dovish — given it suggests the Fed is now close to neutral, which could signal a pause — or as hawkish because it suggests the Fed is preparing communications for when policy gets restrictive. Given it will not be that long before rates touch their short-run neutral level, the Fed may also consider tweaking or ditching its statement that policy is "accommodative" — although it is not clear that this will happen as soon as today. More broadly, the Fed's statement has become cluttered and a broader tidy-up is overdue.

In the past, the Fed has used its statements to flag up risks brewing abroad, but it seems unlikely to sound an alarm this week. That does not mean there are no clouds on the horizon. Trade is among the threats on the Fed's radar, given the danger of further tit-for-tat escalation from Mr Trump's protectionist measures. Emerging market vulnerabilities are another, given the possibility of capital flight driven by tightening monetary policy in the US and euro area. Ms Brainard said at the end of last month that the risk of a "broader pullback" needed watching. Trump trade war page 9 Smart Money page 11

 SEEconomy   HDFive Takeaways From the Fed Meeting; Fed leader stresses the U.S. economy ‘is in great shape' and he wants to see more evidence inflation will remain on target   BYBy David Harrison    WC839 words   PD13 June 2018   ET23:50   SNWSJ Pro Central Banking   SCRSTPROCB   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPThe Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time this year and projected two more rate increases by year-end, while Chairman Jerome Powell expressed optimism about the U.S. economy and said he would begin holding more press conferences starting in 2019. Here are five takeaways from the Fed's June meeting.

The Economy Is Doing Really Well
   TDIf there was one simple message that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell wanted to convey Wednesday it was that the U.S. economy is doing well. "The U.S. economy is in great shape," he said in his postmeeting press conference. "Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to our target." Economists at the Atlanta Fed estimate the economy could grow at an annualized rate of more than 4% in the second quarter, the highest since 2014. And the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8%, the lowest level in 18 years. Inflation, meanwhile, remains under control and there are no signs for now of new financial bubbles forming. For Mr. Powell and his colleagues at the Fed, the goal is to keep the momentum going.

More Powell Pressers

To better communicate with the American public, Mr. Powell said he would begin holding press conferences following every Fed meeting beginning in January, rather than only at every other meeting. The move was expected. Mr. Powell took pains to note that his decision to speak more often shouldn't be read as a sign that the Fed intends to pick up the pace of rate increases, an interpretation made by some in the markets. "Having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes," he said. "This change is only about improving communications."

No Victory Parade Just Yet

Inflation has hit the Fed's 2% target for the past two months after undershooting it for much of the past six years. That is good news for Fed officials who were puzzled why inflation was so weak despite solid growth in the economy and the labor market. But Mr. Powell said two months isn't enough to make Fed officials rest easy. "The recent data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory," he said. Officials want to make sure inflation is around 2% "on a sustained basis," he added. That doesn't mean the Fed would try to tamp down inflation should it go above the 2% target for a little while. In fact, Mr. Powell said higher oil prices could well push inflation above 2% temporarily without prompting much Fed response. "That transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years."

Fed Path Still Gradual

The main headline out of this meeting was the fact that officials now pencil in four rate increases in 2018, up from three. But don't read too much into that change. The message from the central bank is that officials still expect to gradually raise interest rates as the economy improves. Should economic conditions change, they could decide to move faster or slower. "We've been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly," Mr. Powell said. "That patience has borne fruit." The Fed chief said officials have come under pressure in recent years to move faster as the economy has improved "and I'm really glad we didn't."

Tax-Cut Effects Still TBD

It has been almost six months since President Donald Trump signed the tax cuts into law. But it is still too soon to assess how successful they will be, Mr. Powell said. Theoretically, the tax cuts should boost overall demand in the economy, encourage businesses to invest and encourage more people to work, the Fed chief said. But the magnitude and the timing of those effects are uncertain, he said. Fed officials see the tax cuts as contributing to a 2.8% growth rate by the fourth quarter of the year, but their long-term growth projections remain around 1.8%, not far from where they have been for years. That suggests officials expect tax cuts to deliver a temporary boost and then fade. "You have a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be," Mr. Powell said. "They could be large. We hope they're large. But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see."

 HDBREAKINGVIEWS-Fed steps closer to horns of  interest-rate  dilemma   WC523 words   PD13 June 2018   ET20:18   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LP(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Gina Chon
   TDWASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Federal Reserve is nearer to taking the interest-rate bull by the horns. The U.S. central bank raised rates again on Wednesday as expected. Low unemployment and building inflation will force the Fed to consider how high it should go to prevent overheating – a shift from worrying about keeping rates low to support the economy.

The Fed is finally close to reaching its dual mandate of full employment and price stability, as defined by its target inflation rate of 2 percent. America’s jobless rate, at 3.8 percent, is at a 17-year low. Inflation has been edging higher. The headline personal consumption expenditures price index reached a 2 percent pace in March and April. In May, the consumer price index went up at an annual rate of 2.8 percent.

With the economic recovery in its ninth year, the Fed’s latest rate hike is the seventh since it started very cautious increases in December 2015. The range for the overnight rate is now between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. The Fed increased its projections from one to two more quarter-point hikes this year, and meanwhile it’s also shrinking its holdings of bonds.

The Republican tax cuts that went into effect this year are producing at least a temporary boost to the economy. That stimulus will probably lead to a modest inflation overshoot beyond the Fed’s target, according to Barclays research. And the job market is still hot. There are more openings than people counted as unemployed: 6.7 million versus 6.35 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s the first time the United States has reached such a milestone.

Trade wars are a complicating factor. On Friday, President Donald Trump’s administration could announce more tariffs on imports from China, spurring further tit-for-tat retaliation. Talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement are also in a bad spot. The Fed also can’t ignore possible negative effects on the domestic economy if jitters in emerging markets turn into more meaningful volatility.

Overall, though, the U.S. economy no longer needs a jolt. Instead, it is in danger of becoming overcharged – if trade spats don’t reverse economic gains. The Fed’s era of easy money is giving way to more of a balancing act.

 SEEconomy   HDTranscript: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's Postmeeting Press Conference; Central banker discusses monetary policy, financial regulation, introduces press conferences after every meeting starting in 2019   WC9,027 words   PD14 June 2018   ET00:32   SNWSJ Pro Central Banking   SCRSTPROCB   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell held his second press conference as central bank chief on Wednesday, June 13, 2018, shortly after the central bank announced another \b interest-rate\b0  increase and more to come in the years ahead. He discussed the economy, monetary policy and financial regulation and said he would start holding press conferences after every Fed meeting starting in January. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.

JEROME H. POWELL: Thanks very much for being here. I know that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today. And I'm happy to do that in a few minutes. But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are trying to do and why.
   TDThe main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well. Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low. Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis. For the past few years, we've been gradually raising interest rates. And along the way, we've tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions. In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level, as the economy strengthens, is the best way the Fed can help sustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive.

Today we've taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting. We don't put our interest-rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways. History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes. We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we're likely to do and why.

To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change. As chairman, I hope to foster a public conversation about what the Fed is doing to support a strong and resilient economy. And one practical step in doing so is to have a press conference like this after every one of our scheduled [Federal Open Market Committee] meetings. And we're going to do that beginning in January. That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions. I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes. This change is only about improving communications.

My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule. Now, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic projections, and our policy decision.

Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounce back in household spending. Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable.

Several factors support this assessment. Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative. These observations are consistent with the projections that committee participants submitted for this meeting. The median projection for the growth of real [gross domestic product] is 2.8% this year, 2.4% next year, and 2% in 2020. Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed.

In the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer-run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce. The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8% in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades. Meanwhile, the labor-force-participation rate has been roughly unchanged since late 2013. That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate. And we expect the job market to remain strong.

As you can see in our summary of economic projections, the median of committee participants' projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6% in the fourth quarter of this year, and runs at 3.5% over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate. This median path is just a bit lower than that for March.

After many years of running below our 2% longer-run objective, inflation has recently moved close to that level. Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures, increased 2% over the 12 months ending in April. The core-PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8% over the same period. As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation.

The recent inflation data have been encouraging. But, after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory. We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2% longer-run goal on a sustained basis. As we note in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2% objective.

Of course, many factors affect inflation, some temporary and others more lasting. And, at any given time, inflation may be above or below 2%. For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely push inflation somewhat above 2% in coming months. But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years.

The median of participants' projections for inflation runs at 2.1% through 2020. Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next.

As I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary-policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing it to 1¾ to 2%. We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting that policy normalization is proceeding broadly, as we have expected.

None of these changes signals a change in our policy views. For example, we removed the language stating that, quote, "the federal-funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run." Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened and the committee has raised the federal-funds rate from near zero to 1¾ to 2%.

As we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate. As a result, if the economy evolves broadly, as we anticipate, the federal-funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long-run level. Therefore, we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement.

We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal-funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor-market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2% goal.

We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion. Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective.

The committee's gradual approach is reflected in participants' projections for the appropriate path for the federal-funds rate. The median projection for the federal-funds rate is 2.4% at the end of this year, 3.1% at the end of 2019, and 3.4% at the end of 2020. By 2020, the median federal-funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run level. These projections are very similar to those made in March. Although the median federal-funds rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections.

And I'll conclude by mentioning two additional matters. First, our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly. Barring a material and unexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink. As we have said, changing the target range for the federal-funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.

And finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we're making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy. To keep the federal-funds rate in the target range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate. Up until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal-funds rate. In recent months, the federal-funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short-term interest rates have risen more generally. So, to move the federal-funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate five basis points below the upper end of the target range.

This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal-funds rate or financial conditions more generally.

Thanks for listening, and I'll be happy to take your questions.

Q: Jim Tankersley, New York Times.

I have a question about inflation and a question about growth. On inflation, I'm curious if there is anything that's happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come.

And on growth, you mentioned fiscal policy is adding to growth. And I'm curious if you could break that down a little bit further for us and say what effect do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth.

MR. POWELL: Sure. So since—I wouldn't say anything has happened since March to really change the way I'm thinking about inflation or the way the committee is thinking about inflation. We've seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2% objective. And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation down. Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.

So we continue to think and the committee continues to think that we are just about at our 2% goal but, as I mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven't done yet.

You also asked about fiscal policy. And there is a range of views on the committee and, I think, more broadly a range of views among economists generally. But I can say that committee members, committee participants generally believe that the fiscal changes—and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years.

And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side? So it is—it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates and allow faster expensing of investment, you will encourage greater investment, that should drive productivity, that should increase potential output. So that really ought to happen as well. I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain.

There's also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain.

So that's how the committee generally is thinking about that fiscal policy.

Q: Nick Timiraos, The Wall Street Journal.

So the Fed is about four interest-rate increases, using the projections released today, away from what might be considered a neutral fed-funds rate. And I wanted to ask how you're thinking about what to do once you get to neutral. Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it's OK to stop raising rates? And under what conditions would you want to keep going?

MR. POWELL: So for many, many years, we've been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been—has been clear.

As the economy has strengthened and as we've gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, "how much longer will you need to be accommodative and how will you know? How will you know at what point policy will be neutral, neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it?"

So we know that we're getting closer to that neutral level. We don't have an exact sense of how that will be. So the committee is discussing very actively the questions that you raise. And really, it boils down to a question of, "what is appropriate policy?" And, you know, you've asked, "how will we know?" So I think we'll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings and on the labor market.

We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment, but also what is the neutral rate of interest. What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down? So I think we'll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move forward.

Q: Howard Schneider with Reuters.

Two-point-one percent—above target—for 2½ years starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed here, be it price-level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2. In deciding how symmetric is too symmetric, what sort of parameters are you using on that front?

MR. POWELL: You know our target for our medium-term objective for inflation is 2% PCE inflation. We feel that that target has served the economy well. And I'm strongly committed to it. The committee is strongly committed to it. The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be very high because, again, we think it's fundamental and we think it's worked.

You asked about price level targeting and that sort of thing. You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower, we're near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we're going to be down at the zero lower bound, and therefore sort of undermine the credibility of the 2% inflation objective. So the idea is to have kind of a makeup. If you're below target for a while, you have a time of being above target. And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2% target. This is an idea that's been written about for many years. It's not something that the committee has looked at seriously. I imagine we will be having discussions about it, but not something that we have on the calendar right now.

Q: Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.

Over the weekend we saw some significant tensions within the G-7 in Canada. There is the potential obviously for further action against China right now, retaliatory action from major U.S. trading partners. How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy? And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate-investment intentions? Is this something that's beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies? Thanks.

MR. POWELL: I ought to start by saying that, you know, Congress has assigned us very important jobs and, you know, maximum employment, stable prices. We have a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies. Congress has very specifically given authority over trade to the executive branch. So I wouldn't comment on any particular specific trade actions.

I will say that we of course have—we have broad contacts among business leaders around the country, and the Reserve Bank presidents in particular have that, and so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting. And they do come back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are rising, I think it's fair to say, and also that you're beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people. So right now we don't see that in the numbers at all. The economy is very strong. The labor market is strong. Growth is strong. We really don't see it in the numbers. It's just not there. But so I would put it, then, as more of a risk.

Q: Steve Liesman, CNBC.

Mr. Chairman, you said there is a difference of opinion among economists. But looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the committee, there's not a whole lot of difference. It's 1.8 to 2 or 1.7 to 2.1, depending upon how you count it. Is that showing us that not a single member of the committee, including yourself, Mr. Chairman, agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long-run sustained growth rates above or at 3% or higher? Do you believe in that?

MR. POWELL: You know, first of all, that's a reasonable range, I think. It's not that we're all on the same number, but there are a range of views about potential growth. And there's so much uncertainty around this. You know, we don't—the thing about fiscal policy is, you don't have thousands of incidents to—you know, to—you don't have big data, in a way. You have very small data. You've got only a few instances here. So you have a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be. They could be large. We hope they're large. But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see, and hope that in fact we do get significant effects to—you know, to potential growth out of a tax bill. And we're just going to have to see. I think we're looking at a reasonable range of estimates and we're putting—different participants are putting different estimates in, and we're going to be waiting and seeing.

Q: Donna Borak with CNN.

You said earlier that it's still a little too early to declare a victory on inflation. I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what does the Fed say in regards to the inflation target is symmetric? Like, has the committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it would be rising above, whether it goes higher than 2.1 if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long? And now that you're planning to hold these regular press conferences starting next year, how do you explain—how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not overrunning?

MR. POWELL: You know, what we've said in our statement of longer-run principles and monetary-policy strategy is that the committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2%—persistently above or below 2%—and that's what we mean by symmetric. We're looking at it equally on either side and it's a matter of persistent overruns.

We know that inflation is going to bounce around. For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there's a good chance that headline inflation will move up above 2% because of oil prices. Things buffet inflation back and forth but so we acknowledge that. We understand that, and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2%, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target.

We do understand, though, that we don't have the ability to precisely hit that target. So we expect that inflation will be above or below, and we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis.

Q: Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.

At this meeting, you [inaudible] right. You changed the dot plot to move from three to four [rate increases] for this year and you took out a sentence that you had been using for years about how long rates might stay low, but you say that none of this signals a change in policy views. But shouldn't we see from this combination of things that the Fed is moving to a tighter policy?

MR. POWELL: I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing to make progress. The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years. The economy is in a very different place. Unemployment was 10% at the height of the crisis. It's 3.8% now and moving lower.

So, really, what you—the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape. Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that's what you're seeing. For many years, as I mentioned, many years we had interest rates held low to support economic activity, and it's been clear that as we've gotten closer to our statutory goals we should normalize policy and that's really what we've been consistently doing for some years now.

Q: Heather Long from the Washington Post.

Can you give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages? Are we finally going to see that wage growth pick up this year? I know you're forecasting a little bit more inflation. But is that going to translate through to wage growth?

MR. POWELL: You know, wages have been gradually moving up. Earlier in the recovery, they were—there are many different wage measures, of course, but so just to—just to generalize, wages were running, roughly, around 2% and they've moved gradually up into between 2 to 3% as the labor market has become stronger and stronger.

I think it's fair to say that some of us—and I, certainly, would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemployment that we've had, as I mentioned, from 10% to 3.8%. Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we've talked about at the committee and elsewhere.

But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated and many people have anticipated that wages—that in a world where we're hearing lots and lots about labor shortages—everywhere we go now we hear about labor shortages—but where's the wage reaction? So it's a bit of a puzzle. I wouldn't say it's a mystery.

But it's a bit of a puzzle and, frankly, I do think there's a lot to like about low unemployment, and one of the things is you will see pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody, but people who want to get jobs many of them will be able to get jobs. You will see wages go up. You'll see people at the—sort of the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back into work. They benefit from that. Society benefits from that. So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked.

Our role, though, is also to—you know, to make sure that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we're gradually raising rates.

Q: Don Lee from the L.A. Times.

On both inflation and unemployment, the new projections for unemployment's lower than before and inflation higher. And how much is the Fed willing to accept that's an overshoot for both of those before it affects policy?

MR. POWELL: You mentioned that unemployment moved down, inflation moved up, by truly small amounts. If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semi-tick between now and March. And you ask—you know, I mean, I think we take a longer-run view that we're shooting for—we're aiming for 2% inflation, inflation around 2%. We know that it'll be above or below. We're not—we didn't overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2%. We won't overreact to it being over 2%. And I think we'll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it leaves—if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned.

In terms of unemployment, you know, we have to acknowledge that we are—no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time. And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older. Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates. We don't know this with precision. So we have to be learning as we go. We've got to be looking at data and informed by what's coming in.

And as I mentioned, I think, at the last press conference, estimates by members of the committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we've learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn't really reacted.

So I can't give you a precise number, but I just—you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data. And this uncertainty is why—the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we've been gradually raising rates. We're not waiting for inflation to show up. We're go ahead and moving gradually and trying to navigate between two risks, really. One would be moving too quickly. Inflation never gets back to target if we do that. And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have—we have too much inflation or financial instability and we have to raise quickly. And that can also have bad outcomes.

Q: Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.

Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves. And you mentioned, of course, that the IOER was raised by the committee 20 basis points. That's a result, as you said, of the upward drift of the effective fed-funds rate in that target range.

Do you think that that's going to resolve that issue, or might there be further action required by the committee in the future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range? And further, was there discussion among the committee today about what's causing that? Is it purely technical, perhaps related to bill issuance? Or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves? Thank you.

MR. POWELL: Thanks.

So I would say that, remember, the important thing is that we want the federal-funds rate to trade in the target range. That's the whole idea. IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen. And we've said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools as appropriate. We don't expect to have to do this often or again, but we're not sure about that. If we have to do it again, we'll do it again. Again, don't expect it to happen.

You asked why. And, yes, you know, of course, we're looking carefully at that. And, you know, the truth is we don't know with any precision. Really no one does. You can't run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other. You know, I think there's a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money-market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up the federal-funds rate towards IOER.

We don't know that that's the only effect. And, you know, we're just going to have to be watching and learning. And frankly, we don't have to know today. What we really need is to have the federal-funds rate trade in the range. And that's what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes.

Q: Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.

So with the numbers that we're looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs. The wages are increasing. Are we seeing with the fiscal policy, a fundamental shift in the economy where we have lower natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment, lower inflation?

MR. POWELL: Your question—your first question really is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower? So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time. We don't think that the natural rate of unemployment—you know, it's not one of those variables that moves around a lot. It tends to be driven by slow-moving variables, like the education level of the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that. So you know, it may—it may have moved down too on a cyclical basis lower. As the economy gets hotter and hotter, there's some possibility of that. But you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done. And, you know, real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which are—which are quite wide. So we have to remember that and very much be guided by the incoming data.

You ask about inflation. You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2% inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed really control. And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that, using our tools to do that. I think in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary, has been pushing down on inflation. And so we've been pushing back up. Of course, all those years when we were growing up it was the opposite. Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down. It's really important that inflation not fall below 2%, that inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2%. Very important, because the implications of inflation below 2% are that you're closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we'll spend more time there, and we won't be able to do the job that we're assigned to do for our citizens.

Q: Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television.

You guys moved the median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5% but left the long run at 4.5% today. But you're only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the Fed's fund rate beyond your longer-run value. How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5% up to about 4.5% rate?

MR. POWELL: Yeah, I just would—I would just emphasize that—a couple things. First, we're learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go. So it's moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012. So it's not so simple as thinking, well, boy, we've just got to go ahead and get that right up. If you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you're still seeing inflation very close to target. So there's no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low.

So that's—so it's important to know that the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts. And so each person who's submitting them is submitting, you know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person's assessment. And their assessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2%. So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously we'd be showing higher rates. But that's not what we think will happen.

Q: If I could just follow up really quickly, then why, I guess, would the longer-run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number?

MR. POWELL: Yeah. It may be. It may be. We may find that out. You know, the best estimate that we have over the longer-run is that—although, you know, there's a range of views. Some people are in the low 4s. And as, again, I said, the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but three quarters of a percent, that kind of thing. So it's very possible. We have to be—you know, we can't do—we can't be too attached to these unobservable variables. You know, I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things. And we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy.

Q: Victoria Guida, Politico.

I have a couple of regulatory questions. First of all, on the countercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two? And then my second question is, there's been a lot of talk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses. And I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where marijuana is legal.

MR. POWELL: So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. That's the language that we've used. And that's certain a possibility. I wouldn't say that—I wouldn't look at today's financial stability landscape and say that risks are meaningfully above normal. I would say that they're roughly at normal. You have—you know, households are well—you know, are in good shape. They've paid down their debt. Incomes are rising. People have jobs. So households are not really a concern. And banks are highly capitalized, so that's not really a concern.

We see there's some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets. But overall, if you—if you bake it all in, I think we see, generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate. Could that change, you ask, over a couple of years? Yeah, it could.

You also asked about marijuana businesses. So this is a very difficult area because we have state law. Many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn't, so it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation. I think it would be great if that could be clarified. We don't have, you know—it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position.

And, of course, this isn't our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don't really—we just would love to see it clarified, I think.

Q: John Heltman with American Banker.

So since you—since even before you were chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the Supervisory Committee, you laid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that's actually been pretty consistent. So there was the guidance on boards of governors, there was some changes to the stress tests—not changes to the stress tests, but rather clarification on the modeling, and now more recently the changes to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress tests with the stress capital buffer.

Are these kind of the—are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning? Or are you just—are you kind of done for the time being? Or what else can we expect from the Fed?

MR. POWELL: It's actually a pretty full docket right now. You had mentioned a number of the things, but I would—I would point out we're having, I guess, a public board meeting tomorrow on the single-counterparty credit limit provision. We've also got quite a lot of work to promulgate rules after S. 2155, that Sen. [Mike] Crapo's bill passed. We've got a lot of work to do under that. We've got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risk below that level.

So what am I missing? There is—oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be done. So there's a lot of work to do, I think.

You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago. We went to work for 10 years to strengthen it—stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning. We want to keep all that stuff, we want to make it, you know, even more effective and, certainly, more efficient. We want to tailor those regulations for institutions. We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions.

So we're committed to preserving and enhancing that structure. But we're finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring regulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that's a lot of what we're working on right now.

Q: You said at the beginning of your press conference that you plan to be more plain-spoken. And so, OK, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, that this path of rate hikes that you've laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see. Thank you.

MR. POWELL: You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape. If you look at household surveys, confidence is high. Look at businesses, confidence is high. If you ask—if you survey workers about the job market, they'll say that it's a really good environment to find jobs. If you survey businesses, they'll say that workers are scarce. So I think overall, we have—we have a really solid economy on our hands here.

And so what we're doing is we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor market strong and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2%. That's really what we're trying to do.

And, you know, I would say I like the results so far. We've been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly. I think we've been patient. I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to.

We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I'm really glad we didn't. But at this time, continuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing. If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we'll certainly react to that.

Q: David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires.

Where do you see the neutral interest rate is right now? Do you think it's—do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures? And how will you know when we're getting close to that neutral point? So if—you know, if inflation stays around 2, doesn't go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point?

MR. POWELL: So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the committee, which I think is 2¼ to 3½, and the median is 2.9, right in there. So that's the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest. And we do understand that there's high uncertainty around the level, but that's kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed-funds is going to trade after today's decision.

You ask is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy. Yes. I mean, there should be an effect. If you have increased deficits, that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let's say. Again, though, we're estimating these things. It's one of these unobserved variables. So it's very hard to—we shouldn't try to speak about it with a lot of precision or confidence. But, yes, that should put upward pressure on it.

How will we know? Well, I think you have to look at inflation. You've got to look at—you've got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what's happening in the job market. And inflation's really important. It's worth noting that the last two business cycles didn't end with high inflation. They ended with financial instability. So that's something we need to also keep our eye on.

Q: Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.

Have you talked during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word "accommodative" that described the monetary policy for almost 10 years? And could this change in the vocabulary make the markets nervous? And have you thought already of some options also to know how you're going to call it down the road?

MR. POWELL: Yes, that is something that we discuss. We look at all the language. As you know, we made a significant number of changes at this meeting. So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes. That's what happens. We really—our approach to policy hasn't changed. And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, for a long time the economy has needed accommodative monetary policy. As the economy has recovered, we've been gradually raising rates. And we will be at a place relatively soon when—again, assuming we stay on this path—when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral. And at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the committee thinks that policy is accommodative. We know that's coming. We kind of don't think it's here yet, but it's certainly coming. And I think the market will understand that. I mean, the real message is that you're getting close to the neutral rate. It's a characterization about where policy is. It's not a statement really that should upset the markets. But, you know, we'll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and communicate about it. So—

Q: [inaudible] from the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's newspaper.

Would you expand on the—on your views on the downside risks, especially in regard to our trade issues? Many people are—in the key allies of the United States are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of the international [inaudible] order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment. So—and that will, of course, have very negative economic implications for the global economy, as well as the U.S. economy. So would you have—can I have your views on that?

MR. POWELL: Sure. So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I'm really committed to staying in our lane on things. We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress, and that's maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability. Trade is explicitly assigned to the executive branch by Congress, not to us, so we don't really—we don't really seek to play a role in trade policy. We're not at that level. Those are—those powers and decisions are given to others. And so we want to stick to what we do.

And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes. And I just mentioned what those are. There is concern that trade changes could be disruptive. And as I also mentioned, we don't see it in the numbers yet. We really don't. We see a very strong economy across a bunch of fronts.

It hasn't reached everyone. Let's be clear on that. But most people who want a job can find one. We're well aware that there are pockets out there of people who have not felt the recession [sic] yet. But broadly speaking, it's a good economy.

Q: Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR.

About financial conditions, which worries you more—warnings that rising short-term rates are bringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very slowly and, in fact, are nearly 20 basis points below their recent high? How do you account for the fact that long rates have been so slow to rise? And what does it say about the inflation outlook as well?

MR. POWELL: So let me briefly mention the yield curve. I mean, the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants. And I—you have a range of views. It's something we're going to continue to be talking about. But it's one of only many things, of course, that we talk about.

I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate? How do we understand what the neutral rate is? How do we know where it is? And what are the consequences of being above or below it? That's really what—when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve, that's really what they're talking about.

We know why—we know why the yield curve is flattening. It's because we're raising the federal-funds rate. It makes all the sense in the world that the short end would come up.

I think you asked—the harder question is what's happening with long rates. And there are many things that move long rates around. Of course, there's an embedded expectation of the path of short rates. There's the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards. And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it.

In addition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk on, risk off. In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasurys. And you see, you know, Treasury prices go up, rates go down, quite a lot. So—but I think ultimately, you know, what we really care about is what's the appropriate stance of policy. And there's a—there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate. And I think that's why people are paying attention to the yield curve.

Q: Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.

Companies are buying back their shares at a record rate. Corporate debt is up. Consumer debt is rising. Are we in a credit bubble? Is that something that you're worried about?

MR. POWELL: So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth. You don't see high levels of credit going out; so not so much households. And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis was particularly in—among household borrowing, particularly around mortgages.

With—you take banks, then, of course, their leverage is significantly lower. Or to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher. If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that's really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history. But defaults are low. Interest rates are low. You know, so that's something we're watching very carefully. But again, I don't think we see it as—I think there are a range of views on that. But we are watching nonfinancial corporates.

Households are in good shape, though. And that is so important, because that's where—you know, that's where we got into trouble before. And that's—it's often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge. We don't really see that now. So we take some solace from that.

Q: Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.

Chair Powell, you referenced a minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn't have as much when rates are low and inflation is low. And I'm wondering if you or the committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come. And do you think that that has played any part in either your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions? Or is it, you know, just purely based on what the economy is doing?

MR. POWELL: So it doesn't play any part in my thinking, and I'll tell you why. If you raise rates too quickly, you're just increasing the likelihood of a recession. And that's exactly what you don't want to do. So the best thing you can do, I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction. If you're—if you're worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little lower in raising rates and tolerate—and that's likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound. I think we're far enough now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced. And so I think it's more just—we're just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2%.

Q: Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.

You talked earlier about wage growth and your basic message to workers. How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like that workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well, in wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future? Thank you.

MR. POWELL: You know, we don't—we don't have the tools to control that. If companies choose to—companies in our system are free to do what they can, what they need to do, once they've—once they've made profits and have cash to distribute. They can distribute it to their shareholders, they can buyback—either through dividends or through buybacks. They can pay their workers. You know, the part—and we don't play a role in those decisions. The part that we focus on is maximum employment. That's our mandate. So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it's not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.

And so I think we've been committed to that. I think we take that obligation very seriously. And you know, over time when labor markets are strong, and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages. But again, we don't really have the tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing.

 HDUpdate: FOMC Lifts Fed Funds Rate To 1.75%-2%, Signals 4 Hikes In 2018 -- MarketWatch   WC197 words   PD13 June 2018   ET23:15   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday lifted a key U.S. interest rate to a range of 1.75% to 2% and signaled it will raise the cost of borrowing four times this year. Previously the central bank had forecast three rate hikes in 2018. The vote was 8-0. While the Fed said monetary policy remains "accommodative," the central bank dropped longstanding language about rates remaining "below levels that are expected to prevail in the long run." The change in the policy statement suggests the Fed no longer thinks money is cheap, though senior officials are still uncertain as to just how high they will increase their benchmark rate. The FOMC left its estimate of what it considers a neutral rate at 2.9%. By the end of 2018 the Fed expects its benchmark rate to average 2.4%. It's then expected to rise to 3.1% in 2019 and 3.4% by 2020 before eventually declining.

 HDUS  Federal Reserve  raises key  interest rate , signals more hikes coming   BYHeather SCOTT    WC767 words   PD13 June 2018   ET23:14   SNAgence France Presse   SCAFPR   LAEnglish   CYCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2018 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved. 
   LPThe US Federal Reserve raised the benchmark lending rate on Wednesday for the second time this year, and signaled it will be more aggressive about rate increases in 2018 and 2019 amid "strong" economic growth.

And although he acknowledged concern among businesses nationwide about the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's abrasive trade policies, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that "the US economy is in great shape."
   TDThe unanimous vote the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee brings the federal funds rate to a range of 1.75-2.0 percent, and indicated there would be two more rate increases this year and four next, one more than previously expected.

Wall Street was not happy with the aggressive new stance, worried that it signaled concerns about rising prices. All three major indexes turned negative right after the announcement and closed even lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 percent and the broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.4 percent.

However, Powell downplayed concerns about accelerating inflation, saying the central bank would not overreact to an expected uptick driven by the recent increase in oil prices and would aim for the rate to hold at around two percent for a "sustained" period.

"We know inflation is going to bounce around," he told reporters. "We didn't overreact, I think, to inflation being under two percent. We won't overreact to it being over two percent."

The Fed last raised the benchmark in March, the sixth increase since December 2015 as it tries to keep the economy growing at a sustainable pace without fueling inflation.

The FOMC statement stressed that rising rates were unlikely to derail economic growth -- which the committee now characterizes as "strong" rather than "moderate."

In another slight change of language -- something that always draws the scrutiny of Fed watchers -- it said "further gradual increases" in the key rate "will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the Committee's symmetric two percent objective over the medium term."

The use of the terms "symmetric" and "medium term" is a clear indication the Fed is not in a hurry to get inflation to two percent and will be comfortable if prices rise above that level for a short time -- which Powell confirmed.

Even so, Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, summarized the Fed's outlook as "a bit more hawkish than expected."

In its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, officials projected the Fed's preferred inflation measure would accelerate only slightly, ending this year at 2.1 percent rather than 1.9 percent, and holding at that level through 2020.

That index currently is at two percent but other measures of consumer and producer prices have accelerated, pushed by rising fuel prices, as well as higher metals prices that could be the result of the steep import tariffs Trump imposed starting in March.

Powell said the Fed would continue to watch prices and employment data closely to gauge the impact of inflation and the trade policies on the economic outlook.

The quarterly economic forecasts show central bankers now expect the benchmark rate to end the year at 2.4 percent rather than the 2.1 percent projected in March. And the median forecast for the end of 2019 is 3.1 percent, up from the previous 2.9 percent, which signals four hikes this year and next.

Powell also said the recent tax cuts were expected to provide stimulus to the economy.

However, the FOMC's economic growth forecasts were little changed, with 2018 GDP seen rising 2.8 percent rather than 2.7 percent but unchanged at 2.4 percent in 2019 and two percent in 2020.

The already historically low unemployment is projected to fall even further, ending the year at 3.6 percent before settling at 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020.

Powell also announced that he would hold a press conference after every policy meeting, rather than the current quarterly schedule.

The change will start in January following the meetings that are scheduled roughly once every six weeks, to give the Fed "more opportunities to explain our actions," Powell told reporters.

But he said "having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or the pace of interest rate changes."

Economists had predicted the Fed would make this change to overcome the common view that the central bank only moves rates at meetings that includes press conferences, which limits its options.

 HDFed raises key rate and sees possible acceleration in hikes   BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER    CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,090 words   PD13 June 2018   ET23:14   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve took note of a resilient U.S. economy Wednesday by raising its benchmark interest rate for the second time this year and signaling that it may step up its pace of rate increases.

The Fed now foresees four rate hikes this year, up from the three it had previously forecast. The action means consumers and businesses will face higher loan rates over time.
   TDThe central bank raised its key short-term rate by a modest quarter-point to a still-low range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. With the economy now nine years into an expansion, the move reflects the steadiness of growth, the job market's strength and inflation that's finally reaching the Fed's 2 percent target level.

Economists said the Fed left little doubt that it's prepared to increase the pace of its credit tightening to guard against high inflation later on.

"The labor market is getting tighter, and price pressures are picking up," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. "The Fed is prepared to be quicker about pushing rates higher."

It was the Fed's seventh rate increase since 2015, and it followed an increase in March this year.

The announcement helped resolved a debate in financial markets over whether the Fed under Jerome Powell, who succeeded Janet Yellen as chairman in February, might see a need to signal a possible acceleration in rate hikes. The statement the Fed issued Wednesday after its latest policy meeting ended suggested that he does.

Besides raising its projection for rate increases this year from three to four, the Fed removed a key sentence from the previous statement that had been viewed as foreseeing a need to keep rates low for an extended period. The Fed's new projection for the pace of rate hikes shows four this year, three in 2019 and one in 2020.

At a news conference, Powell sought to portray the Fed's actions as evidence mainly that the economy is doing well and not that the central bank is eager to accelerate its rate increases.

"The economy is in great shape," Powell said.

He acknowledged that the Fed is hearing concerns from some business executives about the Trump administration's combative trade policies, including anecdotal cases in which companies have postponed hiring or major purchases.

But Powell added, "For now, we don't see that in the numbers at all."

Trump has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, has threatened additional tariffs on Chinese imports and has directed his administration to consider further duties on imported cars. Those moves have inflated steel and aluminum costs.

Powell appeared at ease Wednesday in fielding questions ranging from the intricacies of monetary policy to banking regulation and even to whether marijuana should be legalized. (He said that as Fed chairman, he had no position on that.)

And he announced that in the interest of public transparency, he will begin next year to hold a news conference after each of the Fed's eight policy meetings each year, rather than only once a quarter.

"This does not signal anything about the future pace of interest rates hikes," the chairman cautioned.

Since the Fed began holding quarterly news conferences in 2011, it has announced major policy moves only at the quarterly meetings, which have all been followed by a news conference by leader of the Fed.

The central bank's new median forecast projects the Fed's benchmark rate at 3.1 percent by the end of 2019, up from 2.9 percent in the previous forecast. For 2020, the Fed foresees a median of 3.4 percent. That means that by then, it thinks its key rate will finally exceed the 2.9 percent it sees as neutral — as neither stimulating nor restraining growth. Should the Fed's expectations prove accurate, its policy would then be intended to slow the economy.

The Fed now envisions stronger growth this year — 2.8 percent, up from the 2.7 percent it predicted in March. Unemployment, now at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, would drop to 3.6 percent by year's end and to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020 — levels not seen in 49 years. Inflation by the Fed's preferred gauge would hit its 2 percent target this year and edge up to 2.1 percent over the next two years.

A gradual rise in inflation is coinciding with newfound economic strength. Consumer and business spending is powering the economy, in part a result of the tax cut President Donald Trump pushed through Congress late last year. With employers hiring at a solid pace month after month, unemployment has reached 3.8 percent. Not since 1969 has the jobless rate been lower.

Beginning in 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis, the Fed had kept its key rate unchanged at a record low near zero for seven years. It then raised rates once in 2015, once in 2016, three times in 2017 and now twice this year.

The Fed aims to achieve its mandates of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices by lowering rates to spur growth during times of economic weakness and raising rates to slow growth if the economy threatens to overheat. When the Fed tightens credit, it aims to do so without derailing the economy. But if it miscalculates and overdoes the credit tightening, it can trigger a recession.

At nine years, the economic expansion is now the second-longest in history. It will become the longest if it lasts past June 2019, at which point it would surpass the expansion that lasted from March 1991 to March 2001.

The Fed's pace of rate hikes for the rest of the year could end up reflecting a tug of war between a sturdy economy and the risks to growth, including from a potential trade war that could break out between the United States and such key trading partners as China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico. All those countries have vowed to retaliate against any U.S. tariffs with their own penalties against U.S. goods.

By Ann Saphir
   TDJune 13 (Reuters) - Traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures increased bets the Federal Reserve will raise rates again this year and next after the central bank on Wednesday increased its benchmark lending rate and dropped its longstanding pledge to stimulate the economy "for some time."

Traders correctly foresaw the June rate hike, the central bank's second this year, and had been quite confident of a rate hike in September. But on Wednesday they began pricing in a better than even chance of a December rate hike, up from a 37 percent chance seen before the Fed released its rate-hike decision.

That view was in line with fresh Fed forecasts that showed most of its policymakers believe at least four rate hikes would be appropriate this year.

"We've got the rate hike and we've got another two hikes this year being priced in on the dot plan," said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity Fx in San Francisco. "It doesn't necessarily mean the Fed will deliver it, but the market is responding to the news."

Traders also began pricing in a higher chance of a slightly steeper path of rate hikes next year, futures prices showed, though the path indicated by the Fed's forecasts stuck to the three rate hikes anticipated for 2019 based on Fed forecasts provided in March.

 HDInstant View: Fed raises rates again, sees two more hikes in 2018   WC2,304 words   PD13 June 2018   ET20:57   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday, a move that was widely expected but still marked a milestone in the U.S. central bank's shift from policies used to battle the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

In raising its benchmark overnight lending rate a quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 1.75 percent and 2 percent, the Fed dropped its pledge to keep rates low enough to stimulate the economy "for some time" and signaled it would tolerate above-target inflation at least through 2020.
   TDCOMMENTS:

MIKE TERWILLIGER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RESOURCE LIQUID ALTERNATIVES, RESOURCE CREDIT INCOME FUND, NEW YORK

“Today’s announcement firmly establishes four hikes as ‘base-case’ for 2018 and the conversation now tilts to cadence. Given evidence of tightening supply chains in the U.S., particularly in trucking, where management teams have highlighted difficulties in putting ‘bums in the seat,’ there appears to be incremental inflation pressure that likely haven’t been fully realized. If companies push these costs to consumers, and inflation pressure picks up from here, a 50 bps hike in September becomes a possibility. 

“Today’s incrementally hawkish stance suggests the Fed appears unfazed by heightened EM credit volatility in recent months, partially caused by our interest rate policy. At the same time the U.S. is willing to threaten develop world growth with a potential trade war, the U.S. seems willing to undermine EM growth with our monetary policy. Our policies probably aren’t winning us many friends around the global.”

JASON WARE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ALBION FINANCIAL, SALT LAKE CITY

"I think the statement was a bit hawkish relative to market expectations and that's why we're not getting a rally. The June hike was already in the market and the market is keying off what they expect for the next six months and it was a bit more hawkish. The dot plots suggest two is on the cards for the second half of this year, I'm skeptical, I think it will lean towards one. 

“(Re the yield curve) - I'm a little bit more worried now than a year ago but as far as any immediate threat to the economy, I think it is fairly low. It typically takes, once the yield curve gets down to 50 basis points or less, which is where we are now, it typically takes 12-18 months to invert if it is going to invert, so that suggests we have time (between) now and when it could invert. And then when it does invert it takes typically another 12 months before recession. So, my point is, we are still probably a couple of years off where we really have true anxiety around the flattened yield curve.” 

SPENCER LEVY, SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISOR, CBRE, NEW YORK

“From my perspective, It is not the absolute change but the rate of change that matter most and the Fed has been proceeding in a very cautious, measured fashion at the short end of the curve and the long end of the curve has been doing the same. Given the fact we haven’t seen rapid changes, slow and steady is winning the race now.

“From the current real estate perspective, some people are pointing to the potential for yield curve inversion. While it is a risk factor, I’m not as worried about that causing the next recession either because of the rise in the percentage of non-bank financial institutions that are not as yield-curve dependent as banks and also because liquidity has never been deeper globally than it is now.

HEIDI LEARNER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SAVILLS STUDLEY, SAVILLS PLC, NEW YORK

“The real surprise is that the Fed signaled its intention to hike an additional two times this year after today. That’s surprising since GDP growth for the year was only revised up by 0.1 percent to 2.8 percent, and PCE inflation is forecast at 2.1 percent, really in line with the Fed’s 2 percent target. 

“They kept the phrase that policy remains accommodative in the statement but if we do get to 2.4 percent by year-end we’ll only be 50 bps below what the Fed sees as the longer-run rate.

Not a large reaction from bonds at this point, just 4 bps or so higher in yield across the curve

ILYA GOFSHTEYN, MACRO STRATEGIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK, NEW YORK

“The big surprise came from the dot plots for 2019. The fact that they are now thinking about a faster pace of hikes further out is driving the market reaction currently, therefore it’s not a surprise that the dollar is strengthening across the board and of course emerging markets are participating in that move as well.

“Obviously, anything that suggests that rates are going to be in a faster pace of acceleration is a detriment to EM asset performance. I think that the EM story is a little bit exhausted at this point, so you’re seeing a reaction in EM FX but for the most part it hasn’t been violent so far.

“This is a hawkish surprise that makes the outlook for emerging markets that much more difficult.”

MATTHEW FORESTER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LOCKWOOD ADVISORS INC, KING OF PRUSSIA, PENNSYLVANIA

"In my view, this is very much what markets had expected, but there was some question about the December rate hike and it looks like the Fed is sticking to that plan and I would say this is a very mild negative for risk markets at this juncture. But as the Fed continues along the tightening path, each rate hike becomes more difficult for the risk markets and the real economy to digest.

"We're expecting what the markets are expecting, that the Fed could institute a press conference at every FOMC meeting, that means that Fed watching will become back in vogue. Now we will need to watch every single meeting. It also means that monetary policy could become more uncertain, because the markets will need to assess their forecast for each and every meeting."

JUAN PEREZ, CURRENCY TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON

“Just like we predicted, the Fed would see no issues hiking after such a consistent run of economic indicators recently. Business confidence remains good even in the midst of trade concerns. The outlook for four hikes this year have gone up.”

KATIE NIXON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTHERN TRUST WEALTH MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO

“The 'wow' moment for me when I heard the statement was that the Fed is anticipating unemployment going even lower to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020 and they did not uptick their inflation forecast. So it seems clear the Fed is on board with the premise that we can continue to grow and to improve the employment picture, without necessarily paying the price, quote-unquote, in the form of higher inflation.”

“Markets were generally anticipating that this would be the decision in terms of what was going on with rates, so I don’t see this as being a tremendous surprise. You can see the movement in the market is negligible at best…. Where I do see this impacting the market, though, is I think it creates a little bit more uncertainty. They dropped the excessively   accommodative language from the forward guidance, they are clearly on board with the U.S. economy continuing to grow through 2019 and into 2020, so there is no growth slowdown or anything like that in the forecast. So I do think this creates a little bit more uncertainty about whether the Fed will get even more aggressive down the road should they see these conditions firm up further.”

SHAWN CRUZ, MANAGER, TRADER STRATEGY, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO

“There’s definitely a little more hawkish tone. If you look back at what really started the sell-off of February, it was the concern about inflation coming out of the jobs report. It looks like the Fed is confirming the build in inflation…I think the changes in projections were actually good for investors. It’s not too high of an inflation number. We did get an increase in GDP growth, and we also got a drop in expected unemployment. If you’re an investor, those are good projections you want to hear. The market likes increased growth expectations.”

ANDRES GARCIA-AMAYA, CEO, ZOE FINANCIAL, NEW YORK

“Overall this is definitely more hawkish but for good reason, inflation data has accelerated. There was a bit of a scare data-wise and you got enough data points recently to show the economic activity is still very strong. You add those two things – economic activity still strong or really strong and inflation showing signs of life - they are trying to basically just get back to neutral.

"The other thing is they didn’t change what they consider to be neutral. But if you want to play this forward, what would change for the yield curve for instance is if they decide neutral is 2.9 percent. That didn’t change, they kept that at 2.9 percent. I always watch that more carefully than the noise of right now. Because the reality is three or four hikes this year is not as important as how those dots look next year and the year after that. So, four hikes versus three hikes this year - what does that actually mean for the consumer? Not much, it matters to the market in the short term but it doesn’t matter to the consumer that much. Where the consumer really cares is what is normal, what is neutral? Is it 2.9 percent, 3.5 percent, 4 percent - because that is going to anchor mortgages, that is going to anchor all the real bogeys the consumer cares about.”

AMO SAHOTA, DIRECTOR, KLARITY FX, SAN FRANCISCO

"They dropped the reference to rates will remain neutral for some time. That's more hawkish."

"We've got the rate hike and we've got another two hikes this year being priced in on the dot plan. It doesn't necessarily mean the Fed will deliver it, but the market is responding to the news."

"Just dropping the reference that rates will remain below neutral for some time is a little bit more hawkish as well. In terms of initial market reaction, the dollar is stronger, but not an outsized move."

THOMAS MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA

“Everything about that is exactly in line, which is why the market is not doing anything. It could have stayed at three, it could have gone up to four, but four was definitely in the mix so that is really not a surprise. I guess it is a little on the high side. We had two strong inflation numbers during the meeting. Not too hot but still you’ve gotten some nice increases there so definitely to have raised rates was the right thing to do. It is not surprising the dots have gone to two more rates but they didn’t change the out years. What will be the most interesting will be the commentary (at the press conference) about it.”

BILL NORTHEY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT, HELENA, MONTANA

“Notably with their latest economic projections, there are upgrades across the board in growth, inflation and employment. You have short-rates pushing up a bit and equity softening up with the likelihood of a fourth rate hike this year. This is not a total surprise. Rates futures have suggested this as a coin-toss coming in. Overall this is not big change in the Fed’s outlook. ”

STEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEDBUSH SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO

"The fact they're talking about four rate hikes this year instead of three is disappointing. Everybody knew they were  going to hike in June. People thought they might pause in September. It doesn't look like they're going to do that"

"Higher interest rates is not good news for the stock market. It creates a competitive investment and there's a chance it slows economic growth."

"The Fed isn't the biggest player here ... You have to look at it from a more global perspective," he said. "If the ECB or the Bank of Japan begin tightening it'll have a bigger impact than the Fed" (because the Fed has already been raising rates and reducing its balance sheet for some time.)

AARON ANDERSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH, FISHER INVESTMENTS, SAN FRANCISCO

“The Fed’s path of gradual rate hikes and slow sheet reduction seems well established at this point. The trajectory of U.S. inflation or the broader U.S. economy would likely need to change materially for the FOMC to deviate from that path. But U.S. economic data has been remarkably steady. Recent developments in Italy, Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and elsewhere aren’t severe enough to force the Fed’s hand. Chairperson Powell has been clear he doesn’t view Fed policy as the source of turmoil, so those hot spots would need to pose a real risk to the global economy for the Fed to react.”

MARKET REACTION:

STOCKS: The Dow <.DJI> weakened to show a loss of 0.2 percent, but was already down slightly before the statement. The S&P 500 <.SPX> extended a slight loss and was also down 0.2 percent.  BONDS:  The 10-year U.S. Treasury note <US10YT=RR> yield rose to 3.0032 percent and the 2-year yield <US2YT=RR> rose to 2.5984 percent.

   LPThe U.S. dollar pared earlier losses on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points. The move had been widely anticipated by market participants and marks the second rate hike of the year out of at least three expected from the U.S. central bank. Focus now shifts to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who will hold a press conference to discuss the policy update (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-fed-rate-decision-and-powell-press-conference-live-blog-and-video-2018-06-13) at 2.30 p.m. Eastern. Analysts will be looking for clues about future rate hikes and whether the central bank sees scope for four such raises in total in 2018. The ICE U.S. Dollar index , which measures the bucks against six rivals, was retraced its earlier downtrend but failed to get far in positive territory. The gauge was last up 0.1% at 93.865, while the euro , which is the greenback's main rivals, last fetched $1.1747, little changed from Tuesday.

13 Jun 2018 14:00 ET  Fed Raises Rates and Signals Faster Pace in Coming Years

By Nick Timiraos

WASHINGTON-The Federal Reserve said it will raise interest rates by another quarter-percentage point and signaled it could lift them at a slightly faster pace this year to keep a strengthening economy on an even keel.

The latest increase, the second this year, will bring the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 1.75% and 2%. Officials penciled in a total of four rate increases for this year, up from a projection of three increases at their March meeting.

"The committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal-funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2% objective over the medium term," the Fed's rate setting committee said in its postmeeting statement.

Eight of 15 officials now expect at least four rate increases will be needed this year, up from seven in March and four in December. Most officials expect the Fed would need to raise rates at least three more times next year and at least once more in 2020, leaving rates in a range between 3.25% and 3.5% by the end of 2020, the same end point officials projected in March.

The new interest rate guidance shows the U.S. central bank is effectively sticking to a plan to continue raising short-term rates after they reach the level Fed officials expect would neither stimulate nor slow the economy, a so-called neutral level. It also suggests officials expect to reach that neutral level slightly sooner than before.

In a further sign of how the Fed's interest-rate footing has changed over the last year, the postmeeting statement dropped language added four years ago that said officials expected to hold their benchmark rate "for some time" below a neutral setting.

Fed officials have upgraded considerably their economic outlook over the past year, first because of a synchronized upturn in global growth beginning last summer, and later after Congress approved stimulus in the form of tax cuts and increased federal spending.

Officials revised their economic projections a little bit in June after making bigger upward revisions in March and last December.

They now see gross domestic product rising 2.8% this year, up from an earlier projection of 2.7%, and they see the unemployment rate falling to 3.6% this year and 3.5% next year, from earlier projections of 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively.

That would leave the unemployment rate a full percentage point below the level officials expect will prevail over the long run, which is a considerable overshoot.

Officials also project slightly stronger price pressures this year than they did in March. They project inflation rising to 2.1% this year and core inflation rising to 2%, from earlier projections of 2% and 1.9%, respectively.

Officials didn't change their estimates of how they expect the economy to perform over the long run. Their estimate of neutral also didn't change compared to projections released in March, with nine of 14 officials putting neutral at either 2.75% or 3%.

The fed-funds rate will now sit around one percentage point below that neutral level. But because many officials expect they will need to raise rates above neutral to a level that would slow growth, they face difficult debates ahead over how much higher to continue to raise rates, and at what pace.

The challenge for central bankers is to lift borrowing costs enough to prevent the economy from overheating, but not so much that it tips into recession.

"Raising rates too slowly would make it necessary for monetary policy to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in an April speech. "But raising rates too quickly would increase the risk that inflation would remain persistently below our 2% objective."

Mr. Powell signaled last month he sees less need for the Fed to continue providing guidance about the likely path of rates, which it started doing after the financial crisis.

"I think forward guidance was very useful in the crisis...and I think it will have a much smaller role going forward," Mr. Powell said at a central-banking conference in May.

The postmeeting statement released Wednesday reflects some of those changes. It is shorter and more direct.

 SEEconomy   HD Federal Reserve  Poised to Raise Rates Again; Fed officials will release new economic projections, and Chairman Jerome Powell will address the media   BYBy Nick Timiraos    WC1,021 words   PD13 June 2018   ET11:30   SNWSJ Pro Central Banking   SCRSTPROCB   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPThe Federal Reserve is likely to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point after its two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday, the seventh such move since late 2015. Officials also will clarify their views on the economic outlook by releasing new projections for rates, unemployment, inflation and economic growth in the years ahead, and Jerome Powell will hold his second press conference as Fed chairman.

The central bank releases its policy statement and the forecasts—the so-called dot plot—at 2 p.m. EDT, and Mr. Powell will take questions starting at 2:30 p.m. Here's what to watch:
   TDThe Dot Plot

Markets have paid heavy attention in recent years to the median of Fed officials' interest-rate projections, but the median may not matter as much if the new forecasts are as evenly split as they were in March.

Back then, 12 of 15 officials expected three or four rate increases this year, with the dozen officials equally divided. This left the median projection at three because two officials favored fewer than three, while only one favored more than four.

For the median dot to shift, then, it only would require one official to move from three to four increases.

It's possible that continued strong hiring in the U.S., which pushed down the unemployment rate to 3.8% in May, leads at least one official to move up from three to four rate rises, moving the median.

But it's just as likely that with few signs of accelerating inflation and new threats to growth from abroad (see below), officials stay where they were in March.

Watch the dots to see where they land.

Global Risks Resurface

International risks have resurfaced recently. For now, these threats—from trade tensions, European political instability and emerging markets—are uncertain and are outweighed by the strong U.S. economic outlook. But they could give Fed officials who are more cautious about raising rates a reason to push back against colleagues who are more eager to do so for fear of domestic overheating.

So far, these risks don't look as severe as market turmoil in early 2016 that led the Fed to scratch plans for multiple rate increases that year. And the bar to deviate from planned rate rises is higher now because inflation is at the Fed's 2% target. Look for any clues about where that bar now sits.

Getting to Neutral

In speeches and interviews, several Fed officials have signaled that the big debates they face over how high to raise rates are premature because policy is still aimed at stimulating economic growth.

They have said the Fed should focus for now on raising their benchmark federal-funds rate gradually to a neutral setting—neither spurring nor slowing growth—before hashing out some of these thornier debates. Among them: Where is neutral? In March, officials estimated it to be anywhere from 2.25% to 3.5%, with nine of 14 officials projecting either 2.75% or 3%.

A rate increase this week would lift the fed-funds rate to a range between 1.75% and 2%.

Has the recent burst of fiscal stimulus led more officials to raise their projection of the neutral rate? Or have forces such as demographics or a demand for safe assets led them to lower their estimates? Watch the new projections for the long-run federal-funds rate for the answer.

Updating the Statement

Look for Mr. Powell to freshen up the postmeeting policy statement by modifying or dropping language that could soon feel out of date.

For example, the statement has described monetary policy as "accommodative" because rates are still low enough to spur economic activity. With the Fed raising rates and shrinking its holdings of bonds and other assets, it eventually won't be able to describe its policy this way.

The statement also has said the fed-funds rate "is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run." With the expected rate rise this week and at least one more penciled in this year, it soon will be time to drop this line.

Mr. Powell signaled last month he sees less need for the Fed to continue providing statements about the future path of rates, a practice it adopted after the financial crisis. Providing such "forward guidance" will also become harder as the policy path becomes less certain.

Tweaking the Rate Target

A surge in U.S. government borrowing is likely to prompt the Fed to tweak the way it sets short-term rates. Officials at their May meeting discussed how the effective fed-funds rate has drifted toward the top of its range, currently between 1.5% and 1.75%, and what to do about it.

The preferred solution, according to minutes of that meeting, was to change the way they set the rate at the upper bound of the fed-funds range, which is the rate the Fed pays on excess reserves parked at the Fed by private banks, called IOER.

The Fed has raised this rate by the same amount as the fed-funds rate—by 0.25 percentage point—at every meeting since it began raising rates in 2015. But the Fed on Wednesday could decide it will raise IOER by just 0.20 percentage point to keep the effective fed-funds rate closer to the middle of the its target range.

   LPStock markets were steady to higher Wednesday ahead of an expected interest rate hike from the US Federal Reserve, traders said.

As euphoria over a historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un receded, investors re-focused on macroeconomic issues with concerns over global trade causing some discomfort.
   TD"With a rate hike widely expected, investors are focused on the Fed's statement wording, economic projections and press conference for clarification on the future pace of interest rate hikes," said Jo Horton, economist at St. George Bank in Sydney.

Key eurozone equity market Frankfurt was higher at the close, while Paris and London were flat, and Wall Street showed slight gains approaching midday in New York.

"The week's prior events have taken a backseat to today's Federal Reserve rate decision, with meetings of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan looming later in the week," said Charles Schwab analysts in a note.

Speculation about further interest rate increases was fuelled by data Tuesday showing US inflation at a six-year high in May.

The dollar continued to enjoy some support ahead of the Fed decision, with the pound hamstrung by British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit struggles after she made some big compromises to push through key legislation.

But the euro was up against the greenback ahead of the ECB's policy meeting on Thursday, as it seeks to wind down its crisis-era stimulus.

On equity markets, Hong Kong's main index dropped 1.2 percent with shares in Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE collapsing more than 40 percent as it resumed trading after agreeing to pay a massive fine over its handling of a US sanctions violation.

The firm suspended trading in April after Washington said it had banned American companies from selling crucial hardware and software components to it for seven years.

Oil prices rose on the back of a big drop in American oil inventories, as reported by the US Energy Information Administration.

This was a reversal from earlier weakness seen just over a week before OPEC and its partners including Russia meet in Vienna to talk about a production cap deal that has been key to a recovery in the commodity for the past two years.

There are worries OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia will push to lift their output ceilings, though they are said to be facing opposition from other members of the cartel, including Iraq.

The International Energy Agency on Wednesday said that an oil production shortfall in Iran and Venezuela may cause OPEC and Russia to decide to open their taps more.

US President Donald Trump meanwhile on Wednesday accused OPEC of driving up oil prices.

 HDU.S. News: U.S., Europe Rate Gap to Widen   BYBy David Harrison in Washington and Tom Fairless in Frankfurt    WC592 words   PD13 June 2018   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA2   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPCentral banks in the U.S. and Europe are both expected to move this week to unwind stimulus policies adopted since the global financial crisis a decade ago.

But the likely steps mask a recent divergence in the fortunes of the world's top two economic blocs, which looks set to keep the central banks on different interest-rate tracks for many months to come.
   TDThe Federal Reserve is likely to raise short-term interest rates Wednesday and pencil in more increases in coming years, to keep the U.S. economy from overheating.

The European Central Bank could signal on Thursday it won't start raising rates for some time even as it moves to phase out its 2.5 trillion euro ($2.95 trillion) bond-buying program.

ECB officials are pondering the causes of a slowdown in eurozone growth that appears to have continued through the spring, as well as the risks posed by international trade spats, higher oil prices and political turbulence in the bloc's No. 3 economy, Italy.

The gap between the two central banks' key policy rates is expected to widen to about 3 percentage points by the end of next year, from about 2 percentage points today, according to forecasts by Fed officials and investors.

That would be the biggest gap since late 2008, when the Fed cut its short-term interest rates far below those of the ECB as it reacted to the subprime crisis.

"With some uptick in political uncertainty, and inflation still below target in the euro area and Japan, monetary policies among the advanced economies look likely to be divergent for some time," said Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard last month.

That reflects different economic fortunes: The eurozone economy currently appears to be growing at half the speed of the U.S. after outpacing its trans-Atlantic counterpart over the past two years.

The American economy, fanned by the recent tax cuts, could grow by more than a 4% annual rate in the second quarter, according to Atlanta Fed projections, the fastest since 2014. Unemployment hit 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years, and inflation has reached the Fed's 2% target after undershooting it for much of the past six years.

In the 19-nation eurozone, where second-quarter growth is expected to be about 2%, the ECB has signaled it could announce as soon as this week plans to phase out its bond-purchase program, known as quantitative easing, which is credited with supporting the region's economic recovery.

But analysts say that move is probably necessary because the ECB is approaching the limits of what it can buy under rules aimed at limiting the impact on markets, and ensuring the program doesn't finance eurozone governments.

Some investors had until recently expected the ECB to start raising rates this year, but most now don't see a first increase until late next year.

A political crisis in Italy last month sent bond markets swinging wildly and raised fears that the new government could push the country out of the eurozone. Rising oil prices and the threat of trade wars have also raised concern in Europe and around the world.

The U.S., by contrast has been better insulated, partly because its economy is less reliant on trade and because it is one of the world's top oil producers.

 HDFed Decision to Set Tone for Summer: ING -- Market Talk   WC1,378 words   PD13 June 2018   ET10:08   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP0807 GMT - Whatever the Federal Reserve chooses to say when it announces its interest rate decision later on "may set the tone for markets this summer," says ING, recommending that "we should prepare for higher short-term U.S. interest-rate volatility." That would be dollar-positive in the current market environment, says the Dutch bank. EUR/USD is flat at 1.1746, ahead of the announcement due at 1800 GMT, when the Fed is largely expected to raise the funds rate to 2% from 1.75%. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)
   TD0807 GMT - Sterling is "always more likely" to react to good news rather than bad, says Societe Generale, which means the pound isn't likely to fall by much if inflation misses forecasts on Wednesday or if other data comes in lower than expected in the near term. However, the bank recommends shorting sterling against the Norwegian krone, which "may pay off near-term." The U.K. runs a trade deficit, while Norway has a trade surplus. With global trade-war uncertainties in the background, countries that import more than they export are under the radar. GBP/NOK trades 0.3% lower at 10.73. GBP/USD falls 0.2% to 1.3352 and EUR/GBP rises 0.2% to 0.8801.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0749 GMT - Seven European countries line up for bond auctions Wednesday, with Italy, Germany and Portugal inside the eurozone and Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and the Czech Republic outside the euro area. Italy's auction covers the three-, seven- and 30-year maturity spectrums, while Sweden, Norway, Germany, Portugal and the Czech Republic won't go beyond the 2029 maturity date. Switzerland is set to launch a new bond due in June 2032. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0733 GMT - Sterling trades 0.1% lower Wednesday, with GBP/USD at 1.3361 and EUR/GBP at 0.8795, a day after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May avoided a defeat in the House of Commons on the Brexit withrawal bill. "Pound's focus today will be on U.K. consumer price index," says ING, adding that any miss may fuel the story that sterling weakness effects are unwinding quicker-than-anticipated, dampening sentiment over an August Bank of England rate increase. "This would keep sterling on the defensive--with soft data and a muddled Brexit political environment--adding little attacking threat," ING says. Inflation has likely risen slightly to 2.45% year-on-year in May, according to a WSJ poll. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0719 GMT - Italy's upcoming bond auction will get broader attention than usual, serving "as a seismograph [of] how investors assess the impact from the new government," say Commerzbank rates strategists. They look forward to a smooth takedown of supply given that issuance is distributed between a three- and 30-year maturity range and relatively small offer volumes. "We do not expect any hiccups given modest auction sizes and further fading stress symptoms," the strategists say. The Italian treasury will offer EUR1.5 billion to EUR2 billion in the April 2021 BTP, EUR1.75 billion to EUR2.25 billion in the May 2025 BTP, and a combined EUR1 billion to EUR1.5 billion in September 2046 and March 2048 BTPs. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0714 GMT - EUR/USD is trading flat on Wednesday at 1.1740, just ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement. "Fed actions will be less important than the sense that the journey toward tighter policy just goes on," says Societe Generale. The central bank is largely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, which would be the second time they increase rates this year. It is also expected to make an adjustment to its forward guidance, which SocGen says "would be the equivalent of a snowflake falling onto a ski slope already covered in snow." (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

0658 GMT - If demand for Italian government bonds at Wednesday's auction is "simply OK," another relief rally can be expected thereafter, say Mizuho rates strategists. The Italian treasury is auctioning up to a total of EUR5.75 billion in bonds due in 2021, 2025, 2046 and 2048. "Decent demand at the long end, which is the sector which offers most risk/reward given the likelihood of the curve remaining volatile and susceptible to higher default risks, should help to reflatten the BTP curve today," say Mizuho's rates strategists. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0655 GMT - Eurozone core and periphery bond yields trade lower early Wednesday ahead of supply from Italy, Germany and Portugal. The 10-year Bund yield is trading about 1 basis point lower at 0.48%, while peripheral bond yields fall more than that, indicating a pick-up in risk-on sentiment. The 10-year Italian BTP yield is down by 7 basis points at 2.81%. Yields move inversely to prices. Bond markets are looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision later Wednesday, with a 25 basis point rise in Fed funds rate expected. Eurozone bond markets also await the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday, with potentially some hints at the exit strategy from asset purchases and at the timing and path of interest rate increases. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0648 GMT - While many economists are expecting another rate hike in India as inflation has ticked up, Merrill Lynch sees the central bank being on a long hold following this month's 1st policy tightening in 4 1/2 years. It contends weak year-earlier inflation is making current levels look big by comparison. The investment bank predicts price growth will slow to 4.2%, lower than the RBI's estimate of 4.7%. Merrill also doesn't see much impact from any hike in state-guaranteed crop-purchase prices as they're expected to remain below market prices. In addition, the bank isn't very bullish on inflation as capacity utilization is still running below 75%. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)

0634 GMT - After the upset in Malaysia, election risks are now seen rising across Asia, says BMI Research, putting fiscal reforms at risk. "The rise in uncertainty in the run-up to the polls amid an increase in election-related rhetoric could present downside risks to investor confidence." If not postponed further, Thailand could hold elections in 1H while Indian and Indonesian are set to next year. BMI sees both countries undertaking populist measures that can potentially reverse the progress made in terms of fiscal reforms the past few years. (saurabh.chaturvedi@wsj.com; @journosaurabh)

0614 GMT - Japanese stocks outperformed today, with the Nikkei right now the region's best performer as it closed up 0.4% at 22966.38 to log its 8th gain in the past 10 trading days. Toyota rose 1.3% amid plans to invest $1 billion ride-hailing firm Grab and SoftBank climbed 2.8% as AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner was cleared in the US, raising hopes about majority-owned Sprint's deal with T-Mobile. Giving Japanese stocks a lift broadly was yen weakness; the dollar was at session highs of Y110.63 just after Tokyo stocks closed versus Y110.43 at the open. Meanwhile, super-long JGB yields rose a half-basis point. (suryatapa.bhattacharya@wsj.com)

0537 GMT - A likely consequence of the rapid build-up of household debt in Australia over the past decade is more years of slow growth and persistent low interest rates. But the risk of a recession, has risen, says Capital Economics. It may be noted that Australia has not had a recession in the last 27 years. There's a danger that the government inquiry into misbehavior by banks results in a slump in credit growth that causes house prices to fall sharply and the economy to weaken, it adds. In the next five years, there may be a 20% chance of the recession. (james.glynn@wsj.com ; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

Bond markets are looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision later Wednesday, with a 25 basis point rise in Fed funds rate expected. Eurozone bond markets also await the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday, with potentially some hints at the exit strategy from asset purchases and at the timing and path of interest rate increases.

   TD0648 GMT - While many economists are expecting another rate hike in India as inflation has ticked up, Merrill Lynch sees the central bank being on a long hold following this month's 1st policy tightening in 4 1/2 years. It contends weak year-earlier inflation is making current levels look big by comparison. The investment bank predicts price growth will slow to 4.2%, lower than the RBI's estimate of 4.7%. Merrill also doesn't see much impact from any hike in state-guaranteed crop-purchase prices as they're expected to remain below market prices. In addition, the bank isn't very bullish on inflation as capacity utilization is still running below 75%. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)

0634 GMT - After the upset in Malaysia, election risks are now seen rising across Asia, says BMI Research, putting fiscal reforms at risk. "The rise in uncertainty in the run-up to the polls amid an increase in election-related rhetoric could present downside risks to investor confidence." If not postponed further, Thailand could hold elections in 1H while Indian and Indonesian are set to next year. BMI sees both countries undertaking populist measures that can potentially reverse the progress made in terms of fiscal reforms the past few years. (saurabh.chaturvedi@wsj.com; @journosaurabh)

0614 GMT - Japanese stocks outperformed today, with the Nikkei right now the region's best performer as it closed up 0.4% at 22966.38 to log its 8th gain in the past 10 trading days. Toyota rose 1.3% amid plans to invest $1 billion ride-hailing firm Grab and SoftBank climbed 2.8% as AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner was cleared in the US, raising hopes about majority-owned Sprint's deal with T-Mobile. Giving Japanese stocks a lift broadly was yen weakness; the dollar was at session highs of Y110.63 just after Tokyo stocks closed versus Y110.43 at the open. Meanwhile, super-long JGB yields rose a half-basis point. (suryatapa.bhattacharya@wsj.com)

0537 GMT - A likely consequence of the rapid build-up of household debt in Australia over the past decade is more years of slow growth and persistent low interest rates. But the risk of a recession, has risen, says Capital Economics. It may be noted that Australia has not had a recession in the last 27 years. There's a danger that the government inquiry into misbehavior by banks results in a slump in credit growth that causes house prices to fall sharply and the economy to weaken, it adds. In the next five years, there may be a 20% chance of the recession. (james.glynn@wsj.com ; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0533 GMT - India's rising inflation and improving growth data will likely lead to another rate hike in August, more are predicting. CPI hit a 4-month high of 4.9% for May, and Deutsche Bank sees it reaching 5.1-5.3% this month, what the firm expects will be the peak this cycle. The central bank last week undertook its first increase in 4 1/2 years. With the output gap continuing to shrink, Deustche says the RBI will be less worried about growth dynamics relative to inflation risks. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)

0504 GMT - "China must be wary" of the potential for full normalization and economic opportunities for North Korea, says Daiwa, as Kim delivering on his pledges and others responding in kind could marginalize China's role on the Korean Peninsula. More importantly, North Korea is a card China would no longer be able to play, the investment bank adds, allowing Trump to potentially go "full throttle" on China. "Let's see what happens" Friday, "when the US is due to reveal a final list of imports from China slated for tariffs." (chester.yung@wsj.com; @chester_yung)

0444 GMT - In looking at Malaysia's new leadership, Moody's is keeping its estimate that direct government debt was 51% of GDP last year despite the new regime saying the figure is at 65%, versus former PM Najib's repeated claims of less than 55%. Including off-balance-sheet items, new leadership puts the total at 80%. "The new administration's treatment of large infrastructure projects that may be placed under review but have benefited from government-guaranteed loans in the past, and outstanding debt from" 1MDB "will play an important role in determining risks that contingent liabilities pose to the credit profile" of Malaysia, the ratings firm says.

0421 GMT - Queensland state forecasting of 5% coal-export growth each of the next 2 years looks challenging to Credit Suisse, putting budget forecasts at risk. Key is the dispute between Aurizon and the state over what firm can charge customers for using its rail network, which hauls virtually all the coal produced in Queensland. "The solution is to fix the broken regulatory structure that has delivered poor outcomes for coal miners, Aurizon" and the state, says Credit Suisse. Coal exports make up about 6% of the Queensland government's revenue. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)

0348 GMT - As the Trump-Kim summit had "no surprises, no disappointment," DBS says a long negotiation process lies ahead and plenty of uncertainties remain. It notes rating agencies may not be in a hurry to upgrade South Korea, and that a surge in capital inflows into the won-denominated assets is unlikely near-term. (chester.yung@wsj.com; @chester_yung)

0346 GMT - The potential credit line from Japan to Malaysia would likely be used for economic development and support smaller companies while giving the government room to continue "cleaning up the red files," or off-balance-sheet items allegedly hidden by the former government. In response, the new leadership has postponed or scrapped a number of big infrastructure projects. AmBank expects a loan from Japan to carry an interest rate of around 1% or less, depending on the project type, over 30-40 years. (yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com; @yantoultra)

0328 GMT - RBA Gov Philip Lowe was clearly impressed with Australia's strong 1Q GDP growth, saying the economy looks to be on an improving trajectory. But he's not rushing to raise interest rates any time soon. For the RBA, it is all about a need for higher wages growth and inflation before it comes off the sidelines with an interest rate increase. "The national accounts provided confirmation that the Australian economy is moving in the right direction," Lowe says. (james.glynn@wsj.com ;@JamesGlynnWSJ)

 HDAnticipation surrounds Fed's rate forecasts after next hike   BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER    CRAP Economics Writer   WC765 words   PD13 June 2018   ET06:05   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to modestly raise its key short-term interest rate for the second time this year. But attention will be focused mainly on any hints that the Fed might accelerate its rate hikes in the coming months.

Some economists think the Fed will signal that it expects to raise rates four times this year, up from its current projection of three hikes. Others believe the central bank will stick with its projection of three rate increases, partly out of concern that rising trade tensions triggered by President Donald Trump's aggressive policies might slow global growth.
   TDThe policymakers will reveal their action in a policy statement and in updated economic forecasts, followed by a news conference by Chairman Jerome Powell. Some analysts are speculating that Powell may announce that he will begin holding a news conference after each of the eight policy meetings the Fed holds each year, rather than only once a quarter.

The Fed's meeting this week will be followed by policy meetings of two other major central banks — the European Central Bank on Thursday and the Bank of Japan on Friday. While Japan's central bank isn't expected to make any major policy shifts, anticipation is rising that the ECB may outline as early as this week plans to begin paring its bond-buying stimulus program as a prelude to ending them altogether.

When the Fed last met in May, it left its short-term rate unchanged. But it noted that inflation was edging near its 2 percent target after years of remaining undesirably low. Should inflation eventually pick up, the Fed might move to tighten credit more aggressively.

A gradual rise in inflation is coinciding with newfound economic strength. After years in which the economy expanded at roughly a tepid 2 percent annually, growth could top 3 percent this year. Consumer and business spending is powering the economy, in part a result of the tax cut President Donald Trump pushed through Congress late last year.

With employers hiring at a solid pace month after month, unemployment has reached 3.8 percent. Not since 1969 has the jobless rate been lower.

Beginning in 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis, the Fed kept its key rate unchanged at a record low near zero for seven years. It then raised rates once in 2015, once in 2016, three times in 2017 and once so far this year, in March. Wednesday's expected quarter-point rate increase will raise the Fed's benchmark rate to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he thinks stronger growth and rising inflation will lead the Fed to raise rates four times this year and four more in 2019.

The Fed aims to achieve its mandates of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices by lowering rates to spur growth during times of economic weakness and raising rates to slow growth if the economy threatens to overheat. When the Fed tightens credit, it aims to do so without derailing the economy. But if it miscalculates and overdoes the credit tightening, it can trigger a recession.

The economic expansion has survived for nine years and is now the second-longest in history. It will become the longest if it lasts past June 2019, at which point it would surpass the expansion that lasted from March 1991 to March 2001.

While many economists think the current expansion will exceed the 1990's streak, some worry about what might occur once the impact of the tax cuts begin to fade and the Fed's gradual rate hikes begin to curb growth.

Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, suggested that the economy could experience a "growth recession," in which the gross domestic product slows so much that unemployment starts to rise.

The Fed's pace of rate hikes for the rest of the year could end up reflecting a tug of war between a sturdy economy and the risks to growth, including from a potential trade war that could break out between the United States and such key trading partners as China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico. All those countries have vowed to retaliate against any U.S. tariffs with their own penalties against U.S. goods.

A global trade war would risk cutting into U.S. economic growth by depressing American export sales and raising inflation by making consumers and businesses pay more for imports.
