   LPTen years after the Great Recession's onset, another long, deep downturn may soon roil the U.S. economy. The high level of asset prices today mirrors the earlier trend in house prices that preceded the 2008 crash; both mispricings reflect long periods of very low real interest rates caused by Federal Reserve policy. Now that interest rates are rising, equity prices will fall, dragging down household wealth, consumer spending and economic activity.

During the five-year period before the last downturn, the Fed had decreased the federal-funds rate to as low as 1%. That drove down mortgage interest rates, causing home prices to rise faster than 10% a year. When the Fed raised rates after 2004, the housing-price bubble burst within two years.
   TDAs housing prices plummeted, homeowners with highly leveraged mortgages found themselves owing substantially more than their homes were worth. They defaulted in droves, causing lenders to foreclose on their properties. Sales of the foreclosed properties forced prices even lower, leading the national house-price index to decline 30% in three years.

Banks that held mortgages and mortgage-backed bonds saw their net worths decline sharply. A total of 140 U.S. banks failed in 2009, and those that survived were terrified by how much further the market might slide. To avoid risky bets, they shied away from lending to businesses and home buyers and refused to lend to other banks whose balance sheets were also declining.

The fall in home prices from 2006-09 cut household wealth by $6 trillion. Coinciding with a stock-market crash, the erased wealth caused consumer spending to drop sharply, pushing the economy into recession. The collapse of bank lending deepened the decline and slowed the recovery to a sluggish pace.

Fast forward to today. Homes aren't as overvalued as they were in 2006, so there's little chance of an exact replay of the 2008 crisis. The principal risk now is that a stock-market slowdown could shrink consumer spending enough to push the economy into recession. Share prices are high today because long-term interest rates are extremely low. Today the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes is less than 3%, meaning the inflation-adjusted yield on those bonds is close to zero. The hunt for higher yields drives investors toward equities -- driving up share prices in the process.

But long-term rates are beginning to rise and are likely to increase substantially in the near future. Though the 3% yield on 10-year Treasurys is still low, it's still twice as high as it was two years ago. It will be pushed higher as the Fed raises the short-term rate from today's 2% to its projected 3.4% in 2020. Rising inflation will further increase the long-term interest rate as investors demand compensation for their loss of purchasing power. And as annual federal spending deficits explode over the coming decade, it will take ever-higher long-term interest rates to get bond buyers to absorb the debt. It wouldn't be surprising to see the yield on 10-year Treasurys exceed 5%, with the resulting real yield rising from zero today to more than 2%.

As short- and long-term interest rates normalize, equity prices are also likely to return to historic price-to-earnings ratios. If the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 regresses to its historical average, 40% below today's level, $10 trillion of household wealth would be wiped out. The past relationship between household wealth and consumer spending suggests such a decline would reduce annual spending by about $400 billion, shrinking gross domestic product by 2%. Add in the effects on business investment, and this spending crunch would push the economy into recession.

Most recessions are short and shallow, with an average of less than a year between the start of the downturn and the beginning of the recovery. That's because the Fed usually responds to recessions by cutting the federal-funds rate substantially. But if one hits in the next few years, the Fed will not have enough room to cut rates, as the fed-funds rate is expected to rise to only 3% by 2020. There also won't be much room for a major fiscal intervention. Federal deficits are expected to exceed $1 trillion annually in the coming years, and publicly held federal debt is predicted to rise from 75% of GDP to nearly 100% by the decade's end.

This means a downturn brought on in the next few years by rising long-term interest rates would likely be deeper and longer than your average recession. Unfortunately, there's nothing at this point that the Federal Reserve or any other government actor can do to prevent that from happening.

* Palladium hit fresh eight-month high (Updates prices, adds quote)
   TDBy Vijaykumar Vedala

BENGALURU, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Gold prices inched up on Friday but held near six-week lows hit in the previous session, as the dollar firmed after upbeat U.S. economic data supported the Federal Reserve's resolve for steady interest rate hikes over the next year.

The dollar stood tall against its peers on Friday after data showed U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter at its fastest pace in nearly four years. Another report showed durable goods rose 4.5 percent in August, rebounding from a revised 1.2 percent drop the month before.

Spot gold was up 0.2 percent to $1,184.91 as of 0405 GMT. On Thursday, the metal fell about 1 percent and touched its lowest since Aug. 17 at $1,181.61 an ounce. Spot gold is down about 1.2 percent for the week, on track for its fourth weekly decline in five.

U.S. gold futures were up 0.1 percent at $1,188.80 an ounce.

The short-term outlook is bearish for gold as the dollar may see some upside due to an ongoing trade war between China and the U.S. and the Federal Reserveinterest rate hike outlook, according to Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau.

The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and said it planned four more increases by the end of 2019 and another in 2020.

"Gold has been trying to overcome the psychological level of $1,200 an ounce for the past few days. We didn't see that happening. And when it doesn't go up, it comes down," said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

"After the prices came down we have seen some physical buying mainly from the businesses, which is offering some support at this time."

Gold is down more than 13 percent from an April high, largely because of the stronger dollar, which has been boosted by a vibrant U.S. economy and fears of a global trade war. Investors have bought the greenback instead of gold as a safe investment.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's accusation of Chinese meddling in the upcoming U.S. elections marks a new phase in an escalating pressure campaign against Beijing that Washington is pursuing on multiple fronts, senior U.S. officials said on Thursday.

"The trade war continues to favour the U.S. dollar and this will generally dampen gold's upside," said Nicholas Frappell, global general manager, ABC Bullion, Australia.

"Large speculative shorts may help cushion weakness as punters keep an eye on levels to close out and take money off the table," he said.

Among other metals, palladium touched a fresh eight-month high at $1,087.40 an ounce. Silver rose 0.6 percent to $14.29 an ounce and platinum declined 0.4 percent to $806.0. (Reporting by Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair)

 HDUPDATE 1-Fed's 'neutral rate' guru downplays theory as rates rise   WC432 words   PD28 September 2018   ET23:22   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LP(Adds forecasts, comments on economy and balance sheet)

By Jonathan Spicer
   TDNEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's point-person on the theory of how high to raise interest rates said on Friday that estimating this "neutral" level is getting more difficult and less relevant as the U.S. central bank continues tightening policy.

"I continue to expect that further gradual increases in interest rates will best foster" growth and the economy's "very strong" outlook through at least next year, New York Fed President John Williams told a forum of economists and students.

As the Fed, which raised its policy rate above 2 percent this week, continues to hike, "it makes sense to shift away from a focus on normalizing the stance of monetary policy relative to some benchmark 'neutral' interest rate, often referred to as 'r-star,'" he said.

The idea of an estimated neutral rate - which in a healthy economy neither boosts nor restrains investment and spending, and can move around over time - has at times dominated debate over how aggressively the Fed needed to tighten policy through the economic recovery from recession.

Williams was one of the authors of this theory. Yet on Friday he said that it has at times received "too much attention" - sentiment that echoes recent comments downplaying such monetary models by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

"At some point in the future it will no longer be clear whether interest rates need to go up or down, and explicit forward guidance about the future path of policy will no longer be appropriate," said Williams, who is among the most influential U.S. central bankers.

As rates approach estimates of "neutral," he added, "what appeared to be a bright point of light is really a fuzzy blur, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in measuring r-star."

The Fed's preferred inflation gauge is near a 2 percent goal and U.S. unemployment is low at 3.9 percent. This dual-goal mandate is "about as good as it gets," Williams said, predicting prices should only edge a bit above target while unemployment falls a bit below 3.5 percent next year.

The Fed is meanwhile restricting credit as it trims its roughly $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds. Williams said the Fed has yet to decide how much to shrink the portfolio, which ran up from $900 billion before the 2007-09 financial crisis.

 HDU.S. consumer spending rises, monthly inflation moderates   WC813 words   PD28 September 2018   ET21:34   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased steadily in August, supporting expectations of solid economic growth in the third quarter, while a measure of underlying inflation remained at the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for a fourth straight month.

Economists said Friday's report from the Commerce Department should allay fears of the economy overheating and likely keeps the U.S. central bank on a gradual path of interest rate increases. The Fed raised rates on Wednesday for the third time this year and removed the reference to monetary policy remaining "accommodative."
   TD"Growth is solid and inflation pressures modest," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. "This is exactly the environment the Fed needs to move interest rates up at a gradual pace as further rate hikes start to look like tightening."

The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.3 percent last month after an unrevised 0.4 percent gain in July. Spending last month was driven by outlays on healthcare, which offset a drop in motor vehicle purchases.

August's increase in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent after climbing 0.3 percent in July.

The report came on the heels of data on Thursday showing a decline in orders for key capital goods in August and a further widening of the goods trade deficit, which prompted economists to downgrade their gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter to as low as a 2.8 percent annualized rate.

Third-quarter GDP growth forecasts were previously as high as a 4.4 percent pace.

The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter, powered by robust consumer spending. Economists said data in hand suggested that consumer spending was on track to grow at about a 3.6 percent rate in the third quarter, close to the 3.8 percent pace set in the April-June period.

Consumer spending is being driven by a tightening labor market, which is starting to boost wage growth, as well as higher savings. It is also being supported by robust consumer confidence.

A separate report on Friday showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index at a six-month high in September. A survey earlier this week from the Conference Board showed consumer confidence hitting an 18-year high in September. The Conference Board places more weight on the labor market.

The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed in late afternoon trade.

EYES ON TARIFFS

In August, spending on goods increased 0.3 percent, likely lifted by higher gasoline prices. Spending on goods rose 0.5 percent in July. Outlays on services advanced 0.4 percent, with spending on healthcare accounting for much of the increase.

There was a moderation in monthly price gains in August. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components was unchanged. That was the weakest reading since March 2017 and followed a 0.2 percent gain in July.

August's flat reading left the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 2.0 percent. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.

Economists say inflation could slightly overshoot its target amid concerns an escalating trade war between the United States and China could lead to price increase for a range of consumer goods.

Washington on Monday slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods.

Walmart Inc <WMT.N>, the largest U.S. retailer, said last week it might hike prices because of the duties on Chinese imports.

"With this $200 billion increase, you are effectively tripling the amount of goods subject to a tariff and that has potential to influence prices," said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

JPMorgan estimates that the tariffs could add 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point to core inflation.

In August, personal income rose 0.3 percent after increasing by the same margin in July. Wages jumped 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in seven months, after rising 0.3 percent in July. The saving rate was unchanged at 6.6 percent last month.

 HDStreetwise: Fed Doesn't Want to Hold Your Hand   BYBy James Mackintosh    WC755 words   PD28 September 2018   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGB1   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWhat's in a word? When it comes to the Federal Reserve, a lot.

The removal of "accommodative" from the Fed's statement on Wednesday was interpreted as a sign that the central bank is approaching the end of its cycle of interest-rate increases, and bond yields declined slightly.
   TDBut the real story is about rising uncertainty as forward guidance is replaced with an implicit shrug of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's well-tailored shoulders.

Mr. Powell seemed to be going out of his way to confuse investors in his press conference. Having dropped "accommodative" as a description of current monetary policy -- something anticipated by many -- he went on to say of the change: "It wasn't because policy's not accommodative. It is still accommodative."

Instead, Mr. Powell explained that the word had outlived its usefulness as a signal to the markets of what the Fed was trying to achieve.

The focus on a single word highlights two important market truths:

The central bank isn't focused on supporting the economy, which is doing very well by itself; and the Fed no longer feels such a need to talk down future policy rates in order to get investors to help.

The result is that things are likely to get a lot more confusing for markets.

The first truth is well understood, not least because interest rates are higher than the Fed's preferred measure of core inflation for the first time since Lehman Brothers collapsed a decade ago.

Policy is clearly no longer such a strong support to the economy as it was when interest rates started to increase.

The second is less obvious at first glance.

The Fed still publishes its dot plot, setting out where policy makers expect the economy, inflation and interest rates to go.

It still explains where it thinks a sustainable unemployment rate is (a median assessment of 4.5%, higher than today) and where interest rates are headed (the median is up to 3.4% by 2020, staying there for a year, before dropping back to a long-term level of 3%).

And Fed policy makers frequently make speeches designed to help investors understand how the central bank will react to economic developments.

Yet, Mr. Powell has been going out of his way to highlight how little the Fed really knows.

On Wednesday, he emphasized the uncertainty in the dot-plot predictions two or three years ahead. He explained that the Fed doesn't have a precise understanding of what policy would be accommodative.

He said that while he hopes that supply-side improvements will follow from the administration's tax cuts, it was also very uncertain.

And he broached the idea that the central bank's estimate of the so-called neutral rate, where monetary policy neither supports nor detracts from economic growth, might be raised.

In short: The Fed doesn't know what will happen, or how it will react.

We should be careful not to go too far. The Fed never really knew what the economy would do, and it might well have breached its previous forward guidance had the economy turned out differently.

After all, the Bank of Canada broke its forward guidance when its economy recovered more quickly than expected, and the Bank of England had to abandon its first attempt at guidance after six months.

Yet, investors have grown used to hand-holding from central banks.

Mr. Powell's step back should increase the uncertainty, meaning that a wider range of outcomes filters into prices.

All else equal, that ought to mean lower stock prices and bond yields.

In some ways, this fits what is going on in markets anyway, as both better and much-worse outcomes become obvious possibilities. Trade battles, Brexit, Italy and emerging-market crises are highly visible threats. Indeed, rumors about the Italian budget pushed up the dollar more against the euro on Thursday morning than the Fed did on Wednesday.

Equally, the tax-cut-driven U.S. economic growth has been far stronger than expected, and inflation has stayed low, raising the chance that the U.S. helps pull up growth in the rest of the world.

A wider range of outcomes should push investors to take less risk, holding fewer or more defensive stocks and more safe bonds, even if the central forecast remains unchanged.

That is the true meaning of no longer being "accommodative."

   LPFed Rate-Range Settings Could See More Tweaks

It looks like the Federal Reserve may not be done making technical tweaks to keep control of its interest-rate target range.
   TDThe central bank's federal-funds target range now stands at 2% to 2.25%, after officials voted to raise it Wednesday. The range is widely expected to be raised again in December.

The top end of that range is determined by what the Fed pays deposit-taking banks to park reserves on the central bank's books. The low end is defined by the rate offered to money funds and other eligible financial firms to do likewise. The fed-funds rate floats in between.

The mechanics of setting that range have become trickier, however. Since June, the Fed has actually set the high-end interest on excess reserves, or IOER, rate lower than the top end of the fed-funds target rate range. After the Wednesday rate rise, it now stands at 2.2%.

The Fed tweaked this rate in part to deal with a fed-funds rate that has been more persistently toward the top end of the range. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at his press conference following this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting that this technical move "worked and it was successful" at keeping the fed-funds rate in line, Mr. Powell said.

While Mr. Powell didn't go into a lot of detail behind the Fed's thinking, he observed that market conditions have been putting upward pressure on the fed-funds rate. "We think it's principally a function of just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well."

Given that Treasury supply remains high in light of an increase in budget deficits tied to Republican-backed tax cuts, the pressure on the fed-funds rate could prove persistent. The Fed may need to lower the interest rate on excess reserves even lower to maintain its range.

An uptick of Treasury bill issuance and a continued drawdown of the Fed's balance sheet make for "a compelling base case" to push the interest rate on excess reserves even lower relative to the top of the range at the December FOMC meeting, for a year-end IOER rate of 2.40%, says Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.

Fed Chairman Addresses Concerns About Flattening Yield Curve

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday played down concerns that bond markets were signaling rising odds of a recession. Mr. Powell addressed concerns over the narrowing spread between short- and longer-term Treasury yields, a difference known as the yield curve. When short-term yields rise higher than longer-term yields, the curve inverts. Over the past 50 years, a recession has almost always followed within a year or two.

How the Fed Can Help Working Women

Martin Uribe in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper studies whether permanent monetary tightenings boost inflation in the short run. He finds that "a gradual and permanent increase in the nominal interest rate causes a fast adjustment of inflation to a permanently higher level, low real interest rates, and no output loss. These findings are consistent with the prediction, sometimes referred to as neo-Fisherian, that a credible announcement of a gradual return of the nominal interest rate to normal levels can achieve a swift reflation of the economy with sustained levels of economic activity." Mr. Uribe also says that "permanent monetary shocks are estimated to be the main drivers of inflation, explaining 45 percent of the variance of changes in inflation."

The pace of U.S. economic growth cooled a bit in the third quarter after a robust April-through-June period, economists say, but should remain well above the sluggish gains posted throughout the economic expansion.

Demand for long-lasting goods produced by U.S. factories took off in August due to an increase in aircraft orders, but an underlying measure of business investment fell.

The number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits rose last week, but remained at a historically low level, indicating Hurricane Florence likely had a fairly modest impact on the labor market.

Manufacturing in the middle of the country expanded more slowly in August from the prior month, according to a monthly survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

World trade will slow more sharply than previously expected this year and next as global tariffs rise, and may be even weaker if further levy increases are implemented, the World Trade Organization said.

The eurozone's annual rate of inflation rose further above the European Central Bank's target in September, but a measure of underlying price pressures fell, a development likely to reinforce the cautious approach policy makers are taking to withdrawing crisis-era stimulus.

Germany's labor market continued its strong streak in September, as jobless claims plunged more than expected and the unemployment rate hit a fresh record low, a trend that has been bolstering private consumption and tax receipts in Europe's largest economy.

 SEOpinion   HDAnother Recession Is Looming; And unlike in the past, the  Federal Reserve  has little room to encourage growth by reducing rates.   BYBy Martin Feldstein    WC850 words   PD28 September 2018   ET00:46   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPTen years after the Great Recession's onset, another long, deep downturn may soon roil the U.S. economy. The high level of asset prices today mirrors the earlier trend in house prices that preceded the 2008 crash; both mispricings reflect long periods of very low real interest rates caused by Federal Reserve policy. Now that interest rates are rising, equity prices will fall, dragging down household wealth, consumer spending and economic activity.

During the five-year period before the last downturn, the Fed had decreased the federal-funds rate to as low as 1%. That drove down mortgage interest rates, causing home prices to rise faster than 10% a year. When the Fed raised rates after 2004, the housing-price bubble burst within two years.
   TDAs housing prices plummeted, homeowners with highly leveraged mortgages found themselves owing substantially more than their homes were worth. They defaulted in droves, causing lenders to foreclose on their properties. Sales of the foreclosed properties forced prices even lower, leading the national house-price index to decline 30% in three years.

Banks that held mortgages and mortgage-backed bonds saw their net worths decline sharply. A total of 140 U.S. banks failed in 2009, and those that survived were terrified by how much further the market might slide. To avoid risky bets, they shied away from lending to businesses and home buyers and refused to lend to other banks whose balance sheets were also declining.

The fall in home prices from 2006-09 cut household wealth by $6 trillion. Coinciding with a stock-market crash, the erased wealth caused consumer spending to drop sharply, pushing the economy into recession. The collapse of bank lending deepened the decline and slowed the recovery to a sluggish pace.

Fast forward to today. Homes aren't as overvalued as they were in 2006, so there's little chance of an exact replay of the 2008 crisis. The principal risk now is that a stock-market slowdown could shrink consumer spending enough to push the economy into recession. Share prices are high today because long-term interest rates are extremely low. Today the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes is less than 3%, meaning the inflation-adjusted yield on those bonds is close to zero. The hunt for higher yields drives investors toward equities—driving up share prices in the process.

But long-term rates are beginning to rise and are likely to increase substantially in the near future. Though the 3% yield on 10-year Treasurys is still low, it's still twice as high as it was two years ago. It will be pushed higher as the Fed raises the short-term rate from today's 2% to its projected 3.4% in 2020. Rising inflation will further increase the long-term interest rate as investors demand compensation for their loss of purchasing power. And as annual federal spending deficits explode over the coming decade, it will take ever-higher long-term interest rates to get bond buyers to absorb the debt. It wouldn't be surprising to see the yield on 10-year Treasurys exceed 5%, with the resulting real yield rising from zero today to more than 2%.

As short- and long-term interest rates normalize, equity prices are also likely to return to historic price-to-earnings ratios. If the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 regresses to its historical average, 40% below today's level, $10 trillion of household wealth would be wiped out. The past relationship between household wealth and consumer spending suggests such a decline would reduce annual spending by about $400 billion, shrinking gross domestic product by 2%. Add in the effects on business investment, and this spending crunch would push the economy into recession.

Most recessions are short and shallow, with an average of less than a year between the start of the downturn and the beginning of the recovery. That's because the Fed usually responds to recessions by cutting the federal-funds rate substantially. But if one hits in the next few years, the Fed will not have enough room to cut rates, as the fed-funds rate is expected to rise to only 3% by 2020. There also won't be much room for a major fiscal intervention. Federal deficits are expected to exceed $1 trillion annually in the coming years, and publicly held federal debt is predicted to rise from 75% of GDP to nearly 100% by the decade's end.

This means a downturn brought on in the next few years by rising long-term interest rates would likely be deeper and longer than your average recession. Unfortunately, there's nothing at this point that the Federal Reserve or any other government actor can do to prevent that from happening.

   LPWASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his positive assessment of the U.S. economy, noting that borrowing costs remain low after officials raised interest rates for the third time this year.

In brief remarks prepared for delivery Thursday on Capitol Hill, Mr. Powell said the quarter-point rate increase announced by the Fed on Wednesday was the latest step toward returning interest rates to "levels that are normal in a healthy economy."
   TDWhile noting that the benefits of economic growth haven't reached all Americans and that the Fed has a limited capacity to address many challenges facing the U.S., he said policy makers are "doing all we can to keep the economy strong and moving forward."

"Rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans," Mr. Powell said.

Twelve out of 16 top Fed officials expect to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate once more this year, from its current level between 2% and 2.25%. Nine officials expect to raise rates at least three more times in 2019.

A decade after the financial crisis, the U.S. economy is growing at a healthy pace and unemployment and inflation are low, Mr. Powell said.

Thanks to higher requirements for capital and liquidity at major banks and other measures, the financial system is stronger and safer than before the crisis, he added.

"We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient," Mr. Powell said.

27 Sep 2018 18:49 ET  Fed Chairman Addresses Concerns About Flattening Yield Curve -- Update


By Nick Timiraos 

WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday played down concerns that bond markets were signaling rising odds of a recession.

Mr. Powell addressed concerns over the narrowing spread between short- and longer-term Treasury yields, a difference known as the yield curve.

When short-term yields rise higher than longer-term yields, the curve inverts. Over the past 50 years, a recession has almost always followed within a year or two.

The curve has flattened this year as the Fed has raised its short-term benchmark rate, and Mr. Powell said that was to be expected. The central bank's rate-setting committee voted Wednesday to raise the rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%.

"Some people have been very reasonably asking the question: If we invert the yield curve, will there be a recession?" Mr. Powell said during a question-and-answer session on Capitol Hill. Looking at the economy broadly, he said, "there's no reason to think that the probability of a recession in the next year or two is at all elevated."

Mr. Powell qualified his remarks by noting there is always some probability of a recession because many have been caused by shocks that have nothing to do with monetary policy. He spoke at a conference of Rhode Island business leaders.

Mr. Powell said the yield curve is "just one factor that you want to look at" when setting interest-rate policy.

 HDFed raises rates for 3rd time this year with 1 more expected   BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER    CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,086 words   PD27 September 2018   ET07:46   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve signaled its confidence Wednesday in the U.S. economy by raising a key interest rate for a third time this year, forecasting another rate hike before year's end and predicting that it will continue to tighten credit into 2020 to manage growth and inflation.

The Fed lifted its short-term rate — a benchmark for many consumer and business loans — by a modest quarter-point to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. It was its eighth hike since late 2015. The central bank also stuck with a previous forecast for three more rate hikes in 2019.
   TDIn a statement after its latest policy meeting, the Fed dropped phrasing it had long used that characterized its policy as "accommodative" — that is, favoring low rates. The Fed had used variations of that pledge in the seven years that it kept its key rate at a record low near zero and over the past nearly three years in which it's gradually tightened credit.

By removing that language, the Fed may be signaling its resolve to keep raising rates. In a news conference after its meeting, though, Chairman Jerome Powell said the removal of the "accommodative" language did not amount to a policy change.

"Our economy is strong," Powell declared at the start of his news conference. "Growth is running at a healthy clip, unemployment is low. The number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable, all of these are very good signs."

The chairman added, though: "That's not to say everything is perfect. The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans. Many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed."

The Fed's actions and its updated economic forecasts Wednesday had been widely anticipated. Initially, there was little reaction in the stock or bond markets. But later in the afternoon, stocks sold off, and major indexes closed modestly lower.

"The Fed stuck to script today, pushing ahead with another rate hike," said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

But Pearce added, "Our view is that officials are still underestimating just how quickly the economy is likely to lose momentum next year."

He said he expects the Fed to suspend its rate hikes by mid-2019 — and then feel compelled to cut rates by early 2020 to support the economy.

In its updated outlook Wednesday, the Fed foresees one final rate hike after 2019 — in 2020 — which would leave its benchmark at 3.4 percent. At that point, it would regard its policy as modestly restraining growth. The Fed seeks to slow the economy when it reaches full employment to prevent a tight job market from raising inflation too high.

During a late-afternoon news conference in New York, President Donald Trump said he was "not happy" about the Fed's latest rate hike. In a highly unusual move for a president, Trump has publicly complained that the Fed's rate increases could blunt his efforts to boost growth through tax cuts and deregulation.

Earlier, Powell said during his news conference that such outside criticism would have no effect on the Fed's use of rates to try to maximize employment and stabilize prices.

"We've been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people," Powell said. "My colleagues and I are focused, exclusively, on carrying out that mission."

The Fed's latest forecast predicts that the unemployment rate, now 3.9 percent, will reach 3.7 percent by the end of this year and then 3.5 percent next year. Not since the late 1960s has unemployment fallen that low.

The central bank expects unemployment to begin rising to 3.7 percent at the end of 2021. It foresees the economy growing 3.1 percent this year before slowing to 2.5 percent in 2019, 2 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021. The Fed sees the economy's long-run growth at a 1.8 percent annual rate — far below the Trump administration's projections for a sustained rate of 3 percent.

Many analysts think the economy could weaken next year, in part from the effects of the trade conflicts Trump has pursued with China, Canada, Europe and other trading partners. The tariffs Trump has imposed on imported steel and Chinese goods, in particular, complicate the Fed's decision-making.

That's because the tariffs — and the resulting retaliation from America's trading partners — could weaken the U.S. economy. The Fed would normally respond to weaker growth by cutting interest rates. But tariffs, which are an import tax, can inflate prices. And the Fed typically counters higher inflation by raising rates.

Megan Greene, global chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said she thought the tariffs were more likely to slow the economy than to accelerate inflation.

"The real risk of trade wars," Greene wrote last week, "is a hit to growth, not a boost to inflation."

Indeed, the Fed's regional banks have reported that some businesses are delaying investments until they see some resolution to the trade hostilities. In his news conference, Powell said some companies have told Fed officials that the tariffs have raised fears that supply chains will be disrupted and raw materials will cost more.

Powell said he had yet to see evidence that the administration's tariffs have raised prices for many consumers. But he said rising inflation remains a threat resulting from Trump's trade policies.

"It's a concern," Powell said. "It's a risk. You could see prices moving up. You don't see it yet. But you could see retail prices moving up. The tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they've been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices."

   LPFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell addressed the media Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018, after the central bank's decision to raise short-term interest rates for the third time this year. He discussed a range of issues, including the outlook for interest rates, strength in the U.S. economy, positive signs in labor-force participation and how financial stability risks appear to be moderate. Here is a transcript of his comments, lightly edited for length and clarity.

JEROME POWELL: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here. I am going to start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the economy, what we decided today, and then a bit about our expectations for the months ahead.
   TDOur economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip, unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. All of these are very good signs.

Of course, that's not to say that everything's perfect. The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans. Many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward. That is the best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed.

Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation? For many years this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago. As the economy has steadily gained strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that are normal in a healthy economy.

We took another step on that path today with a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates. These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans.

As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis – a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and for some their hopes and dreams. In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer. In particular, we're holding the largest banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liquidity they hold, and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take. I'm confident that this system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad. We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient.

Now let me go into more detail about the developments that motivated today's policy decision.

Both household spending and business investment are expanding briskly, and the overall growth outlook remains favorable, and several factors support this assessment. Fiscal policy is boosting the economy. Ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative. These conditions are consistent with our summary of economic projections for this meeting. The meeting of committee participants projections for the growth of real [gross domestic product] is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year. Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months – well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percent in August and has been near that level since April.

Smoothing through month-to-month variations, the labor-force participation rate remains about where it was in late 2013 – a positive sign given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on participation. We expect the job market to remain strong. And the median of committee participants' projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent, and a bit lower than that in 2019.

Overall, consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, PCE inflation, increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July. The core price index – which excludes the prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation – rose 2 percent over the same period.

The [Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee] seeks and expects to see inflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis. At any given time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent. For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we expect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections. The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 percent across the whole projection horizon.

Today, the committee raised the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percent. This action reflects the strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three years ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.

Looking ahead, today's projections show gradual interest-rate increases continuing, roughly, as foreseen in June. The meeting of participants' views on appropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June meeting. These projections play an important role in our work. My colleagues and I believe that it's useful to communicate our views on likely prospects for the economy and for policy.

We are well aware, however, that the economy regularly surprises and that even the most carefully constructed projections are highly uncertain. The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evolves, broadly, in line with the projections for growth, employment, unemployment and inflation.

If the economy were instead to falter, lower interest rates would be appropriate. Conversely, if inflationary pressures were to rise more than expected, higher interest rates would be appropriate. Right now, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook appear, roughly, balanced.

Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the committee dropped a sentence that indicated that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. This change does not signal any change in the likely path of policy. Instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations.

We still expect, as our statement says, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal-funds rate, and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I just discussed.

Thanks very much. I'm happy to take your questions.

Q: Thank you. Nick Timiraos of The Wall Street Journal.

Chair Powell, given the lags of monetary policy, I want to know how you think about ending the tightening cycle. How will you know when to stop and do you need to keep going until something in the economy breaks?

MR. POWELL: So the tightening cycle, as you know, is a reflection of the strength of the economy and it's almost three years now that we've been gradually raising rates, and I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually in a way allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates, and the fact that we're moving so gradually I think – I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we're being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases and, so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations.

Q: Thanks. Hi. Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times.

President Trump has stated publicly he's not thrilled with the interest-rate hikes. His comments didn't appear to have any impact on you or your colleagues. Were his comments discussed at your meeting, and do you have any concerns about the effect of these types of comments on the perception of the Fed's independence and your monetary policy?

MR. POWELL: So we've been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress and we've been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission. We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence.

We have disparate points of view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a context of price stability. That's what we do. We don't consider political factors or things like that, and so that's who we are, that's what we do, and that's just the way it's always going to be for us.

Q: Steve Liesman, CNBC.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you explain how – the stock market being at or near all-times high, corporate spreads being very tight, how does the level of the market factor into your decisions to raise interest rates? Is there a concern on your part? And then as sort of a second and related part, can you tell us what happens in 2020 and 2021 that – I know you can't tell us – you're shaking your head – (laughter) – that prompts – that prompts you – the Fed to think that rates need to still be above neutral in that time period? Thank you.

MR. POWELL: Sure. So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we, as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy and they're one of the many things that we take into account.

The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal-funds rate and that has – that has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest-rate curve and into financial asset prices generally. So the answer is we take – we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account.

In terms of '20 and '21, why – your question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral. So you're right, some of – some of the participants have mostly very modest overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple or three years out. You know, it's far out into the future. I think it's hard to be confident that that's – that that's the way things are going to be.

What we're going to be doing as we – as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals. And I think that that's an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road. And I'll leave it at that.

Q: Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters.

Chairman Powell, I think – is this too good to be true? Because you've got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent, very low, substantially below NAIRU [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment], what appears to be NAIRU, but no reaction of inflation there. And so I don't think that's ever happened since the 1960s. Why do you think it's going to happen now? Or in the alternative, is this forecast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence intervals to the extent that, well, we don't know what else to do so just extend the line out until something happens?

MR. POWELL: No, you're right, the committee forecasts what they – what they show in general is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent. That is what the forecast shows. And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now on the – on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack, that is to say a flat Phillips curve. And it's just – it's a – it's a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations. And that's not just our forecasts, that's many forecasts. So that is – that is – that is the forecast.

So you may ask – I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean? And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run. But obviously, that longer run, you know, it's not creating problems in the short run for that forecast.

Now, let's just admit that the inflation process has changed dramatically from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It's in a good place now. We can't take for granted that it will remain the way it is. And, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully if inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly...then we'll adjust policy appropriately.

Q: If I – if I could follow up on that. What are you buying with interest rates –

MR. POWELL: Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effects – I mean, if – I guess your question was, what are you buying by raising interest rates? The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn't raise rates? It would look very different, I think, if you didn't raise rates.

We're always trying to, you know, work our way between sort of the two – the two problems we face. One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target. Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat. So we're – that's happened through history, we don't see any signs of that now, but we're always trying to navigate between those two shoals and we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously.

Q: Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.

The Fed has recently been saying that financial stability risks are moderate. What kind of developments could prompt a change in that assessment to elevated risks? And is there an argument for moving the countercyclical capital buffer even when risks are moderate rather than waiting until the risks are seen as elevated, which arguably could be too late? Thanks.

MR. POWELL: So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importance of the stability of the financial system. And so we – since the financial crisis, as you're aware, we've had a major focus on building up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial stability issues. We've also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system through higher capital and better regulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that which are meant to strengthen the financial system. We've done many of those things, and we feel that the financial system's in a much better place.

As we look at – as we look at conditions most recently – and this was at our last meeting and it was in our – in our minutes for the last meeting – quarterly, we have a briefing at the FOMC and also at the board of the staff's views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate. If you dig into the different aspects of that question, households' balance sheets are in good shape, you know, employment is high, wages are rising, that sort of thing. The banking system, as I mentioned, has, you know, much higher capital, much higher liquidity, is much stronger. If you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historical – upper reach of their historical ranges. And then, if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you get – there is the story of leverage there. So it's not that there aren't any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate.

Now, you asked about the countercyclical capital buffer. The countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our tool kit I think, finally, back in 2016. We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal. We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we revisited it was, I think, last year – sometime last year, and concluded that the test was not met. As I mentioned at the last briefing, the – you know, the assessment was that vulnerabilities were moderate. But it remains a kit – a tool for our tool kit that we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate.

Q: Do you see the chances of needing to deploy it as increased?

MR. POWELL: As I said, I think I'm in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate. I think the financial system – I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues.

I don't see that in troubling amounts at this point. But, you know, I think it's appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully.

Q: Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.

The researchers at the European Central Bank this week put out a paper saying that the impact of a trade war on the U.S. could be dire, that the U.S. economy could drop by 2 percent in the first year after a widespread trade war. Could you talk about the discussion you had? Your policy statement doesn't mention the trade tensions. You did not mention them. Do you – what kind of outlook do you have right now for the trade war?

MR. POWELL: Sure. So I guess I need to start by saying that we're not responsible for trade policy and we don't comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing.

But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the reserve banks largely, and we have been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials cost increases, and loss of markets, and things like that. So we've been hearing quite a lot of that, and we – the reserve bank presidents talk about it in the meeting and it goes in the minutes. So we – you know, that's – we're very transparent about hearing all of that.

I think if you look at the aggregate – the performance of the U.S. economy at an aggregate, at a national level, it's hard to see much happening at this point. Or you can look at it the other way. You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been announced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate level, and they're still relatively small.

You know, we worry about a couple of things. One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment. Again, we don't really see effects that we can measure yet. Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to unexpected trade developments.

More than anything, though, I would worry in the longer run where this is going. You know, if the – if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good. You know, I think trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes. And, you know, fair trade – fair trade under internationally accepted rules – can be a good thing. I think if this – perhaps inadvertently – goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time, a more protectionist world, that's going to be bad for the United States economy and for American workers and families, and also for other economies.

Q: Hi. Heather Long from the Washington Post.

This is the third time this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecast. I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what's causing that rise and whether you see supply side effects coming through from the fiscal policy, fiscal stimulus yet. Thanks.

MR. POWELL: So it's true. This year has – we've kept raising our forecast for this year. As the year's gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that's a really good thing. And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and there's good reason to expect that to continue.

You ask why. You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy changes, the tax cuts, and the spending increases. That's got to be part of the story. Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling forth more investment in the oil patch. But, you know, the growth picture is very much supported by very high readings of household confidence, business confidence. So it's a pretty particularly bright moment, I think. If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy.

Q: The supply-side effect?

MR. POWELL: Oh, supply-side effects, yeah. So, you know, we hope they're huge, frankly. You know, the idea is you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly – and allow faster expensing for investment. The idea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes. So the effects are very uncertain. You know, the literature, there's no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are. And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects. The supply-side effects are probably both more uncertain and they're probably slower to come in. But, you know, as I said, I certainly hope that we'll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well.

Q: Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.

Taking a page from your risk-management approach in Jackson Hole, Mr. Chairman, I'm wondering if you can talk about what risks would make the committee – plausible risk – go faster in 2019. What risks would make them go slower? If you could talk about scenarios. And then I'd like to ask, do you see yourself as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, possibly cutting rates to soft land the economy? I know the forecast doesn't show that, but I'm curious how you soft land without doing that.

MR. POWELL: OK. So I think I mentioned in the opening remarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower. You know, the main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker would be if inflation surprises to the upside. We don't see that. We really don't see that. It's not in our forecast. So I regard that as a risk. I think either significant and lasting correction in financial markets, or a slowing down in the economy that's inconsistent with our forecast – those are the kinds of things we'd react to.

In terms of what – you know, what we would do. You know, I think we're always going to be adjusting monetary policy to – in light of conditions on the ground. So if the economy's weakening, then it's very possible we'd be cutting rates and, you know, vice versa. So I can't rule that out. I think it's quite difficult, though, to know what the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be in 2020. It's difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what the effects will be that far out. So we have to make estimates, but we know that they're highly uncertain.

Q: Hi, Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you, chairman.

The unemployment rate's now 3.9 percent. The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent over the past 12 months. Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady. With the amount of job vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this year, where is the point at which we're actually above the natural rate of unemployment and the Federal Reserve should re-examine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward, so not to cool an expanding economy?

MR. POWELL: You mean where is the point at which unemployment is too low?

Q: Right, exactly.

MR. POWELL: Yeah, yeah. You know, so we've been – I think the labor-force participation has surprised us on the upside. There is a long-run trend there and we've now had basically five flat years. If you look – if you look at labor-force participation since the fourth quarter of '13 to now, you really have kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a – of a significant downward trend thanks to aging and other factors. That's a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation. So that's really – that's really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs. So that's a great thing.

And it – and it – and it – by the way, it's a signal. It's one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further. And it's a – it's a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate. So it's a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force. And, you know, we don't know how long it can continue. We have models and we look at this – we look at this question all the time. And, you know, admittedly, we've been surprised on the – on the positive side here, so we're open to the idea that that may continue or not.

Q: Hi, Jerome. Donna Borak with CNN.

Just to follow up on the tariff question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariffs so far haven't quite materialized. Those weren't your words verbatim. But Walmart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy's have all said that they expect the tariffs to affect the prices of everyday consumer goods. So my question is, should there be an effect, when you expect to see that? And at what point do you start to become worried that it's actually going to affect consumer spending and dampening economic growth?

MR. POWELL: It's a concern; it's a risk. You know, so you could see prices moving up. We don't see it yet, but you could see retail prices moving up. The tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they've been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices, where raising prices is really difficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet. This could provide, you know, a way for – again, we don't see it in the numbers. And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it's hard to say how one would react.

And the other question would be, if you're just talking about the effect on inflation, is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward? And that's a real – that's an important question in how we would think about the appropriate response.

Q: But is there a sense of timing in terms of when you might see that kick in, the effect of?

MR. POWELL: I don't see it yet. You know, don't see it yet. But we – you're hearing – I mean, broadly across the economy, it's not just tariffs. You're hearing, we're hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries. We're hearing, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that. But we're not seeing it. We're seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we're not seeing it yet and, you know, we just aren't. And we're watching very carefully.

Q: Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.

Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measures that track that. The flow of funds shows a decline in short-term borrowing other than in Treasurys. So I'm wondering if that suggests a change in the way Fed tightening affects the economy. And along those lines, you mentioned that – you dropped the word accommodative doesn't suggest a change in policy. But if you're dropping forward guidance in terms of accommodative, does the dot plot really serve any purpose anymore if, as you say, you can't be confident out to 2021 what's going to happen with the economy?

MR. POWELL: A couple of questions in there. So the dot plot, I mean, it's not new, I don't think it's a new point that forecasts two and three years out – two or three years out are fairly uncertain. The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy. We don't vote on that, these are individual forecasts. I think market participants generally find that interesting information, so it seems to me to be serving a purpose.

I think the point with accommodative was that its useful life was over. You know, we put that in the statement in 2015 just when we lifted off and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren't trying to slow down the economy, but in fact we were still – interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity. Well, that – you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn't really say anything that's important to the way the committee is thinking about policy going forward. That's why that came out.

Did I get – did get all of your –

Q: The idea that financial conditions remain loose, even though you've raised rates 200 basis.

MR. POWELL: Yeah. Yeah, you know, it's – if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that's pretty much the answer you'll get. We don't control that. And as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do. And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so by definition we're taking them into account.

But if you look at – look at interest rates, you know. Interest rates – look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term interest rates this year, very significant increases. And, you know, with your long and variable lags, that should be – that should be having an effect over time.

Q: Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico.

So Nellie Liang was just put forward by President Donald Trump to the Fed board. And I'm just curious, you know, given that she's a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could speak to what role you played in, you know, recommending candidates to the president, giving input on who he should nominate?

And then also, if I – if I may follow up on the financial stability discussion from earlier, you know, you've mentioned before that corporate debt is at high levels. And I was curious whether, you know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on leveraged lending by making that guidance less of a – less of a cudgel, I guess, while – at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam.

MR. POWELL: OK. So, in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the president. And traditionally, the Fed chair has been consulted on those, and I'm happy to say that that has continued. But these are – these are really decisions for the White House and, you know, we are – think of us as just being consulted.

I will say that I'm very happy and excited about the team that we're putting together, and I'm very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled. It's been pretty quiet, more – quieter than usual, which is saying something, on the board hall. So we're looking forward to getting some people confirmed.

In terms of corporate debt, so this is a – this is a – you know, I was an investor for a long time, and in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending market. So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that. That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis. And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to. They're essentially in the – in the business of distributing these loans and bonds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet to a much greater degree.

But it's also true – and there's significant research on this – that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy if there's overheating and that kind of thing in those markets. So we monitor that carefully.

You know, the guidance isn't binding, as you pointed out. The leveraged lending isn't binding, and that's just the – that's just the way that the law is interpreted.

So it's something we're monitoring. And as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate.

Q: Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.

If I can come back to accommodative, do you think of policy as accommodative as present? How close are you to neutrality? And do you share the view of some of your colleagues that you'll eventually need to be restrictive?

MR. POWELL: OK. So are we accommodative now? So I think if you look at the – look at the dot plot and the [Fed's summary of economic projections], you'll see that the federal-funds rate even after today's move is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that – who submits an estimate of that. So that's why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it's perfectly clear that there can't be a signal because, you know, by definition that means an accommodative policy. So it wasn't because policy's not accommodative; it is still accommodative. The thinking was more – as I mentioned, it's more that the language has run its useful life.

There's another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don't want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where accommodative stops or suggest that that's a really important point in our thinking. You know, what we're going to be doing, assuming we stay on this path, is we're going to be carefully monitoring incoming data from the financial markets and from the economy and asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieve: you know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices. That's the way we're thinking about it. That does kind of amount to thinking less about one's precise point estimate of the neutral rate. So that's how I think about that.

Q: Well, the second question is just do you think you're going to end up in a restrictive posture?[Fed] Governor [Lael] Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you will need to do that. Do you agree with her?

MR. POWELL: It's possible. It's very possible. It happens often and, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down and they've written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn't have a big effect on the economy.

You know, I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens. It depends on if we keep going – you can think of it in different ways. Maybe we've underestimated the neutral rate, maybe we'll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we'll just go to that, or maybe we'll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it.

I think it's very possible. But, I mean, ultimately, it isn't really the question we're answering. The question we're answering is how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support – not too much, not too little – to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals.

Q: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greg Robb from MarketWatch.

The 10-year anniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month. I was wondering if you thought there were any lessons from the crisis that you want to share, and two points on that. You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress.

Now, [former Treasury] Secretary [Hank] Paulson and Mr. [Timothy] Geithner [former New York Fed president and former Treasury secretary] and [former Fed] Chair [Ben] Bernanke have said that Congress made a mistake when it took away the Fed's emergency powers in Dodd-Frank. And then one other thing is that are you confident that all these nonbanks didn't – you know, nonbanks never got put into the – you know, the [Financial Stability Oversight Council], you know, system. So are you confident that you can see the risks in the financial system?

Thank you.

MR. POWELL: So three things there. The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the – as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system. So I think if you look – if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that's what was missing and I think it's not missing anymore. So we – you know, we've put a tremendous focus on that. We raised capital, liquidity. We have stress tests, which force banks to understand – the largest banks, particularly – to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that's at least as bad as the financial crisis. And if all that doesn't work, we've got resolution plans which we've – you know, through many cycles have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely.

So we've done a lot. Nobody's – you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we solved every problem and, you know, now we're going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to make – trying to keep at it.

So I think those are the really important lessons and, you know, we were determined not to – you know, not to forget them. And that's – I think a risk now is to forget things that we – that we learned – that's just human nature – over time.

I saw the article you're talking about. The question is, did Congress take things away – emergency powers from the Fed? So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under 13 – Section 13(3) to provide support to individual nonbanks, which is really holding companies and other companies. In exchange for that we got orderly liquidation authority and a resolution authority.

Was it a mistake? I don't think there's any sense that Congresses would seriously look at changing that. I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools. I think you put them away and you hope you never need them again but – and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools.

You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power so it's a really important power. In my mind, it should be used – my thinking it should be used sparingly and that means, you know, in situations where you have – I mean, in principle you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that's not a bank and it could be very threatening or it could be capable of creating systemic risk, and so I think it's a critical power to have. But, again, I would use it – I would tend to use it fairly sparingly.

Q: Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.

Are you worried about the effect of rising interest rates on consumers? Credit-card rates have jumped to more than 17 percent since the Fed started raising interest rates. Mortgage rates are up. What do you say to consumers?

MR. POWELL: Yeah. We look – of course, we look at that very carefully. And interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates. They're still quite low by historical levels. And the other thing I'll say is take – if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis.

So you're right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it's going up from what were extraordinarily low levels. And it is something that we watch carefully. You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through which interest rates work. And so we do monitor the effects.

Q: Hi. Hannah Lang, American Banker.

[The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's] decision to go at [Community Reinvestment Act] loans suggests that there's some sort of disagreement among how to proceed with the joint plan. What are the issues that are preventing the joint plan from developing? And how close are you to a possible joint plan?

MR. POWELL: Well, at the Fed we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve. And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology, particularly, and changes in the nature of banking, that it's an appropriate time – it's past an appropriate time. It now is certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA.

But we don't want to lose that focus on community. And, you know, we definitely want to see the fundamental purpose of the law sustained.

Many of the issues that we had were reflected in the OCC's [advance notice of proposed rulemaking]. And we're hopeful that over time there will be a joint proposed rulemaking with the OCC, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.] and the Fed. It's a process. And, you know, we're very much interested in continuing to push it forward.

Q: Steve Beckner, freelance journalist, filing for NPR.

Mr. Chairman, following up on the neutral-rate issue – and you touched on this – you and your colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral funds rate estimate, to 3 percent. But that's still, I believe, like, 125 basis points below where it was six years ago.

What are the odds that productivity – you know, investment, productivity, labor market, and other developments could further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the projected funds-rate levels less restrictive than they now seem?

MR. POWELL: So in principle the historic variables – the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment – don't move quickly. They move very gradually. They're pinned down by longer-run forces like demographics. In the case of the funds rate, it's productivity. It's appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things too. So they move quite slowly through time.

I think we all look at them, those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a change every quarter, but every now and again make a change. And you're right. We actually – the median ticked up a tenth. It's a tenth we're talking about here.

So but still I think it's a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of a longer-run neutral rate, and potentially the longer-run growth rate – who knows – and maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend. It's just that you change those estimates over time. They're informed by incoming data. They don't change a lot, though, although they did – it's interesting that the neutral rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many different models, and it's been slow to recover. I don't expect a dramatic recovery there.

But, you know, we – we're so bad at forecasting productivity, it's just very hard to know when productivity is going to arrive and in what quantity. So I think we have to be humble about how little we really know about where these starred variables either are or are going.

Q: Hi, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thank you for taking the question.

I'd like to just kind of ask again – you mentioned earlier that gradual – a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react. But specifically, what are you going to be looking to see? Because you also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag. So any kind of specific signposts that maybe we've reached the end of the tightening cycle or where we should stop?

Secondly, if you worry about the divergence between interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a time when emerging markets are under pressure. Thanks.

MR. POWELL: Sure. So, you know, some of the things that we'd be looking at to tell us whether we're getting close to supply-side limits would be, first, does job growth slow down? A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know. An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you're reaching those points. You know, if headline growth slowed down, that's another one. So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration.

I think also, though, we've seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it's a broad and significant tightening. So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things.

So in terms of divergence, yes, so the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, healthy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned. And we've seen growth abroad, but growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed down a little bit. And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stronger, then that's just part of the context, part of the environment that could mean a higher dollar, it could be – it could therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies. That's the way the integrated international economy works. So you could see that and, you know, it's just – it's just all of the – all things that go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy.

I would say, you know, we're not responsible for the dollar. Of course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dollar. But the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017. It's moved up off its lows, but it's not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin.

Q: Hi. Jean Yung with Market News International.

Can you give us an update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary policy that the Fed made earlier this year when it decoupled the interest on excess reserves rate from the upper bound of the target range? And have you been happy with that adjustment? And do you see the need to make another such adjustment in the near future?

MR. POWELL: So we've said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal-funds rate trades within the target range. And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then – and then at the bottom end a reverse repo facility. So we – in June when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25 and that moved federal-funds sort of back into the range. It worked and it was successful. The federal-funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range.

We may – we may do that again. You know, we, again, we have our tools and we will use them. We think it's principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasurys supply, which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well. So we don't see it as a – as a – as a big problem. We see it as a problem we can address with our tools and we'll use them if we have to.

Q: Hi, Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios.

Last month, the [White House's Council of Economic Advisers] outlined a different way to calculate wage growth. Has the Fed looked at that at all? And what are you seeing in terms of non-wage-based compensation?

MR. POWELL: So I wouldn't comment on a CEA paper. And I would imagine they probably wouldn't comment on our stuff either.

But I would just say this. So I am familiar with the – with the question and the work. You know, we look – we look at a range of indicators of wages and I think the broader the better. You really – a perfect – a perfect wage measure would also include benefits because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages. So I think it's right to choose those broader ones. But they're kind of all telling the same story right now. If you look at the principal four that we look at, we look at a whole range of wage and benefit cost indicators. They are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right clustered around 3 percent. That's a full percentage point higher than it was five years ago. That's a good thing.

Then the question – the other question is, what about inflation? You know, if you're looking for real wage increases, you've got to ask inflation. And there you have to pick an inflation measure. Some people pick [the consumer-price index]. We, of course, pick personal-consumption expenditures because we think it's a little better measure, it's a little broader. And it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that's not why we pick it. We just think it's more accurate.

And the trend there is running around 2 percent. So if wages are running at – wages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and inflation running at around 2 percent, PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent, PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see the – you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices, probably, and we expect inflation go to back down to 2 percent. So we think of that as 2 percent.

That's how we think about it. I hope that helps.

Q: Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.

Chair Powell, I want to follow up on something you said, actually, at Jackson Hole. You were talking about longer-term structural challenges for the economy and you mentioned that adjusting the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. I'm just wondering if you can, you know, maybe expand on your thoughts there, and if this is an issue that comes up among members of the FOMC at all.

MR. POWELL: So it doesn't really come up. It's not really our job. And we do – we do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing. We don't have responsibility for fiscal policy. But in the longer run, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy. So for that reason, I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy, but they've commented on – at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular – you know, particular measures. And so – and I – my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane.

And, you know, so I would just say it's no secret it's been true for a long time that with the – with our uniquely expensive health care delivery system and the aging of our population, we've been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time. And there's no hiding from it; in the end, we will have to face that. And I think, you know, the sooner the better.

And also, these are good times. These are – you know, this is – this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range, in the neighborhood of full employment. Interest rates are low. It's a good time to be addressing these things. So I just – I put that out there and leave it at that.

Q: I'm Takesh Khan (ph) with – (inaudible) – newspaper. Thank you for taking my question.

I'd like to ask about emerging market. What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emerging market, especially currency depression or capital – the flow from the emerging countries?

And do you think there is a possibility to stop the interest-rate hike due to emerging market turmoil – due to turmoil of emerging market?

MR. POWELL: Sorry, the second question was?

Q: There is a possibly to stop the interest-rate hike.

MR. POWELL: Oh, to stop, OK. All right.

Well, we serve a domestic mandate which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices...[and] the performance of the emerging market economies, really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate.

I'd also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy where Americans are buying things and the economy is growing and our – you know, that's going to support demand all around the globe. So that's a good thing.

Now, we do understand, though, that when we – when our economy is strong and we're raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have significant external dollar borrowing. And what we try to do is be very transparent about what we're doing and why, and we have been I believe, and we've also moved quite gradually. So I – you know, I think we've been performing well on that front.

There are some countries that are – that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, and – but not most emerging market countries. It's a relatively small number. And those particular countries have – you know, have particular vulnerabilities which are well known in the form of budget deficits and significant external dollar borrowings and high inflation and things like that.

So, again, well continue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we possibly can. And that's really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth.

I'll just – I think that answers both your questions, actually.

Q: Jeannie Monte (sp) with Agence France-Presse.

You mentioned earlier a possible, not probable, correction. And I want to come back to the high level of the stock market. Are there any participants to the FOMC who think that we are witnessing an episode of irrational exuberance or rational exuberance? And if there was a steep correction, would it provoke financial stability concerns?

MR. POWELL: So I don't comment on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices. I can say that, by some valuation measures, they're in the upper range of their historical value ranges. But, you know, I wouldn't want to – I wouldn't want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be.

You know, we would look very carefully at the nature of it. And, I mean, really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value. So that's a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values falling. We know that that's a really bad situation.

A simple drop in equity prices is – all by itself doesn't really have those features. It could certainly feature – it could certainly affect consumption and have a negative effect on the economy, though.

Q: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with BankRate.com.

One thing that's changed since the crisis is the majority of mortgages issued last year came from so-called nonbank lenders, as traditional banks scaled back. What confidence do you have about supervision, and I suppose also regulation in this space, given the role of housing finance in the crisis? Thank you.

MR. POWELL: It's a good question. So you're right that a lot of mortgages now originate outside the system. Many of those, though, have to meet certain basic standards to be bought by the [government-sponsored enterprises]. I think we – if we look at mortgage credit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit, good credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history.

You know, it's – have we set – have we got that exactly right? I don't know. I mean, I – but that's clearly – that's the reality.

In terms of those institutions, they do have supervision by the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] and other state regulators. But you're right. They're – much of the origination process has moved outside the banking system. It's something we monitor.

 SEEconomy   HDThe Fed Isn't the Supreme Court. Thank Goodness; In a charged partisan environment in Washington, the central bank remains for now an apolitical island   BYBy Greg Ip    WC897 words   PD27 September 2018   ET17:52   SNWSJ Pro Central Banking   SCRSTPROCB   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPWhile many Americans are riveted on the Supreme Court this week, they might have missed an action by another federal institution that will affect almost every household.

That the Federal Reserve's \b interest rate\b0  increase drew relatively little attention is a good thing. As American institutions from the courts to law enforcement have become partisan battlegrounds, the central bank for now is an island of dull, apolitical competence.
   TDA few years ago, this didn't seem likely. The Fed emerged from the financial crisis under attack from the left for bailing out bankers and from the right for unconventional policies to hold down interest rates and stimulate spending.

As a candidate, Donald Trump joined in with his own attacks. As president, he had an unprecedented opportunity to appoint bomb throwers or partisan loyalists to the top positions at the central bank, including chairman and vice chairman.

He didn't.

He has nominated mainstream, qualified candidates who have mostly drawn praise from outside economists and Fed watchers. It isn't a guarantee the Fed won't err—by raising interest rates too slowly or too quickly—but it provides essential stability to the economy's most important institution.

It helped that the partisan activists who care deeply about the judiciary, law enforcement, the environment and immigration were less invested in the Fed.

Some Republican legislators did believe former Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her predecessors had kept interest rates too low and lobbied for John Taylor, a Stanford University economist, to succeed her. But Mr. Trump actually liked Ms. Yellen; he just wanted her policies carried out by his own appointee.

Stephen Moore, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation who advised the president to select Mr. Taylor, says, "Trump was worried that Taylor would be too hawkish on inflation."

Instead, Mr. Trump nominated Jerome Powell, a Republican previously appointed to the Fed by Barack Obama and championed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mr. Trump seems surprised Mr. Powell has continued raising interest rates. "I'm worried about the fact that they seem to like rising interest rates," he said Wednesday. "We can do other things with the money."

Despite his public grumbling, Mr. Trump hasn't pressured Mr. Powell by nominating loyalists to vacancies on the Fed's board of governors.

The search process for Fed candidates began soon after Mr. Trump took office and was coordinated by Andrew Olmem, a former Capitol Hill staffer who is now deputy director of the National Economic Council.

The result has been a slate of governors with complementary backgrounds in monetary policy, bank regulation, management and financial market stability. Three—Richard Clarida, a monetary economist; Randal Quarles, a banking lawyer; and Michelle Bowman, Kansas' banking commissioner—are Republicans. Nonetheless, all were backed by some Democratic senators.

Last week Mr. Trump nominated Nellie Liang, a former Fed staffer specializing in financial stability, for the board's last vacancy. Some Republicans wonder if Ms. Liang, a registered Democrat, may be too fond of regulation. But she has drawn praise from conservatives, such as at the Manhattan Institute, a think tank.

It is too soon to judge the impact of Mr. Trump's appointees. And controversy is inevitable, over both interest rates and regulation. Democrats criticized the Fed's decision to offer Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley a pass on recent "stress tests" (though Lael Brainard, the only remaining Obama appointee on the board, backed the move.) But the Fed has moved more gradually to ease rules than Trump appointees at some other financial regulators.

Fed officials have also been helped by the central bank's deeply ingrained tradition of nonpartisanship. Republican legislators often criticized Ms. Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke; they didn't fire back, but nor did they change course. Mr. Powell has done the same, refusing to wade into charged topics such as tariffs and tax cuts except insofar as they affect the Fed's job.

The Fed's culture has a way of absorbing newcomers. While federal judges bring their own clerks and cabinet secretaries their undersecretaries, Fed chiefs come alone. Their advisers and secretaries are drawn from the existing central bank staff, which reinforces continuity (and group think, say critics).

Mr. Powell has recruited Johns Hopkins University academic Jon Faust as an adviser, but they got to know each other when Mr. Faust served on the Fed staff. That staff is itself relatively diverse ideologically; Ms. Yellen, once chairwoman of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, was once a staffer, as was Kevin Hassett, now chairman of Mr. Trump's CEA.

In its approach to policy, however, the Fed is rather homogenous. "We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence," Mr. Powell said Wednesday. "We don't consider political factors or things like that, and so that's who we are, that's what we do, and that's just the way it's always going to be for us."

 HDUS mortgage rates up; 30-year at 7-year high 4.72 percent   WC349 words   PD27 September 2018   ET17:57   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates are up for the fifth straight week, with the key 30-year rate reaching its highest level in more than seven years.

Costs for would-be homebuyers continue to climb. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 4.72 percent from 4.65 percent last week. The average benchmark rate has risen from 3.83 percent a year ago.
   TDThe average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans increased to 4.16 percent this week from 4.11 percent last week.

The Federal Reserve signaled its confidence in the economy on Wednesday by raising a key interest rate for a third time this year, forecasting another rate hike before year's end.

The strong economy and anticipation of more short-term rate hikes by the Fed are helping drive the increase in mortgage rates.

Economists believe the country is on track for annual growth this year of around 3 percent. That would be the best performance since 2005, three years before the 2008 financial crisis pushed the U.S. into the worst recession since the 1930s.

To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week.

The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates.

The average fee on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was unchanged from last week at 0.5 point. The fee on 15-year mortgages also remained at 0.5 point.

The average rate for five-year adjustable-rate mortgages rose to 3.97 percent from 3.92 percent last week. The fee slipped to 0.3 point from 0.4 point.

   LPThe ‘Dot Plot' Reveals Two Policy Directions

By Nick Timiraos
   TDIt's generally a mistake to obsess over the interest-rate projections—the so-called dot plot—in the out-years of the Federal Reserve's quarterly economic projections. Nevertheless, the projections released Wednesday highlight two different directions policy could move after next year.

Most Fed officials see the central bank raising rates by another percentage point through next year. The question then turns on what happens after that, when rates will be well within the range officials currently estimate is likely to prevail over the long run.

Looking ahead to 2020, the median projection shows just one more rate increase, to a range between 3.25% and 3.5%.

Look closer, and there are only two officials who project such a level of interest rates. Rather, there's a cluster of seven officials who expect the Fed will need to raise rates above 3.5% and another cluster that says rates shouldn't need to rise beyond 3.25%.

The split likely reflects different opinions over how inflation is likely to behave. Wednesday's projections show all officials see inflation holding between 2% and 2.3% over the next three years. The dot plot shows, however, that officials expect a different rate will be needed to keep inflation at that range.

The strength of the Phillips curve could largely determine which of the two camps prevails. The first camp says so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level they project is consistent with low and stable inflation, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion.

Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials say if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth, even if unemployment remains at very low levels.

Mr. Powell didn't say where he stood on Wednesday, but he continued to voice some uncertainty over the traditional models that have animated the Fed's thinking. "Let's just admit that the inflation process has changed, dramatically, from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It's in a good place now," he said.

Officials will be "watching carefully," he said. "If inflation reacts more strongly, or more weakly, to the strong economy, then we'll adjust policy appropriately."

Fed Raises Interest Rates, Signals One More Increase This Year

The Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates by another quarter-percentage point, and officials signaled they expected to lift them again later this year and through 2019 to keep a strong economy on an even keel. Officials voted unanimously Wednesday on the increase, which will bring the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%. Most Fed officials expected to raise rates one more time this year, according to new projections released after the meeting. "Our economy is strong," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a news conference.

Bank Suit Could Complicate the Fed's Rate Policy

A lawsuit against the New York Fedcould complicate the central bank's effort to control short-term interest rates at a time when investor scrutiny of those markets is intensifying. TNB USA Inc. contends in a federal suit filed in late August that it has been wrongly blocked in its pursuit of a "master account" at the Fed that would allow it to earn interest on deposits placed on the Fed's books.

Czech Central Bank Raises Rates Again

The Czech National Bankraised its key \b interest rate\b0  for the sixth time in just over a year, cementing its position as the most dynamic of Europe's central banks in charting a path back toward policy settings that were considered normal before the global financial crisis.

Bank Indonesia Hikes for Fifth Time Since May

Bank Indonesiaraised interest rates for the fifth time since May, and said it would introduce trade in domestic non-deliverable forwards for the rupiah to reduce exchange-rate volatility. The central bank raised the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75%.

New Zealand Central Bank Keeps Rates On Ice

New Zealand's central bankleft its benchmark \b interest rate\b0  unchanged while continuing to leave its options open for the future, saying the next move could be up or down. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand held its benchmark official cash rate at 1.75% as expected by economists, a level it has been maintained at for nearly two years.

Philippines Central Bank Raises Interest Rates

The Philippine central bankraised overnight interest rates, as expected, citing rising inflation. The central bank's benchmark lending rate was raised to 5.0% from 4.5%, while the borrowing rate is now at 4.5% from 4.0%. All 11 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a rate increase.

How the Fed Can Help Working Women

Tame inflation and restrained wage growth aren't the only reasons why the Fed should take it easy on rate increases, Karl W. Smith writes for Bloomberg Opinion. "Historically, tight labor markets have tended to empower the less privileged, particularly women and minorities. The Fed should be careful not to undercut this trend before it has a chance to affect women throughout the job market." He adds that "an improvement in women's employment status has corresponded with an increased willingness of women to challenge abuses in the workplace. The social dynamics underlying this movement are of course complex. But if one of the factors preventing women from speaking out was fear of losing their job or damaging their career, then a robust labor market can help. It cannot remove these threats, but it can soften them."

1041 ET - It's "too soon" to talk about U.S. dollar weakness, BNP Paribas says. "The Fed's message of continued tightening suggests it remains too soon to look for a resumption of trend dollar weakness." The 'Goldilocks' scenario of U.S. Federal Reserveinterest rate increases and rising global growth is likely to continue for longer, although the Fed is expected to raise rates only twice next year, says BNP Paribas. Still, "the fiscal hangover, trade wars, and tighter monetary policy could restrain growth in 2019 by more than the Fed expects, resulting in an earlier pause in the hiking cycle than its forecast." This would mean an earlier end to the dollar strength. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)
   TD1012 ET - Julius Baer upgrades emerging market hard-currency bonds to overweight from neutral based on attractive absolute and relative valuations. "Compensation for the risk has improved following weakness since the start of the year," say fixed income analysts Markus Allenspach and Alejandro Hardziej. Looking at type and maturity breakdown, Julius Baer prefers corporate over sovereign exposure, and short- and medium-term maturies over long-dated debt. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0956 ET - Halfords Group may face an uphill task to turn round rival Evans, says Hargreaves Lansdown, following media reports that the car and bike accessory chain had made an offer to buy the struggling cycle retailer. "Halfords investors should be aware that Evans, which attracted a valuation of GBP100 million as recently as 2015, needs stabilizing," says HL's George Salmon. "Recent difficulties mean around GBP10 million is likely needed to keep the wheels turning and more investment would surely be required to effect a full turnaround." Halfords shares fall 8.6%. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0938 ET - Treasurys are near flat, holding gains from Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve meeting where it raised short-term rates for the third time this year. Though the meeting offered few surprises, its passage removed a risk overhanging the market, encouraging buyers to step off the sidelines. Adding to this dynamic is the approaching end to the third quarter, which could prompt investors to add more Treasurys to de-risk their portfolios. After nearly topping its 2018 closing high of 3.109% on Tuesday, the 10-year yield was recently 3.067% vs. 3.059% Wednesday. (sam.goldfarb@wsj.com)

0919 ET - A no-deal Brexit, where the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29 without a trade agreement, could turn sterling rapidly into an emerging market-type currency, says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst. "It could change the U.K. from a developed country to an emerging market country overnight," he says. As seen with Turkey and Argentina recently, emerging-market economies can be forced to raise interest rates to stem sharp falls in their currencies or assets, despite this harming the economy. Mr. Cook said the Bank of England would likely cut rates after a no-deal Brexit to mitigate economic damage, but steep sterling falls could necessitate rate rises. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)

0902 ET-A noticeable pickup in German inflation in September was led by higher prices for energy and food. "We find little in the report to suggest mounting medium-term underlying pressures, as most of the September rise was driven by volatile components," says Fabio Fois, an economist at Barclays. Germany's annual inflation rate--measured by harmonized EU standards--rose to 2.2% in September, beating economists' forecasts of 2.0%. Energy prices in Germany rose 7.7% from September last year, while food prices where 2.8% higher, according to the statistics body. (nina.adam@wsj.com, @Nina_Adam_)

0842 ET - Growth in US corporate profits moderated in 2Q compared with the first, according to the government's broad estimate of profits at US companies. A Commerce Department report shows after-tax corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, a measure of profits from production that quarter, rose 2.1% in 2Q from the prior quarter after rising 8.2% in 1Q. It appears the tax legislation passed last December, which included a corporate tax rate cut, provided a boost to profits in 1Q but that this moderated in 2Q. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com)

0830 ET - Airlines could face cash-flow problems if the U.K. crashes out of the EU without a deal, says Moody's. The credit rating agency says carriers could lose traffic rights between the U.K. and the European Common Aviation Area, as well as between the U.K. and third countries with EU aviation agreements. Companies would also need to act to ensure they keep valid operating licenses. The agency's Jeanine Arnold says it could hit airlines' yields, load factors and cost-cutting potential. "Ultimately it could lead to cash flow and liquidity pressures," she adds. Airlines most at risk include International Consolidated Airlines Group-owned British Airways, EasyJet, Ryanair Holdings, Thomas Cook Group, TUI and Virgin Atlantic, Moody's says. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0807 ET - Miners drop alongside metals prices after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates and Chinese corporate profits slowed. Glencore is the sector's top faller on the FTSE 100, down 1.9% as the three-month price of copper declined 1.1% to $6,217 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, with nickel, zinc and lead also retreating. "The FOMC release and subsequent swings in the dollar have seen base come under pressure overnight," says Alastair Munro at Marex Spectron. "Meanwhile, profit growth at China industrial firms has slowed to a five-month low according to the National Bureau of Statistics." (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0803 ET - The U.S. dollar rises versus most major currencies on Thursday after Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate increase. But its increase against the Canadian dollar comes also comes after U.S. President Donald Trump rejected on Wednesday a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, threatening to punish Canada by taxing the cars it exports into the U.S. USD/CAD rises 0.4% to a nine-day high of 1.3070. ING says USD/CAD may rise to 1.35/36 on the back of the fact that NAFTA negotiations between the U.S. and Canada are in a limbo. "The prospects of azombie NAFTA may keep Canadian dollar under some pressure for now." (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

0750 ET - US stocks rise modestly as investors weigh the Fed's decision Wednesday to hike short-term rates for the third time this year. The Fed also signaled one more increase before the end of the year and more hikes next year, if warranted. We get the latest reading on economic growth this morning with the final estimate of 2Q GDP. Trade tensions also on investors' minds after President Trump, in a press conference Wednesday, accused China of trying to interfere in the midterm elections. The US and China have been locked in a trade spat. Trump also took aim at Canada, saying he was "very unhappy" with trade negotiations.

0658 ET - The fear that emerging market countries are lagging behind the U.S. in tightening monetary policies is slowly abating as Turkish and other emerging market central banks are raising interest rates. The discrepancies between the U.S. Federal Reserve and rest of the world have likely shrunk further on Thursday, given that central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines have again increased rates. Central banks are responding "with higher policy rates in a bid to restore calm in their currencies," says Societe Generale. The Indonesian bank has increased the seven-day repo rate by another 25 basis points to 5.75% "in its quest to stop USD/IDR from breaking above 15.00." In the Philippines, rates have increased by 50 bps to 4.5%. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

0957GMT-German inflation probably rose above 2% in September led by energy prices, says Jan Kozak, an economist at Morgan Stanley, following the publication of data from some German states. The country's annual inflation rate--measured by harmonized EU standards-probably rose to 2.1% in September from 1.9% in August, according to Mr. Kozak. "Incorporating the German releases up to this point, as well as our forecasts of the other major eurozone members, the weighted country average points to moderate upside risks to our euro area-wide inflation forecast of 2.1%," he says.

0549 ET - Italy's borrowing costs drop at an auction of government bonds compared with a month ago, despite Thursday's rise in Italian bond yields. The fall in the allotment yields at an auction of five- and 10-year BTPs and seven-year floating rate notes follows a drop in Italian bond yields in September as optimism built that Italy's government would present a 2019 budget plan that conformed to European Union fiscal rules. The allotment yield on the October 2023 BTP fell to 2.03% from 2.44% a month ago, while the allotment yield on the December 2028 BTP dropped to 2.90% from 3.25%. On the secondary market, Italian bond yields rise on reports of Italian politicians calling for a higher budget deficit to enable greater spending. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0504 ET - The euro's 0.2% fall against the dollar to 1.1712 is mainly due to a stronger dollar after a U.S. rate increase, but it's also because the coalition in Italy is reported to have been calling for a 2019 deficit closer to 2.5% of gross domestic product. "Italy may miss today's budget deadline," says Societe Generale. "It now seems there will be a sting in the tail and this has short circuited this month's advance in euro crosses" and steepening of eurozone government bond yield curves, SocGen says. European Commission's economy chief Pierre Moscovici called for the deficit to be well below 2%, and Italy's financial minister Giovanni Tria previously insisted that the shortfall would be around 1.6%. The euro falls to a one-week low against the yen of 131.57.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

 HDFed Increases Interest Rates, Signals One More Bump in '18   BYBy Nick Timiraos    WC893 words   PD27 September 2018   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA1   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPThe Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates by another quarter-percentage point, and central-bank officials signaled they expected to lift them again later this year and through 2019 to keep a strong economy on an even keel.

The policy makers voted unanimously Wednesday to lift their benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%. Most Fed officials expected to raise rates one more time this year, according to new projections released after the conclusion of their two-day rate-setting meeting.
   TDThe increase, which drew a rebuke from President Trump, is the third this year and the eighth since the Fed began to lift rates in late 2015 after keeping them pinned close to zero after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed's action marks the first time it has lifted its benchmark rate above 2% since 2008.

It also is the first time in a decade the fed-funds rate will rise above inflation, measured by the Fed's preferred gauge, which excludes volatile energy and food categories. So-called core prices rose 2% in July.

"These rates remain low," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference. "This gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans."

Mr. Trump, at a news conference later Wednesday, said he was "not happy" about the Fed raising rates. But he said, "They are raising them because we are doing so well." And he said higher rates weren't all bad because they could help people who rely on interest savings for income.

Mr. Powell said the central bank decision was guided by economic theory and evidence -- not politics: "That's who we are. That's what we do. And that's just the way it's always going to be for us," he said.

Stocks erased gains and closed lower Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 3.059% from 3.102%. Yields fall as bond prices rise, and Treasury yields are near their highest levels in seven years.

The Fed's actions ripple through the economy over time by raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Rising mortgage rates appear to have contributed to a somewhat slower pace of home sales this year.

Even if the Fed raises its benchmark rate to 3% next year, "we don't think that's a hindrance to the economy," said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank in Columbus, Ohio. "We don't see that lifting mortgage rates substantially. We don't see that as a threat to credit line borrowing."

The big question now is how much higher officials think they need to raise rates to keep the economy from overheating. The Fed targets a 2% inflation rate, which it sees as a sign of healthy demand. It wants to avoid economic growth that becomes unsustainable, leading to a boom and then bust.

Projections released after Wednesday's meeting show that most Fed officials expect they will raise rates by 1 percentage point through next year, and most officials penciled in at least one more quarter-point increase for 2020.

That would leave the benchmark rate slightly higher than 3.25%. Because this is modestly above the so-called neutral rate most officials project is required to balance supply and demand over the long run, such a setting would deliberately restrict growth.

Mr. Powell has stressed the uncertainty of estimating this neutral setting. To that end, the Fed dropped from its postmeeting statement on Wednesday a sentence that for years had described its rate stance as "accommodative," meaning officials were pressing on the gas pedal to spur more growth.

Economic projections released after the meeting envision an unusually favorable set of conditions in which the unemployment rate holds below 4% over the next three years but inflation never rises far beyond the Fed's 2% target.

Whether the Fed realizes this "Goldilocks" economy that is neither too hot nor too cold could depend on whether inflation behaves as expected.

The risk that inflation climbs higher and faster than anticipated could require the Fed to raise rates "a little bit quicker," Mr. Powell said. He quickly added, "We don't see that. We really don't see that."

Wednesday's interest-rate projections show two different schools of thought about how the Fed might proceed.

One camp of officials said so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level they project is consistent with low and stable inflation, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion.

Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials have said if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth.

The Fed's projection that the economy could stay in a sweet spot for years also depends on forces outside of its control, including trade policy.

 HDTEXT-Indonesia c.bank raises rates a 5th time since mid-May   WC1,528 words   PD27 September 2018   ET12:27   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPJAKARTA, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank lifted its benchmark interest rate for the fifth time since mid-May on Thursday, hours after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in the United States.

Here is the official translation of Bank Indonesia's statement. The original was in Indonesian:
   TDThe BI Board of Governors agreed on 26th and 27th September 2018 to raise the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate by 25 bps to 5.75 percent, while also raising the Deposit Facility (DF) and Lending Facility (LF) rates by 25 bps to 5.00 percent and 6.50 percent respectively.

The decision is consistent with ongoing efforts to lower the current account deficit within a manageable threshold while maintaining the attractiveness of the domestic financial markets, thus further strengthens Indonesia's external resilience despite widespread global uncertainty.

The Government's seriousness and concrete measures, with Bank Indonesia, to stimulate exports and reduce imports is expected to lower the current account deficit, specifically in 2019, to around 2.5 percent of GDP.

Furthermore, Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen coordination with the Government and other relevant authorities to maintain economic stability and bolster external resilience.

Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will monitor prevailing economic developments, such as the current account deficit, exchange rates, financial system stability and inflation, as follow-up measures to maintain macroeconomic and financial system stability.

To strengthen the Rupiah stability, the policy rate hike is also supported by policies to implement Domestic Non-Deliverable Forwards (DNDF) transactions in order to accelerate forex market deepening while providing alternate hedging instrument for banks and corporations.

DNDF transaction is a forward transaction with netting settlement in the domestic forex market, using Rupiah.

The reference rates are JISDOR for USD against IDR and Bank Indonesia FX Transaction Midrate for for non-USD against IDR.

DNDF transactions can be done by banks with customers and foreign parties to hedge foreign exchange risks, and must be supported by an underlying transaction in the form of trade in goods and services, investment, and bank loans in foreign currency.

Global economic growth becomes further uneven, accompanied by persistent global financial market uncertainty.

The U.S. economy has maintained pace on the back of faster consumption and investment growth, combined with rising inflation. In line with expectations, The Fed raised the FFR policy rate by 25bps as part of its monetary policy normalization.

Meanwhile, economic growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs) and Europe is estimated to be weaker-than-expected.

Economic moderation is even expected for Japan and China.

The uneven global economic growth is unseparable from the trade tensions between the US and several countries.

High uncertainty in the global financial markets also prompts investors to place their fund in safe assets, especially in the U.S.

The various headwinds have triggered broad U.S. dollar appreciation and capital outflows from emerging markets, culminating in depreciatory pressures on currencies in developing countries.

National economic growth in Indonesia remains in line with the previous projection, backed by domestic demand.

Strong consumption data is supported by improving incomes and spending on the elections.

Solid investment growth is expected to persist, bolstered by building investment in relation to infrastructure projects and property as well as non-building investment.

Nevertheless, stronger export growth is expected to be restrained by weak agricultural exports despite improving manufacturing exports, boosted by the chemicals industry as well as iron and steel subsector.

On the other hand, imports remain high on strong domestic demand, especially of capital goods as a corollary of increasing investment.

Consequently, Bank Indonesia projects national economic growth in 2018 at 5.0-5.4 percent, increasing thereafter to 5.1-5.5 percent in 2019.

Indonesia's trade balance recorded a deficit in August 2018. The trade deficit stood at $1.02 billion in the reporting period, halving from $2.01 billion the month earlier.

The trade deficit stemmed from a growth surge of oil and gas imports, particularly crude oil.

Meanwhile, the non-oil and gas trade balance recorded a surplus in line with fewer non-oil and gas imports, including machinery and mechanical appliances, iron and steel, vehicles and components, organic chemicals, as well as plastics and articles of plastic.

Nevertheless, demand for non-oil and gas import remain high, as domestic demand remain high.

Cumulatively from January-August 2018, therefore, Indonesia's trade balance recorded a $4.09 billion deficit.

Consequently, the position of reserve assets stood at $117.9 billion at the end of August 2018, equivalent to 6.8 months of imports or 6.6 months of imports and servicing government external debt, which is well above the international standard of three months.

The Rupiah has continued to lean against depreciatory pressures, while mitigating volatility.

Rupiah depreciation is in line with the currencies of peer countries, spurred by broad US dollar appreciation.

Therefore, the Rupiah depreciated by an average of 1.05 percent in August 2018 but defied pressures in September to close at a level of 14,905/USD on 26th September 2018.

Year-to-date (ytd), therefore, the Rupiah has lost 8.97 percent in value against the U.S. dollar as of 26th September 2018, faring better, however, than the Indian rupee, South African rand, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.

Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will continue to implement exchange rate stabilisation measures in line with the currency's fundamental value, while maintaining market mechanisms and financial market deepening efforts.

Such policy is aimed to contain Rupiah volatility and liquidity adequacy in the market, to prevent risks on macroeconomic stability and financial system.

Low and stable inflation has been maintained. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded 0.05 percent (mtm) deflation in August 2018, after posting 0.28 percent (mtm) inflation the month earlier.

Deflation of volatile foods (VF) and administered prices (AP) was the main contributor to headline deflation in August, while the pace of core inflation slowed.

Consequently, inflation recorded an annual rate of 3.20 percent (yoy), which is relatively stable compared with the 3.18 percent (yoy) recorded last month.

Price pressures on volatile foods (VF) recorded deflation in the reporting period due primarily to corrections affecting several foodstuffs.

Administered prices (AP) also experienced deflation because of corrections to airfares.

Core inflation was controlled at 0.30 percent (mtm), falling from 0.41 percent (mtm) the month earlier. Controlled core inflation is linked to policy consistency by Bank Indonesia in terms of anchoring rational inflation expectations to the target corridor, including maintaining Rupiah exchange rates in line with the currency's fundamental value.

Looking ahead, Bank Indonesia projects inflation within the target range of 3.5±1 percent in 2018.

Furthermore, Bank Indonesia and the Government will constantly strengthen policy coordination to control low and stable inflation.

Financial system stability has been maintained as the bank intermediation function improves and the banking industry effectively contained credit risk.

Maintained financial system stability is reflected in the high Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) reported by the banking industry at 22.5 percent and the liquidity ratio of 19.8 percent in July 2018.

In addition, the banking sector maintained a low level of non-performing loans (NPL) at 2.7 percent (gross) or 1.3 percent (net).

Financial system stability is also contributing to improvements in the bank intermediation function. Credit growth was reported to accelerate from 10.8 percent (yoy) to 11.3 percent (yoy) in July 2018, while deposit growth was maintained at 6.9 percent (yoy) in the reporting period compared with 7.0 percent (yoy) the month earlier.

On the other hand, nonbank economic financing through the financial markets, such as initial public offerings (IPO) and rights issues, corporate bonds, medium-term notes (MTN) and Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCD), reached a cumulative total of 133.2 trillion rupiah (gross) as of July 2018, which is below the 163.9 trillion rupiah recorded in the same period last year.

Consequently, Bank Indonesia projects credit growth in 2018 at 10.0-12.0 percent (yoy), accelerating from the 8.2 percent (yoy) realised in 2017.

Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia still predicts deposit growth to slow down from 2017 achievement of 9.4 percent (yoy), yet remain within the 8.0-10.0 percent (yoy) range.

Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will continue to monitor and maintain sufficient liquidity to support financial system stability.

Positive domestic economic developments are backed by a secure, efficient, available and reliable payment system and Rupiah currency management.

In August 2018, the financial system operated smoothly.

Furthermore, the settlement of noncash transactions as well as cash transactions increased in the reporting period as economic activity accelerated.

Such dynamics were confirmed by a 9.48 percent (yoy) bump in National Clearing System (SKNBI) transactions and a 13.6 percent (yoy) increase of noncash retail payment system transactions (ATM/debit cards, credit cards and e-money).

Regarding cash payments (Rupiah currency management), the position of currency in circulation surged 10.2 percent (yoy) as in line with public transaction needs and cyclical pattern. (Reporting by Gayatri Suroyo)

   LP1058 GMT - The fear that emerging market countries are lagging behind the U.S. in tightening monetary policies is slowly abating as Turkish and other emerging market central banks are raising interest rates. The discrepancies between the U.S. Federal Reserve and rest of the world have likely shrunk further on Thursday, given that central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines have again increased rates. Central banks are responding "with higher policy rates in a bid to restore calm in their currencies," says Societe Generale. The Indonesian bank has increased the seven-day repo rate by another 25 basis points to 5.75% "in its quest to stop USD/IDR from breaking above 15.00." In the Philippines, rates have increased by 50 bps to 4.5%. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)
   TD1049 GMT - UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo have solid capital positions but nonperforming loans are still a burden for the lenders, ING says. Italy's largest banks "continue to be burdened by their large nonperforming-loans exposure despite measures taken to shore up the positions," it says. However, "new NPL generation has slowed down" and the banks' capital position is solid, it says. The banks' stocks trade 2.9% lower as concerns about the country's budget take a toll on the Italian market. (pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com; @pietrolombard10)

The Philippines and Indonesia boosted rates again this afternoon--no surprise--but their increasingly hawkish commentary reflects an urgency have both issue cool. The Philippines economy slowed sharply in 2Q while the unexpected jump in Indonesia last quarter isn't expected to last. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)

0853 GMT - Papua New Guinea has started marketing its debut dollar-denominated bond, which will be a good test of investor appetite toward emerging-market debt. The 10-year junk-rated bonds were launched with a yield of around 9% and the deal may raise up to $500 million. That's a critical size--one which will allow the offering to be part of a key bond index. The offering follows extensive meetings with fixed-income investors across the globe early this month. The bonds will be priced in early New York hours, according to a term sheet seen by WSJ. (manju.dalal@wsj.com; @manjudalalsg)

0850 GMT - Today's rate hike by Bank Indonesia may be its last one of 2018 as the central bank juggles maintaining financial stability and sustaining healthy economic growth, says Bahana Sekuritas. Even before today's move, the firm saw "BI as already way ahead of the curve. And it is indeed fair to question the necessity of the latest rate hike, which was taken amid [a] stabilizing--even declining--trend" downward for the dollar in recent days. (i-made.sentana@wsj.com)

0836 GMT - Bank Indonesia will introduce domestic non-deliverable forward rupiah trading--a likely attempt to encourage its companies to better protect themselves against currency swings. Many Indonesian firms, like the property developers, make most of their money domestically but have borrowed in dollars, which become harder to repay when the rupiah weakens. "One of the main benefits of companies hedging more would be to make the market less sensitive to fluctuations in the currency," says Duncan Tan, FX and rates strategist at DBS in Singapore. "It will help with market confidence and sentiment, but wouldn't have at tangible impact on stabilizing the rupiah immediately." The rupiah recently hit 20-year lows versus the dollar. (saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com; @saumvaish)

0825 GMT - Bank Indonesia's interest-rate rise today--the fifth such move this year--shows the central bank's main focus is supporting the currency, Capital Economics says. It says the rupiah is down by nearly 9% against the U.S. dollar this year, and in recent days has been touching all-time lows reached during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Capital Economics says authorities are worried about currency weakness due to a high level of foreign-currency debt. "Indonesia's current account deficit, which hit a four-year high in the second quarter, and the high proportion of government debt held by foreigners mean the rupiah typically gets hit harder than other Asian currencies during periods of weak risk appetite," it says, adding that more rate rises before the end of the year are possible.

0821 GMT - Count Maybank among those anticipating a sideways Singapore dollar ahead of the central bank's October policy statement. Local inflation is rising, and policymakers are tightening globally. A section of the market believes the MAS will tighten further next month. The greenback has ticked up in general this afternoon in Asia with the euro's decline, but versus the Singapore dollar it's back to S$1.3650 after briefly topping S$1.3670 this afternoon.

0809 GMT - Amid the concerns in India's shadow-banking sector, illustrated by the default at IL&FS and stock-market struggles, the future for nonbank finance companies will include weaker future earnings and stock-price adjustments, says economist and strategist Ashutosh Datar on the Smartkarma platform. "This is typical of what happens in every rate-tightening cycle in India, and this time also will be no different. There is unlikely to be a full-blown crisis." But he adds, "Given the pace at which the NBFCs are growing, the risks are getting bigger. It is time for [India's] regulator to think how much of the credit can remain outside the banking system, and thus subject to lesser prudential regulations."

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China, Taiwan and New Zealand sat tight after the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike, but Indonesia and the Philippines pulled the trigger on Thursday to prop up their battered currencies and temper risks to inflation and financial stability.

In a statement that marked the end of the era of "accommodative" policy, Fed policymakers lifted rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 2.00-2.25 percent. The U.S. central bank foresees another hike in December, three more next year, and one in 2020.

The Fed outlook is pressuring Asian currencies across the board, but not all countries need to tweak their policy. New Zealand is comfortable with a weaker kiwi as it helps its exporters. In China, a weaker yuan does raise concerns about capital outflows, but its currency is tightly managed and it also has capital control tools to mitigate financial risks.

For countries that run widening trade deficits, however, weaker currencies are posing risks to inflation, growth and financial stability.

"Economies such as India and Indonesia are more exposed to outflows ... We will continue to see further depreciation in 2018 and throughout 2019, although perhaps at a slower pace," said Carlos Casanova, APAC economist at Coface, who expects more hikes in the two countries and Philippines.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) hiked rates by 50 bps to 4.50 percent to curb inflation and shore up the fragile peso, adding to the three hikes worth 100 bps since May.

In August, inflation surged to a more than nine-year high of 6.4 percent, above the central bank's 2-4 percent comfort range.

Bank Indonesia added 25 bps to its four previous hikes this year, bringing rates to 5.75 percent as expected, or 150 bps higher since May.

The peso is trading around its lowest in 12 years, having shed some 8 percent against the dollar year-to-date, while the rupiah is around a two-decade low after a 9 percent plunge.

Asia's worst performing currency, the rupee, which has weakened by more than 12 percent to record lows, is also likely to be a key consideration for Reserve Bank of India, which is expected to hike by 25 bps next week.

All three currencies ended steady on Thursday.

One potential silver lining for the Asian deficit trio may be that the Fed is underestimating the impact of its past and future hikes as well as other factors such as the trade war on the global economy, and implicitly, the recoil back home, some analysts say.

Against a backdrop of slower-than-expected Fed tightening, ING Asia economist Prakash Sakpal sees 75 bps worth of hikes in Indonesia, 125 bps in Philippines and 100 bps in India by end-2019, including Thursday's increases.

"This (Fed) tightening will likely prove too much for the rest of the world," said Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International.

"The Fed will have to strike a more cautious tone."

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority moved in lockstep with the Fed as its currency is pegged to the greenback.

GRAVITY PULL

For the stronger Asian economies, which are increasingly gravitating towards China on trade and investment, and away from the United States, the Fed outlook does not move the needle as much as it did during its previous tightening cycles.

South Korea's central bank Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, as well as weakness in inflation and the job market weighed against policy tightening.

Taiwan left rates unchanged at 1.375 percent, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept them at 1.75 percent, where they have been for the past two years, citing tepid inflation and the risk of a trade war.

Like most economies in Asia, New Zealand is now much more closely integrated with China than with the United States.

Worries that China's economy is slowing and will further suffer from an intensifying trade row with Washington are therefore more relevant for most Asian economies' interest rate outlook than the strength of the U.S. economy.

New Zealand now trades about twice as much with China than it does with the United States, a consequence of Beijing's staggering growth over the last two decades.

When Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, triggering the global financial crisis, New Zealand traded with the United States 1.35 times more than with China.

"China’s economic outlook matters more than the U.S.," said Mark Wills, who develops multi-asset strategies for institutional clients at State Street Global Advisors.

ASIAN EMs STRONGER

China's central bank skipped open market operations on Thursday, meaning it did not immediately adjust borrowing costs for interbank loans after the Fed hike. The People's Bank of China stood pat in June, but raised rates slightly in March shortly after Fed's move.

Despite the trade risks and slowing consumption, China is still seen growing at an impressive rate of around 6.5 percent this year. For Asian emerging markets, this is an advantage that they have over peers in Latin America and elsewhere.

That, coupled with less worrying current account deficits and stronger economic prospects, is likely to help Asia avoid the kind of tumult that has seen Argentina hike rates to 60 percent and Turkey to 24 percent this year.

"Asian central banks have been vigilant, and pre-emptive ... in running their monetary policies," said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corporation.

"They gain credibility in this cycle."

 SEEconomy   HDTimiraos's Take: The ‘Dot Plot' Reveals Two Policy Directions; A split in Fed officials' forecasts likely reflects different opinions over how inflation is likely to behave   BYBy Nick Timiraos    WC458 words   PD27 September 2018   ET11:30   SNWSJ Pro Central Banking   SCRSTPROCB   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPIt's generally a mistake to obsess over the interest-rate projections—the so-called dot plot—in the out-years of the Federal Reserve's quarterly economic projections. Nevertheless, the projections released Wednesday highlight two different directions policy could move after next year.

Most Fed officials see the central bank raising rates by another percentage point through next year. The question then turns on what happens after that, when rates will be well within the range officials currently estimate is likely to prevail over the long run.
   TDLooking ahead to 2020, the median projection shows just one more rate increase, to a range between 3.25% and 3.5%.

Look closer, and there are only two officials who project such a level of interest rates. Rather, there's a cluster of seven officials who expect the Fed will need to raise rates above 3.5% and another cluster that says rates shouldn't need to rise beyond 3.25%.

The split likely reflects different opinions over how inflation is likely to behave. Wednesday's projections show all officials see inflation holding between 2% and 2.3% over the next three years. The dot plot shows, however, that officials expect a different rate will be needed to keep inflation at that range.

The strength of the Phillips curve could largely determine which of the two camps prevails. The first camp says so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level they project is consistent with low and stable inflation, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion.

Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials say if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth, even if unemployment remains at very low levels.

Mr. Powell didn't say where he stood on Wednesday, but he continued to voice some uncertainty over the traditional models that have animated the Fed's thinking. "Let's just admit that the inflation process has changed, dramatically, from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It's in a good place now," he said.

Officials will be "watching carefully," he said. "If inflation reacts more strongly, or more weakly, to the strong economy, then we'll adjust policy appropriately."

   LP0904 GMT - The euro's 0.2% fall against the dollar to 1.1712 is mainly due to a stronger dollar after a U.S. rate increase, but it's also because the coalition in Italy is reported to have been calling for a 2019 deficit closer to 2.5% of gross domestic product. "Italy may miss today's budget deadline," says Societe Generale. "It now seems there will be a sting in the tail and this has short circuited this month's advance in euro crosses" and steepening of eurozone government bond yield curves, SocGen says. European Commission's economy chief Pierre Moscovici called for the deficit to be well below 2%, and Italy's financial minister Giovanni Tria previously insisted that the shortfall would be around 1.6%. The euro falls to a one-week low against the yen of 131.57.(olga.cotaga@wsj.com)
   TD0856 GMT - Economic growth may become a victim of central banks' efforts to stem inflation and currency fires with interest-rate hikes. The Philippines and Indonesia boosted rates again this afternoon--no surprise--but their increasingly hawkish commentary reflects an urgency have both issue cool. The Philippines economy slowed sharply in 2Q while the unexpected jump in Indonesia last quarter isn't expected to last. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)

0853 GMT - Papua New Guinea has started marketing its debut dollar-denominated bond, which will be a good test of investor appetite toward emerging-market debt. The 10-year junk-rated bonds were launched with a yield of around 9% and the deal may raise up to $500 million. That's a critical size--one which will allow the offering to be part of a key bond index. The offering follows extensive meetings with fixed-income investors across the globe early this month. The bonds will be priced in early New York hours, according to a term sheet seen by WSJ. (manju.dalal@wsj.com; @manjudalalsg)

0850 GMT - Today's rate hike by Bank Indonesia may be its last one of 2018 as the central bank juggles maintaining financial stability and sustaining healthy economic growth, says Bahana Sekuritas. Even before today's move, the firm saw "BI as already way ahead of the curve. And it is indeed fair to question the necessity of the latest rate hike, which was taken amid [a] stabilizing--even declining--trend" downward for the dollar in recent days. (i-made.sentana@wsj.com)

0836 GMT - Bank Indonesia will introduce domestic non-deliverable forward rupiah trading--a likely attempt to encourage its companies to better protect themselves against currency swings. Many Indonesian firms, like the property developers, make most of their money domestically but have borrowed in dollars, which become harder to repay when the rupiah weakens. "One of the main benefits of companies hedging more would be to make the market less sensitive to fluctuations in the currency," says Duncan Tan, FX and rates strategist at DBS in Singapore. "It will help with market confidence and sentiment, but wouldn't have at tangible impact on stabilizing the rupiah immediately." The rupiah recently hit 20-year lows versus the dollar. (saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com; @saumvaish)

0825 GMT - Bank Indonesia's interest-rate rise today--the fifth such move this year--shows the central bank's main focus is supporting the currency, Capital Economics says. It says the rupiah is down by nearly 9% against the U.S. dollar this year, and in recent days has been touching all-time lows reached during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Capital Economics says authorities are worried about currency weakness due to a high level of foreign-currency debt. "Indonesia's current account deficit, which hit a four-year high in the second quarter, and the high proportion of government debt held by foreigners mean the rupiah typically gets hit harder than other Asian currencies during periods of weak risk appetite," it says, adding that more rate rises before the end of the year are possible.

0821 GMT - Count Maybank among those anticipating a sideways Singapore dollar ahead of the central bank's October policy statement. Local inflation is rising, and policymakers are tightening globally. A section of the market believes the MAS will tighten further next month.

0809 GMT - Amid the concerns in India's shadow-banking sector, illustrated by the default at IL&FS and stock-market struggles, the future for nonbank finance companies will include weaker future earnings and stock-price adjustments, says economist and strategist Ashutosh Datar on the Smartkarma platform. "This is typical of what happens in every rate-tightening cycle in India, and this time also will be no different. There is unlikely to be a full-blown crisis." But he adds, "Given the pace at which the NBFCs are growing, the risks are getting bigger. It is time for [India's] regulator to think how much of the credit can remain outside the banking system, and thus subject to lesser prudential regulations."

0807 GMT - Italian government bond yields trade sharply higher amid conflicting headlines about next year's budget which is due for presentation on Thursday. While sources indicated that finance minister Giovanni Tria was willing to accept a budget deficit of 1.9% of GDP, reports from late Wednesday said that the ruling coalition wanted the goal set at 2.4% and that the announcement could be delayed, say Rabobank's analysts. The 10-year BTP yield is trading 14 basis points higher at 2.98%, according to Tradeweb. This increase in yields doesn't bode well for Italy's upcoming auction of five- and 10-year BTPs on Thursday. Bond yields move inversely to prices. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0733 GMT - The possibility of oil prices continuing to climb near-term as major producers over the weekend put off a decision on further output increases is increasing macro-related risks in India, says Kotak Securities, possibly leading to more pressure on bond yields and the rupee. It adds that weak global sentiment may curtail foreign flows to India, leading to a large balance-of-payment deficit. Kotak says the equities market only partly reflects all this as stocks remain richly valued in the broker's view. If oil jumps further, the firm says technology and commodity stocks offer better reward-risk. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)

0728 GMT - The dollar rises against the euro, with EUR/USD falling to a one-week low of 1.1686 a day after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 2% to 2.25% and said the U.S. economy is in a particularly bright spot. The Fed "can continue its gradual rate hike cycle as planned and doesn't have to suddenly speed up as there is no inflation to fight nor slow down as the real economy continues to develop well," says Commerzbank. However, there is "a moderate permanent negative factor" facing USD: uncertainty stemming from President Trump's decisions. "Who would want to exclude anything with this president?" Commerzbank asks. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

0700 GMT - While some analysts think further monetary easing by China is imminent, Standard Chartered economist Ding Shuang says a 4th cut to banks' reserve-requirement ratios this year would be premature. "The [yuan] is still under a lot of depreciation pressure, so I don't think the timing is right. An RRR cut would give a signal of significant loosening," generally a negative for a currency's value. He believes it's more likely the PBoC will inject further liquidity into the financial market through shorter-term instruments like the medium-term lending facility. Meanwhile, he thinks authorities will further seek to stimulate economic growth through fiscal measures. (chao.deng@wsj.com)

 HDUPDATE 2-China leaves rates steady after Fed as two economies diverge   WC748 words   PD27 September 2018   ET08:04   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LP(Adds PBOC adviser comment)

SHANGHAI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China's central bank left short-term rates unchanged on Thursday, choosing not to follow a benchmark interest rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve despite the risk that it could that it could put renewed pressure on the yuan.
   TDThe move by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) means that it did not immediately adjust borrowing costs for interbank loans after the Fed raised its key rate overnight.

While the PBOC had been expected to stand pat and has not always followed the Fed in lockstep, the decision highlights diverging policy paths for the world's largest economies.

China's economy is slowly losing momentum and is facing more pressure from escalating U.S. trade tariffs.

The Fed, on the other hand, sees the U.S. economy growing at faster-than-expected pace this year, with only a slight slowdown in 2019.

China has, in fact, been easing credit policies and trying to reduce financing costs in various ways in recent months as economic activity has softened and U.S. trade threats mount.

The PBOC also said it had skipped open market operations on Thursday as liquidity levels in the banking system were "relatively high".

It did not mention interest rates on reverse repos in a statement on the its website, but attributed "relatively high" liquidity levels to quarter-end fiscal expenditures, which could "absorb factors including maturing reverse repos and government bond issuance".

Sheng Songcheng, a policy adviser to the central bank, told state-run Beijing News that raising interest rates does not fit China's current economic situation, as it needs to lower financing costs to support companies and promote steady growth.

"The Fed rate hike would pile some pressure on the yuan in the short term, but it would not be huge as China's economy was largely stable," Sheng was quoted as saying.

China has currency and capital flow controls in place, and there remains a gap in interest rates between the China and United States, Sheng added.

The PBOC had followed a Fed hike in March by bumping up its short- and medium-term rates, but held its fire in June despite U.S. tightening.

MIND THE GAP?

The interest rate on China's benchmark bond is about 61 basis points (bps) higher than its U.S. counterpart . In June, the gap was more than 70 bps, and any further narrowing could risk a resurgence of outflows from China.

The Fed foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020.

In contrast, analysts forecast more policy support measures are on the way in China in coming months, including at least one more reduction in banks' reserve requirements, other forms of liquidity injections and bigger tax cuts.

"There is no regular monetary policy meeting in China, and hence it can adjust rates any time. Skipping OMO today per se does not have an implication on future rates move," said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac.

"That said, this time round, there is minimal pressure for the PBOC to hike OMO rates given the narrow spreads with market rates."

The interest rate for seven-day reverse repurchase agreements stood at 2.55 percent in the last cash injection on Sept.20, while market rates largely swung in a range of 2.55 to 2.7 percent in recent months.

Reverse repos are one of its most commonly used tools to control liquidity in the financial system.

The PBOC has not changed benchmark one-year lending or deposit rate since October 2015.

With 60 billion yuan ($8.73 billion) worth of reverse repos maturing on Thursday, the PBOC drained the same amount of funds from the money market for the day.

The yuan was little changed after the Fed and PBOC decision.

Chinese authorities took several steps last month to stabilise the currency after largely standing aside and letting it fall for 10 straight weeks over the summer.

But analysts expect it will come under renewed pressure in coming months if the U.S. dollar remains buoyant and as U.S. tariffs start to bite on China's exporters, prompting Beijing to roll out more easing measures.

 HDStocks Drop After  Interest-Rate  Increase -- WSJ   BYBy Amrith Ramkumar and Donato Paolo Mancini    WC711 words   PD27 September 2018   ET08:32   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   PGB12   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPThis article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (September 27, 2018).

U.S. stocks erased gains and closed lower Wednesday, hurt by drops in financials and materials stocks after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and signaled a continued gradual path of increases.
   TDThe late-session slip came as Treasury yields fell following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference. Some analysts said the move in the bond market stoked worries about a flattening yield curve. That is historically a negative indicator for longer-term growth prospects that hurts financial stocks because higher yields tend to boost lending profitability.

Wednesday's projections showed most Fed officials expect to raise rates one more time this year and three times next year, a pace in line with the expectations of many investors.

While bank stocks fell, materials shares extended their week-to-date declines. Discussions between the U.S. and its trading partners are continuing, adding to anxiety about a growth-hindering tariff fight.

After the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hit fresh records last week, some analysts have said they are re-evaluating trade risks, which could challenge markets at the same time interest rates continue to rise.

"I do feel like markets are largely shrugging them off because there's no way to know what the actual outcome will be," said Peter Lazaroff, co-chief Investment Officer at Plancorp. "If they escalate, it would be negative for sentiment."

The S&P 500 fell 9.59 points, or 0.3%, in a fourth straight session of losses, though it remains near last week's all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 106.93 points, or 0.4%, to 26385.28. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 17.11 points, or 0.2%, to 7990.37.

On Wednesday, Canada publicly declared that any changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement have to incorporate limits on the U.S. use of tariffs on national-security grounds. The move came after the Trump administration's top trade negotiator threatened to move forward with a bilateral accord with Mexico amid a lack of progress with Canada on renegotiating NAFTA.

Analysts are also tracking the relationship between the U.S. and China, which canceled trade talks scheduled for this week as a monthslong tariff spat continues.

Worries about a global economic slowdown have hurt commodities this year, and the S&P 500 materials and energy sectors both dropped 1%. Oil prices edged lower after Brent crude, the global benchmark for prices, closed on Tuesday at its highest level since November 2014.

Meanwhile, the drop in Treasury yields sent the financial sector down 1.3%. Some analysts said Wednesday's Fed decision was largely in line with expectations but that officials largely sticking with previous projections was a less aggressive stance than some investors had anticipated.

"It signals to investors they think the economy is doing great, but not so great that they're worried about it," Mr. Lazaroff said.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 3.059% from 3.102%. Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, have approached seven-year highs lately.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, fell less than 0.1%.

Among individual stocks, Nike fell $1.09, or 1.3%, to $83.70 after the sportswear maker said its expenses increased last quarter, though it still topped earnings targets.

Declines in those various sectors offset gains in the recently formed communications-services and health-care sectors. Netflix was among the market's best performers Wednesday, adding 8.45, or 2.3%, to 377.88.

Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.3% to its highest level of the month.

Corrections & Amplifications Government bond prices edged slightly higher Wednesday. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that bond prices had fallen. (Sept. 26, 2018)

   TDA lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York could complicate the central bank's effort to control short-term interest rates at a time when investor scrutiny of those markets is intensifying.

TNB USA Inc. contends in a federal suit filed in late August that it has been wrongly blocked in its pursuit of a "master account" at the Fed that would allow it to earn interest on deposits placed on the Fed's books.

Analysts say that if TNB won approval to offer deposit accounts to clients and other banks copied its model, the development could pose a threat to how the Fed has controlled short-term rates since the 2008 crisis.

Instead of targeting a specific short-term rate, as it did before the financial meltdown, the Fed now sets a firm range between the rate it will pay deposit-taking banks at the high end, and the overnight reverse repurchase rate that is available to an approved roster of money managers and other institutions at the low end. The fed-funds rate floats in between.

TNB and other banks like it could thwart this system, analysts said, by collecting interest at the higher rate and offering that rate, minus a spread to cover costs and profits, to institutions that deposit money with them.

"I applaud the cleverness of this," said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. "That spread was sitting out there and somebody found a way to take advantage of that."

The Fed's range for the funds rate now stands at between 2.00% and 2.25%, with the interest on excess reserves rate at 2.20%, following the conclusion of its interest-rate setting meeting Wednesday.

TNB and banks like it would allow the sort of firms that would otherwise earn the lower reverse repo rate a way to get a higher return. That could render the rate floor moot. The Fed would still have a lot of control over short-term rates, but the lower end floor could cease to be a meaningful rate.

Some Fed watchers say the threat to the rate control regime may not prove that big a deal. For some time now, there has been little actual interest from eligible firms to earn the reverse repo rate, as those firms have put their money to work in other places, with better returns.

George Selgin, a Cato Institute senior fellow, attributes this situation in a blog post to "the tendency of the Fed's policy rate settings to lag further and further behind increases in market-determined interest rates" in a time of expanding budget deficits.

Regardless of market conditions, TNB says it isn't trying to break the system, and it is explained to the Fed how it will limit its activities to accomplish that. The Fed "has a clear statutory obligation" to grant the official account, said James McAndrews, a former Fed research official who is leading TNB. He also believes the TNB model is entirely complementary of the Fed's monetary policy goals and reinforces what's now in place.

The Fed hasn't said why it hasn't approved TNB's application beyond unspecified "policy concerns," TNB's lawsuit says. Central bank watchers say the denial is essentially without precedent. TNB is operating under a temporary charter that Connecticut banking regulators granted in August 2017 that expires next year.

The New York Fed has thus far not responded to the suit, and it and the Fed's Board of Governors declined to address the claims.

Peter Conti-Brown, a legal studies and business ethics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said he's "not convinced that the Fed has the legal authority to deny TNB its master account." The Fed "will have to show why it has the statutory authority to use discretion to deny" an application like TNB's, Mr. Conti-Brown said.

There are longer-term implications of the TNB model. If it proved popular -- and there is no way to know yet whether it would -- it could serve as the first step on a longer march to connect the public to the central bank more directly. Some academics have argued monetary policy could be made more potent if people and companies were allowed to bank directly with the Fed, via interest-bearing accounts.

Fed policy changes could then bypass fickle financial markets and make themselves felt at the consumer level, which would in theory make rate changes more powerful. TNB may not be seeking such an outcome, but a successful performance of its model could start the wheels turning for such a world.

TNB is "another manifestation of how innovation runs ahead of regulation, " said David Beckworth, of George Mason University's Mercatus Center. "The Fed's fear is not only destroying the floor system, but moving their balance sheet one step closer to more and more entities and ultimately the public."

By Swati Pandey and Vatsal Srivastava

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China and New Zealand sat tight after the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike, but both Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to tap the policy brakes later on Thursday to prop up their battered currencies and temper financial risks.

In a statement that marked the end of the era of "accommodative" policy, Fed policymakers lifted rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 2.00-2.25 percent. The U.S. central bank foresees another hike in December, three more next year, and one in 2020.

The Fed outlook is pressuring Asian currencies across the board, but not all countries need to tweak their policy. New Zealand is comfortable with a weaker kiwi as it helps its exporters. In China, a weaker yuan does raise concerns about capital outflows, but its currency is tightly managed and it also has capital control tools to mitigate financial risks.

For countries that run widening trade deficits, however, weaker currencies are posing risks to inflation, growth and financial stability.

"Policies in Philippines, Indonesia and India will remain in a tightening mode," said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is seen hiking rates by 50 bps to 4.50 percent later on Thursday to curb inflation and shore up the fragile peso, adding to the three hikes worth 100 bps since May.

In August, inflation surged to a more than nine-year high of 6.4 percent, above the central bank's 2-4 percent comfort range, prompting policymakers to say they will take "strong immediate action."

Around the same time as the BSP, Bank Indonesia is seen adding 25 bps to its four previous hikes this year, bringing rates to 5.75 percent, or 150 bps higher since May.

The peso is trading around its lowest in 12 years, having shed some 8 percent against the dollar year-to-date, while the rupiah is around a two-decade low after a 9 percent plunge.

Asia's worst performing currency, the rupee, which has weakened by more than 12 percent to record lows, is also likely to be a key consideration for Reserve Bank of India, which is expected to hike by 25 bps next week.

"This (Fed) tightening will likely prove too much for the rest of the world," said Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International.

"Emerging market economies, in particular, have already been facing tighter financial conditions this year, which have resurfaced some vulnerabilities as capital flows started reversing."

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority moved in lockstep with the Fed as its currency is pegged to the greenback.

GRAVITY PULL

For the stronger Asian economies, which are increasingly gravitating towards China on trade and investment, and away from the United States, the Fed outlook does not move the needle as much as it did during its previous tightening cycles.

South Korea's central bank Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, as well as weakness in inflation and the job market weighed against policy tightening. Later on Thursday, Taiwan is also widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 1.375 percent.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept rates at 1.75 percent, where they have been for the past two years, citing tepid inflation and the risk of a trade war.

Like most economies in Asia, New Zealand is now much more closely integrated with China than with the United States.

Worries that China's economy is slowing and will further suffer from an intensifying trade row with Washington are therefore more relevant for most Asian economies' interest rate outlook than the strength of the U.S. economy.

New Zealand now trades about twice as much with China than it does with the United States, a consequence of Beijing's staggering growth over the last two decades.

When Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, triggering the global financial crisis, New Zealand traded with the United States 1.35 times more than with China. Just before Beijing joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, that ratio was 4.25 times in Washington's favour.

"China’s economic outlook matters more than the U.S.," said Mark Wills, who develops multi-asset strategies for institutional clients at State Street Global Advisors.

ASIAN EMs STRONGER

China's central bank skipped open market operations on Thursday, meaning it did not immediately adjust borrowing costs for interbank loans after the Fed hike. The People's Bank of China stood pat in June, but raised rates slightly in March shortly after Fed's move.

Despite the trade risks and slowing consumption, China is still seen growing at an impressive rate of around 6.5 percent this year. For Asian emerging markets, this is an advantage that they have over peers in Latin America and elsewhere.

That, coupled with less worrying current account deficits and stronger economic prospects, is likely to help Asia avoid the kind of tumult that has seen Argentina hike rates to 60 percent and Turkey to 24 percent this year.

"Asian central banks have been vigilant, and pre-emptive ... in running their monetary policies," said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corporation.

"They gain credibility in this cycle."

 HDUS Fed Rate Rise Adding Pressure on Bank of Korea -- Market Talk   WC1,322 words   PD27 September 2018   ET06:00   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP0400 GMT - The Federal Reserve's Wednesday rate increase--the third for this year--and its signal to lift interest rates again later this year and through 2019 are adding pressure on the Bank of Korea to follow suit. BOK Gov. Lee Ju-yeol told reporters early Thursday that he will closely monitor widening US-Korean rate differentials and possible capital flight as a result, though he expects the Fed's latest rate increase to have limited impact on local markets for now. The Fed lifted the US benchmark federal-funds rate to a range of 2%-2.25% while the BOK policy rate has been held steady at 1.5% since November. Lee reaffirmed he would pare support for growth or tighten policy, but gave no clue to exactly when. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com ; @kwanwoo)
   TD0348 GMT - China's attempt to dial back its efforts to cut overcapacity and leverage its economy to cushion the fallout of trade tensions with the US may be impacting profit growth for foreign-owned companies, say economists. Profit growth for foreign-owned firms slowed to 7.6% on-year in August versus 10% at Chinese-owned private enterprises and 26.7% for state-owned enterprises. SOEs benefited from working on projects related to fiscal stimulus, such as railway infrastructure projects with anti-pollution work supporting local government entities that are classified as Chinese private enterprises, says ING's Iris Pang. Foreign-companies did not benefit from any meaningful increase in business, she added. (kenan.machado@wsj.com)

0335 GMT - Moody's foresees China's deleveraging campaign will see more 'testing times' ahead especially in the financial sector at a local level. It notes provinces such as Liaoning, Shanxi, Tianjin, Hunan and Yunnan with a high concentration of 'overcapacity industries or outdated industrial structures' are the most exposed to overall economic and financial stress. Meanwhile, "the financial, administration and ownership linkages between local banks, shadow banks and local government-owned enterprises from a complex network that could 'transmit and amplify' local financial distress and undermine regional economies," it adds. (chester.yung@wsj.com;@chester_yung)

0255 GMT - Citi sees Taiwan's central bank being rather "more cautious" on monetary policy in light of escalating global headwinds and as the island's inflation pressures are likely to moderate through year-end. "The fact that overnight rates have been kept at an extremely stable level...in recent months also suggests that [the central bank] has no intention to move its policy rate near term" as previous hikes had been signaled, the investment bank notes. The CBC meets today. (chester.yung@wsj.com; @chester_yung)

0244 GMT - The sharp rebound in oil prices the past few years hasn't been boosting the trade picture at crude exporter Malaysia, notes Nomura. That's because the Southeast Asian nation has become a larger net importer of petroleum products, leaving the overall oil trade balance in a small deficit since 2013. The investment bank adds that the lag in prices for LNG, which in general move with oil, suggests that any positive effects from that will likely only show up in 2019. That's also when Nomura expects slower global economic growth, perhaps curtailing demand for the fuel, which Malaysia also exports. (yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com; @yantoultra)

0239 GMT - [Dow Jones] The Federal Reserve's rising rates may put more downward pressure on emerging-market currencies, including the Malaysian ringgit. But the ringgit is largely dependent on sentiment, though the currency will remain relatively well supported, according to Kenanga Research. This would likely limit the downside on the ringgit, though Kenanga still expects it to remain weak against major currencies, especially the U.S dollar. It expects the ringgit to test the 4.15 per dollar level soon. The ringgit has weakened only 2.4% against the U.S dollar year-to-date, better than most of its peers. It is now 4.14 per dollar. Kenanga's year-end target is 4.05 per dollar. (yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com ; @yantoultra)

0146 GMT - Though no rate hike will happen Tuesday, Australia's central bank may provide some comment on financial-system stability, says Citi economist Paul Brennan. The RBA board is likely to be briefed by senior staff on the issue ahead of the Oct. 12 publication of the central bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Review. Brennan says this would provide an opportunity for the RBA to share its view on the increase in money-market funding spreads the last few months. If mortgage rates continue to rise, it will argue for the central bank to wait even longer before boosting its policy rate. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0137 GMT - Capital Economics has said that another 2018 interest-rate hike in India remains in the cards. The rupee's ongoing weakness will tip the balance firmly in favor a hike after next Friday's meeting, the firm predicts, with GDP growth strong and core inflation remaining elevated. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0126 GMT - China fixed the yuan at a fresh month-plus low, guiding it 0.1% weaker against the dollar today. The PBoC set the midpoint for the dollar's daily trading range at CNY6.8642, compared with CNY6.8571 yesterday. China has been restraining the pace of the yuan's decline in the fix, setting it stronger than prior-day onshore closing levels in recent days. On Wednesday, the pair finished at CNY6.8740.

0113 GMT - Hong Kong's property market may be starting to feel pressure from the city's prime lending rate being poised to go up for the first time in 12 years. A resale in a middle-class Island East estate was done after the asking price was slashed 15%, according to real-estate agent Centaline, after a 20% reduction in a unit of a Kowloon public-private co-op project. Still, Centaline doesn't expect a jump in the benchmark lending rate, even if the Fed hikes again in December, so incremental lending burdens on homeowners would be quite small. (john.wu@wsj.com)

0108 GMT - A severe drought gripping much of eastern Australia is unlikely to be eased by usual spring rains, the country's weather bureau says. The latest climate forecasts indicate conditions are likely to be drier and warmer than average over the coming months, meaning a low chance of recovery for drought-affected areas of eastern Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology says in its latest climate note. Weather conditions and sea temperatures over the Pacific and Indian Oceans, while currently neutral, point in modelling to a drought-worsening El Nino weather phenomenon forming in spring, the bureau says. One of the driest winters on record has seen crop forecasts lowered sharply, while some regional communities have dam levels at only 10% of capacity and may soon run out of water.

0106 GMT - New Zealand expects to raise an extra NZ$80 million ($53.3 million) annually with a new NZ$35 levy on foreign tourists. The government has been mulling such a tax as tourist numbers overwhelm infrastructure and the environment. The country has in recent years been a vacation hotspot for wealthy Americans. While critics say the levy may harm tourism, which last year bypassed dairy as New Zealand's biggest export, Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage says the money will help "improve the protection and enhancement of New Zealand's distinctive natural environment and improve tourism planning." Almost 4 million tourists visited New Zealand the past year; the country's population is 4.7 million. (rob.taylor@wsj.com; @WSJRobTaylor)

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank held interest rates on Thursday after the Federal Reserve delivered another widely anticipated hike, but trade deficit-laden Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to at least match the United States later in the day.

In a statement that marked the end of the era of "accommodative" monetary policy, Fed policymakers lifted the rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 2.00-2.25 percent. The U.S. central bank foresees another hike in December, three more next year, and one in 2020.

South Korea's central bank Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, as well as weakness in inflation and the job market weighed against policy tightening. Later on Thursday, Taiwan is also widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 1.375 percent.

"For many Asian economies, it will be domestic rather than external factors that drive their monetary policy," said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.

More fragile economies, however, cannot afford that luxury as their trade deficits expose them to portfolio outflows. They need to offer investors a hefty premium over U.S. rates to keep them on site and curb currency pressures.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is seen hiking rates by 50 bps to 4.50 percent later on Thursday to curb inflation and shore up the fragile peso, adding to the three hikes worth 100 bps since May.

"Emerging market economies, in particular, have already been facing tighter financial conditions this year, which have resurfaced some vulnerabilities as capital flows started reversing."

LESS SYNCHRONISED

Earlier in the day, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept rates at 1.75 percent, where they have been for the past two years, citing tepid inflation and the risk of a trade war.

"It’s far from being a curse. If you were to plot China’s credit growth against Asian emerging market GDP or even Australian GDP it’s virtually a perfect correlation."

 HDUPDATE 2-Traders keep bets on U.S. Fed's 2019  interest rate  rises   WC442 words   PD26 September 2018   ET23:26   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.

By Ann Saphir and Richard Leong
   TDSept 26 (Reuters) - Interest rates futures traders on Wednesday stuck with bets the Federal Reserve will raise rates once more this year and two times next year even after the central bank released forecasts flagging a slightly steeper rate rise path.

Contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate that are traded at CME Group's Chicago Board of Trade rose in the wake of the Fed's expected third rate increase in 2018 on Wednesday and after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat comments on the economy after the Fed's two-day meeting.

The higher pricing in the contracts was not large enough to alter traders' expectations for a Fed rate hike in December, which would bring it to a target range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. It implied traders expect two more rate increases in 2019.

Fed forecasts released on Wednesday showed Fed policymakers themselves view three rate hikes as likely needed next year.

"The projected path on interest rates is the same," said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in New York. "I think a December hike is pretty well baked in."

Meanwhile, policy-makers ended their long-running characterization of their policy stance as "accommodative."

The Fed "is probably close to being done raising rates even though they flagged a few more hikes," said Mark McCormick, head of TD Securities' North American FX strategy.

With unemployment at 3.9 percent, well below what most Fed officials view as sustainable in the long run, inflation was still expected to creep only slightly above the central bank's 2.0 percent target, Fed forecasts released Wednesday show.

Fed policymakers did not jack up their expectations for rate hikes in coming years, as some analysts had thought, instead sticking closely to rate hike path forecasts outlined in June that envision short-term rates, now at 2.0 percent to 2.25 percent, to be at 3.1 percent by the end of next year.

Their latest rate projections, together with Powell's comment that the Fed does not expect upside surprise on inflation, spurred a wave of buying in longer-dated Treasuries.

This trade flattened the yield curve, narrowing the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields to just a tad less than 23 basis points, which was the tightest level in more than a week. (Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

 HDUS Fed raises benchmark  interest rate  amid strong economy   BYHeather SCOTT    WC795 words   PD26 September 2018   ET23:37   SNAgence France Presse   SCAFPR   LAEnglish   CYCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2018 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved. 
   LPWith the US economy still strong, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the third time this year but showed no indication it would be more aggressive in efforts to head off inflation.

However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cautioned trade tensions remained a risk to the outlook, including the potential for rising prices, although he indicated it was too soon to tell what impact it this have on the economy.
   TDOn the brighter side, Powell said he did not see any "troubling" vulnerabilities in financial markets, even with stocks near their historic highs in some cases.

In a widely anticipated decision, the central bank boosted the lending rate to a range of 2.0 percent to 2.25 percent, a quarter-point increase in the target range.

Shortly after the announcement, President Donald Trump once again criticized the Fed for raising rates.

"Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little because we are doing so well. I'm not happy about that," Trump said at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

"I would rather pay down debt or do other things," he added. "So I'm worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates."

Asked earlier about Trump's previous criticism of Fed rate hikes which he said could undermine the booming economy, Powell said the central bank did not take "political factors" into consideration.

The Fed members "try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a complex of price stability.... We don't consider political factors or things like that," Powell told reporters.

And more moves are on the way with no hint of a pause, although the Fed did not give any sign it was about to become more hawkish and raise rates at a faster pace, as some analysts had suggested.

The Fed once again said "further gradual increases" would allow continued expansion of the economy while keeping inflation around the Fed's two percent target.

Powell said the gradual pace was helping to support the continued economic expansion, even as the benefits have not reached all Americans.

"Many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward," Powell said at a news conference following the announcement.

The statement on the unanimous decision no longer describes the interest rate level as "accommodative," but Powell stressed that that was not an indication of a change "in the path of policy."

The Fed has now raised the key rate eight times since late 2015, with one more expected in the final meeting of the year in December.

The central bank's decision comes amid worsening global trade tensions as President Donald Trump has doubled down on his confrontational stance, with steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods.

Powell said the Fed was hearing a "rising chorus" of concerns from businesses around the country about uncertainty and rising costs.

US companies worry about "disruption of supply chains, materials, cost increases, and loss of markets and things like that."

The Fed's concern is that that could lead to the "loss of business confidence and that can reduce investment."

"It's a risk. You could see prices moving up. We don't see it yet but you could see retail prices moving up," he said.

Wall Street did not appear terribly happy about the Fed decision, and after an initial uptick the three major stock indexes finished the day lower, although such moves are not unusual on the day of an interest rate move.

In their quarterly forecast, the central bankers did not signal that they would have to act more aggressively to constrain prices.

The median forecast continues to expect the federal funds rate to end the year at 2.4 percent, implying one more rate hike this year, and rising to 3.1 percent in 2019, which indicates three more moves.

"The message...was far less hawkish than the worst case in Wall Street forecasts," Chris Low, of FTN Financial, said in a research note.

However, the range of forecasts was spread widely with an equal number of central bankers expecting two, three or four increases in 2019.

Jim O'Sullivan of High-Frequency Economics said his team continued to expect four hikes next year.

"The dropping of the 'accommodative' reference could be viewed as dovish, but there is no hint of a pause," he said, and the updated projections are "consistent with policy becoming at least modestly restrictive in order to nudge the unemployment rate back up a little."

   LPUS central bankers are aware policy changes can put emerging economies under stress, but must focus on the domestic economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday.

However, the Fed makes extra effort to be transparent in communicating its moves to markets, so they can be prepared for interest rate changes, Powell said.
   TDThe Fed on Wednesday adopted its eighth rate hike in less than three years as the US economy has continued a robust expansion.

"We do understand, though, that when our economy is strong and we're raising rates, that puts upward pressure around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have external dollar borrowing," Powell told reporters at a news conference.

But he noted that more than half of the world's economic growth is outside of the United States.

"The performance of the emerging market economies really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate."

He said a healthy US economy was also good for other countries.

A decade of easy money following the financial crisis saw borrowing by developing nations nearly quadruple to $19 trillion, leaving countries like Turkey, Ukraine, Argentina, and even Qatar, Peru and Kazakhstan vulnerable, the ratings agency Fitch said earlier this year.

Increasing US interest rates can raise borrowing costs, especially for countries with large dollar-denominated debts, as it favors a stronger US currency and can drive investors out of emerging economies toward the increasing yields on US assets.

"What we try to do is be very transparent about what we're doing and why, and we have been, I believe, and we've also moved quite gradually," Powell said.

"We'll continue to conduct US monetary policy as transparently as we possibly can, and that's really the best thing we can do along with supporting US growth."

   LPThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Wednesday afternoon was holding on to tenuous gains after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as expected, with benchmark U.S. government bond rates failing to push significantly higher thereafter. The Dow was up about 0.1% at 26,571, with shares of components Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), American Express Co. (AXP) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) all trading lower following the Fed's decision to lift rates to a range of 2% to 2.25%, marking its third rate increase of 2018, with the central bank setting the stage for a fourth in December. The Federal Open Market Committee also removed the term "accommodative," in characterizing its monetary policy, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized during a 2:30 p.m. Eastern news conference following the release of the Fed's updated policy package, that policy, in fact, remains accommodative, but wanted to signal that the domestic economy is getting stronger.
   TD Still, financials sank as the 10-year Treasury yield fell to around 3.06%, compared with 3.08% prior to the Fed decision at 2 p.m. A popular gauge of the financial sector, Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF), was down 0.8%, representing the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 index . Ordinarily, banks' business models benefit from a rising interest-rate environment.

   LPThe Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the third time this year but showed no indication it would be more aggressive in efforts to head off inflation.

The central bank boosted the lending rate to 2.0 percent to 2.25 percent, a quarter-point increase in the target range, and more are on the way, with no hint of a pause.
   TDIt once again said "further gradual increases" would allow continued expansion of the economy while keeping inflation around the Fed's two percent target.

However, the closely scrutinized statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee removed a longstanding phrase which described the Fed's rate stance as providing stimulus to the economy.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the gradual pace is helping to support the continued economic expansion, even as the benefits have not reached all Americans.

"Many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward," Powell said at a news conference following the announcement.

The statement on the unanimous decision no longer describes the rate level as "accommodative," while continuing to note the strong gains in economic activity and employment.

But Powell stressed that that was not an indication of a change "in the path of policy."

The Fed has now raised the key rate eight times since late 2015, with one more expected in the final meeting of the year in December.

The central bank's decision comes amid worsening global trade tensions as President Donald Trump has doubled down on his confrontational stance, with steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods.

"It's a risk. You could see prices moving up. We don't see it yet but you could see retail prices moving up," he said.

The Fed members "try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a complex of price stability.... We don't consider political factors or things like that," Powell told reporters.

In their quarterly forecast, the central bankers did not signal that they would have to act more aggressively to constrain prices, as the inflation forecast for next year was slightly lower than in June, while the interest rate outlook was unchanged.

The median forecast continues to expect the federal funds rate to end the year at 2.4 percent, implying one more rate hike -- as is widely expected in December.

The rate is seen rising to 3.1 percent in 2019 -- the same as the last forecast -- which indicates three more moves, as inflation is expected to hold at the Fed's goal of two percent.

"The message...was far less hawkish than the worst case in Wall Street forecasts," Chris Low, of FTN Financial, said in a research note. "As a result, bonds are rallying."

The Fed's preferred price index, based on consumer spending, rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months ended in July, the strongest since March 2012. But excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation rate rose 2.0 percent, which hits the Fed's goal.

However, while the median forecast for the target interest rate is unchanged, the range is spread widely with an equal number of central bankers expecting two, three or four increases in 2019.

And Powell noted that forecasts were highly uncertain, with the actual decision depending on how the economy and inflation evolve.

 HDWhat a Fed rate hike means for you, at any age   BYBY SARAH SKIDMORE SELL and STAN CHOE    CRAP Business Writers   WC1,263 words   PD26 September 2018   ET21:22   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPNo matter your age, what the Federal Reserve does to interest rates will most likely affect you.

The central bank raised what's called the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent Wednesday, the third such increase this year.
   TDAn increase creates a ripple effect for rates on a variety of loans and investments.

"Interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing," said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference following the rate increase. But Powell pointed out that rates are "still quite low by historical levels."

Higher rates can mean different things to people, depending on where they are in life. In general, for people borrowing money, it means life is getting more expensive. For savers, it means slightly bigger rewards. Here's a look at some of the effects:

FOR 20-SOMETHINGS

What's rising even faster than college tuitions? The financing costs to pay for them.

Student-loan rates have been climbing along with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has risen above 3 percent. Undergraduate students taking out federal direct loans this school year will pay a fixed 5.05 percent interest rate. That's a significant jump from the 4.45 percent rate of the prior school year, and it's the highest since 2009-10, when it was 5.6 percent.

The rate is fixed, so direct federal loans taken out for the 2018-19 academic year will keep the 5.05 percent rate. The Fed reiterated Wednesday that it expects to raise rates one more time this year and another three times in 2019. Unless that changes, long-term rates would also rise, so student loans taken out next year will likely have a higher rate.

Interest rates for private loans are already traditionally higher and will likely rise as well.

Additionally, it's easy in your 20s to start to slide down the slippery slope of credit card debt. Try to resist because carrying a balance is only going to get more expensive ahead.

Credit card rates are most sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate, almost directly matching the rate change with a 1.92-point increase since late 2015 when the Fed began to hike rates, said Nick Clements, co-founder of MagnifyMoney.com, a financial information website.

Clements estimates that with this latest hike, the average household that carries credit card debt month to month will pay over $150 in extra interest per year compared with before the rate hikes began. MagnifyMoney estimates 122 million Americans carry credit card debt month to month.

FOR YOUNG(ISH) WORKERS - 30s and 40s

It's a busy time financially — people in this age group may be focused on paying down debts such as auto loans, mortgages and student loans while also trying to stoke their savings.

Pay off any variable-rate debts ASAP. That means paying down credit cards, home equity lines of credit and student loans from private lenders as quickly as possible before these borrowing costs rise.

To put this in perspective, since the Fed began raising rates, the average credit card rate has jumped from 15.78 percent to 17.32 percent; the average home equity line of credit has climbed from 4.75 percent to 6.08 percent, according to Bankrate.com. And those with adjustable rate mortgages expecting a rate reset this year will see the rate jump to 5.25 percent or more.

Speaking of mortgages, because interest rates are on an upward trajectory, new mortgage debt will also most likely be getting more expensive.

The fed funds rate and mortgages don't always move in lockstep for a number of reasons. But since late 2015, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has increased from approximately 3.9 percent to 4.6 percent, as of Sept. 13.

If you are looking for a mortgage, shop around for the best rate. If you have an adjustable rate mortgage that is expected to reset higher soon, consider refinancing to a lower fixed-rate now.

Meanwhile, members of this group should also save for retirement and build up their emergency savings. For the latter, consider banking online, where you can find numerous savings accounts with rates around 2 percent.

FOR NEAR-RETIREMENT OR RETIRED — 50, 60, 70 AND BEYOND

Huzzah. Savers are finally earning more on their cash — if only just a bit.

The national rate for a 12-month CD is 0.45 percent, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That sounds like a pittance of interest, but it's double the rate from a couple years ago.

Rates for longer-term CDs are also rising, and the national rate for a five-year CD is up to 1.11 percent from 0.87 percent a year ago.

Such low figures mean many savers still aren't keeping up with inflation, but analysts expect rates to continue trending higher. Savers can also typically find better rates at online banks than at traditional ones — they sometimes even match the rate of inflation, which was 2.7 percent last month. For a three-year CD, several online banks offer rates at that level or slightly higher.

Now on to those investments you worked so hard on.

Higher interest rates hurt investors with bond funds in their 401(k) accounts, at least in the short term. A rise in rates makes the bonds sitting in a bond fund's portfolio suddenly less attractive, when compared against newly issued bonds that are paying more in interest. That causes those bonds' prices to drop, and the dynamic has caused many of the most popular bond funds to lose money this year.

The largest bond fund by assets is down 2.1 percent through Monday, for example. But those funds will also be earning more in interest thanks to the higher rates and should be able to offset those losses in the long run, as long as rates rise gradually.

Stock funds should also feel an effect, and emerging-market funds have been among the biggest losers recently. But as long as the rise in rates is due to a strengthening economy, rather than fears about a surge in inflation, analysts say stock funds should be able to hold steady. That's because a better economy usually spells higher corporate profits.

   LPThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Wednesday afternoon was holding on to tenuous gains after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as expected, with benchmark U.S. government bond rates failing to push significantly higher thereafter. The Dow was up about 0.1% at 26,571, with shares of components Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), American Express Co. (AXP) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) all trading lower following the Fed's decision to lift rates to a range of 2% to 2.25%, marking its third rate increase of 2018, with the central bank setting the stage for a fourth in December. The Federal Open Market Committee also removed the term "accommodative," in characterizing its monetary policy, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized during a 2:30 p.m. Eastern news conference following the release of the Fed's updated policy package, that policy, in fact, remains accommodative, but wanted to signal that the domestic economy is getting stronger.
   TD Still, financials sank as the 10-year Treasury yield fell to around 3.06%, compared with 3.08% prior to the Fed decision at 2 p.m. A popular gauge of the financial sector, Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF), was down 0.8%, representing the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 index . Ordinarily, banks' business models benefit from a rising interest-rate environment.

   LP1445 ET - In his press conference after the FOMC meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was asked about whether President Donald Trump's criticism of rate rises are a problem. Powell doesn't say the president's name and falls back on central bank boilerplate, noting "we don't consider political factors or things like that" when making policy. Instead, he says the Fed focuses on its mission. (michael.derby@wsj.com)
   TD1415 ET - US government bond yields tick lower, then pare their declines, after the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates and removes the word "accommodative" from its policy statement. Investors had been widely expecting the central bank to raise rates in September, but had been less sure of whether the Fed would signal a more aggressive approach to future rate increases. That had driven yields higher heading into Wednesday's meeting, although traders said on first glance, the Fed's latest policy statement didn't strike them as being hawkish. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell to around 3.065% before recently trading at 3.078%, compared with 3.102% Tuesday. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1411 ET - The Fed's interest rate forecasts may not hold any great surprises relative to what was seen in June, but it's notable that central bankers see an extended period of time of running monetary policy above its long run level. The Fed may be dispensing with descriptions of policy as "accommodative" and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may be pushed the concept of neutral rates off to the margin. Still, against the Fed's estimate of a long-term fed funds target rate of 3%, they see monetary policy delivering rates above that in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Given the duration of the business cycle, trade war rumblings and the worries about the yield curve, it will be very interesting to see if the Fed can deliver on such a hawkish policy outlook. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1410 ET - The September Federal Reserve policy statement showed no change in officials' characterization of the economy and its strength compared with the previous policy statement. Officials said the labor market has continued to strengthen, while the economy has been rising at a strong pace. Meanwhile, inflation remains near the central bank's 2% target. The main change in September's statement, other than the rate increase decision, was the drop of "accommodative" in the description of interest rates. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com)

1407 ET - Twelve of 16 Fed officials now expect four interest rate increases this year, more than in previous months, according to new economic projections. In June, eight Fed officials expected at least four rate rises in 2018. The higher number of officials projecting four rate bumps signals a stronger belief among officials that the economy is running strong, necessitating gradual rate increases to keep it from overheating. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com)

1404 ET - Federal Reserve officials removed language in their policy statement that had described short-term interest rates as "accommodative," meaning they are still low enough to stimulate economic growth. Most officials think rates are still accommodative but are becoming less so with each rate increase, and are on track to reach a neutral level that neither spurs nor slows growth in coming months. The problem is officials' aren't sure where neutral lies or when they'll get there. Waiting until later this year or next year to drop the phrase would have risked sending an unintended message then that they agreed they were at neutral, which they are unlikely to do, given the uncertainties involved. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com)

1402 ET - Central bank officials voted to raise their benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range between 2% and 2.25%, according to Wednesday's policy statement. The decision to raise interest rates for the third time this year is in line with expectations for the Fed to gradually raise rates as the economy remains on a path of strength. The bigger question is how Fed Chairman Jerome Powell might characterize the balance of risks at the press conference. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com)

1341 ET - One key thing to watch after the Fed meeting, assuming a rate rise happens, is what happens with the yield curve. The difference between two and 10-year Treasury securities continues to stand within spitting distance of going negative, with the spread currently right around 25 basis points. It's possible a rate rise or two more, which the Fed could easily deliver this year, could kick that spread into negative territory, with ominous portents for the economic outlook. Some key Fed officials like New York Fed leader John Williams have downplayed this relationship, but others, like St Louis' James Bullard, have cautioned against doing the "this time it's different" argument. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1325 ET - This year's rate tightening campaign has been met with not a single dissenting vote. That's unlikely to change today, as all of the voting members have indicated they're on board with further action. Personal shifts, most notably John Williams moving from the San Francisco Fed to New York, haven't altered the balance. There will be one new voting member with the entrance of Richard Clarida as vice-chair, but nobody expects him to dissent. Perhaps the one curiosity in FOMC voting patterns this year has been Raphael Bostic in Atlanta, the first African-American regional bank head in the Fed's history. Left leaning activists wanted a minority, believing such a person would be more sensitive to how marginalized groups experience monetary policy. But by and large, Bostic has been on board with rate rises, even when the activists opposed them. FOMC voting patterns may become more interesting with the final two meetings, when Mary Daly takes over in San Francisco. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1255 ET - Capital Economics notes today that over the last year, the Fed really hasn't run down its balance sheet all that much. So far, its only shed about $250B off what was $4.5 trillion in holdings. They also note that at the current pace it won't be until 2021 that the balance sheet goes under the $3 trillion mark. Capital Economics observes in its note that credit activity has been wholly unaffected by balance sheet shrinkage. On the upside for the Fed, the drawdown continues to be a complete nonevent for financial markets. About the only time the balance sheet has bubbled up as an issue is when some speculated tweaks to the Fed's drawdown strategy could help ward off an inversion of the yield curve.

The update follows the announcement that the bank agreed to sold a portfolio of EUR2.8 billion of gross loans, including EUR2.7 billion of non-performing loans, equivalent to about a third of the bank's total NPLs. According to Fitch Ratings, the transaction "will be positive for the BoC's credit risk profile and will reduce capital encumbrance by unreserved problem assets." It is expected to be finalised by end-2018 or first quarter of next year. It expresses the view that "the execution risk on the transaction is small given the strong incentives for all involved parties to complete the deal." (nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com)

1117 ET - Emerging markets are likely to experience further weakness, says Rabobank. The economic slowdown in China "will not only be a drag on the value of the remnibi versus the dollar in the months ahead" but it will dampen investors' risk appetite "for some time." Ebbing risk appetite is "detrimental" to emerging market assets. "In contrast, strong growth and higher yields in the U.S. are likely to continue supporting broad-based dollar," which has been behind most of the fall in emerging market assets.

   LPThe Federal Reserve voted unanimously to lift a key U.S. interest rate by a quarter point, but the central bank is sticking to its gradualist strategy of raising the cost of borrowing. The Fed predicts one more rate hike by December and three more in 2019, unchanged from its prior forecast. After a two-day meeting, the Fed on Wednesday raised its short-term fed funds rate to a range of 2% to 2.25%, marking the highest level in a decade. In a surprising twist, though, the Fed dropped longstanding language from its policy statement saying its monetary policy "remains accommodative." The removal of that phrase suggests the Fed could even pause at some point to assess the effect of its actions on the economy. The FOMC boosted its forecast for U.S. growth in 2018 to 3.1% from 2.8%, but it expects GDP to eventually slow to as low as 1.8% by 2021.

   LPThe Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the third time this year but showed no indication it would be more aggressive in efforts to head off inflation.

The central bank boosted the lending rate to 2.0 percent - 2.25 percent, a quarter-point increase in the target range.
   TDIt once again said "further gradual increases" would allow continued expansion of the economy while keeping inflation around the Fed's two percent target.

However, the closely scrutinized statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee removed a longstanding phrase which described the Fed's rate stance as providing stimulus to the economy.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a news conference later Wednesday to explain the thinking behind the unanimous decision.

"The committee expects that further gradual increases...will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee's symmetric two percent objective over the medium term," the statement said.

But the statement no longer describes the rate level as "accommodative," while continuing to note the strong gains in economic activity and employment.

The Fed has now raised the key rate eight times since late 2015, with one more expected in the final meeting of the year in December.

In their quarterly forecast, the central bankers did not signal that they would have to act more aggressively to constrain prices, as the inflation forecast for next year was slightly lower than in June, while the interest rate outlook was unchanged.

The median forecast continues to expect the federal funds rate to end the year at 2.4 percent, implying one more rate hike -- as is widely expected in December.

The rate is seen rising to 3.1 percent in 2019 -- the same as the last forecast -- which indicates three more moves, as inflation is expected to hold at the Fed's goal of two percent.

The Fed's preferred price index, based on consumer spending, rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months ended in July, the strongest since March 2012. But excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation rate rose 2.0 percent, which hits the Fed's goal.

26 Sep 2018 14:00 ET  Fed Raises Interest Rates, Signals One More Increase This Year


 By Nick Timiraos 

WASHINGTON-The Federal Reserve said it will raise short-term interest rates by another quarter-percentage point, and officials signaled they want to continue lifting them through the next year to keep a strong economy on an even keel.

Officials voted unanimously Wednesday on the increase, which will bring the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%. Most officials expect to raise rates one more time this year, according to new projections released after the meeting.

The increase is the third this year and the eighth since the Fed began to lift rates in late 2015 after keeping them pinned near zero after the 2008 financial crisis.

Wednesday's decision marks the first time that the Fed has raised rates above 2% since a series of rate cuts that followed the government's intervention in March 2008 to prevent the liquidation of Bear Stearns Cos.

It also is the first time in a decade rates will rise above inflation, measured by the Fed's preferred gauge, excluding volatile energy and food categories. So-called core prices rose 2% in July.

The Fed over the past year has returned interest rates to a more normal setting while also gradually reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets.

The big question now is how much further officials think they need to go to raise rates to keep the economy from overheating. The Fed targets a 2% inflation rate, which it sees as a sign of healthy demand. It wants to avoid economic growth that becomes unsustainable, leading to a boom and then bust.

Altogether, these moves should ripple through the economy by steadily raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Rising mortgage rates, for example, appear to have slowed home sales this year. Higher borrowing costs steal pricing power from sellers who have benefited from rising prices in recent years.

Fed officials removed a phrase from their post-meeting statement that for years has described their rate stance as "accommodative," meaning they are pressing on the gas pedal to help stimulate growth.

Dropping the language now doesn't necessarily signal that officials believe rates are no longer low enough to stimulate growth. Instead, the change reflects how officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, want to move away from providing overly precise estimates of where such a neutral setting stands given the inherent uncertainty in such measures.

The Fed made no other changes to its statement, which it has now purged of nearly all references to the future stance of monetary policy. Removing such forward guidance reflects how the central bank is moving into a new phase of policy setting that could be more uncertain.

Twelve of 16 officials now expect the Fed will raise rates a total of four times this year, up from eight of 15 officials in June and just four of 16 last December.

Most officials expect the Fed would need to raise rates at least three more times next year and once more in 2020. Most officials see the Fed refraining from additional rate increases after that, leaving rates in a range between 3.25% and 3.5% by the end of 2020 and through 2021.

The new interest-rate guidance shows most Fed officials believe they will need to raise short-term rates slightly beyond the level they expect is likely to prevail when supply and demand are perfectly balanced. Two thirds of officials expect that longer-run rate sits around 2.75% or 3%.

Fed officials have upgraded their economic outlook over the past year, first because of a synchronized upturn in global growth beginning last summer, and later after Congress approved stimulus in the form of tax cuts and increased federal spending.

Officials made few changes to their economic projections in September. The median projection now sees gross domestic product rising 3.1% this year, up from 2.8% in June and 2.7% in March. Officials continued to estimate the economy's long run growth rate sits at 1.8% and that growth will return to that level by 2021.

Officials nudged up their unemployment forecast. They expect the jobless rate will end the year at 3.7%, versus a projection of 3.6% in June. That is still below all officials' estimates of the level of unemployment they expect to prevail over the long run. Estimates of this so-called natural rate of unemployment range from 4% to 4.6%.

Their inflation projections were virtually unchanged. All officials see inflation holding between 2% and 2.3% over the coming years after several years in which the Fed struggled to reach the target.

Just how much more the Fed continues to raise rates will depend largely on whether inflation behaves as they expect it to.

One camp of officials says so long as unemployment keeps falling farther below the level that they project is consistent with stable prices, the Fed will need to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating. This is an uncontroversial strategy because it is what the central bank always does at this point in an expansion.

Another camp argues for a relatively radical departure from this norm. These officials say if inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a "neutral" setting designed to neither spur nor slow growth.

Mr. Powell hasn't revealed his preference, but in an August speech he sounded sympathetic to treating the traditional models more skeptically than some of his colleagues or staff.

Given the strength of the U.S. economy, turbulence abroad represents perhaps the biggest risk to the Fed's plans. In 2015 and 2016, officials held back planned rate increases due to upheaval in global markets, mostly emanating from China.

The Fed could be forced to reconsider its plans if something similar occurs, for example, if a stronger dollar triggers upheaval in emerging markets, which in turns spills into China amid rising trade tensions with the U.S.

 HDCANADA FX DEBT-C$ treads water ahead of expected U.S. Fed rate hike   WC417 words   PD26 September 2018   ET15:20   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved.

    * Canadian dollar at 1.2955 to greenback, or 77.19 US cents
    * Price of U.S. oil falls 0.6 percent
    * Canadian bond prices trade mixed across the yield curve

    TORONTO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little
changed against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, trading in a
narrow range as oil prices fell and the U.S. dollar climbed
ahead of an expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal
Reserve.
    At 8:59 a.m. (1259 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was
nearly unchanged at 1.2955 to the greenback, or 77.19 U.S.
cents.
    The currency, which last Thursday touched its strongest
level in more than three months at 1.2885, traded in a narrow
range of 1.2945 to 1.2966.    
    The U.S. dollar        rose against a basket of major
currencies before a widely anticipated Fed rate hike priced in
by investors still on edge about a trade row between the United
States and China.             
    Canada has its own trade dispute with the United States and
is in slow-moving talks to renew the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).
    The country is not making concessions needed to reach a deal
with the United States for a trilateral NAFTA pact and is
running out of time before Washington proceeds with a
Mexico-only agreement, a top U.S. official said on Tuesday.
            
    As the month-end deadline for the trade talks nears,
Canadian executives who hedge foreign exchange risk have been
changing their strategies so their companies can profit from any
possible swings in the Canadian dollar.             
    The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, eased but
was still heading for a fifth consecutive quarter of gains,
driven by an impending drop in Iranian exports in the last three
months of the year when global demand heats up.             
    U.S. crude        prices were down 0.6 percent at $71.84 a
barrel.
    Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield
curve, with the 10-year             rising 1 Canadian cent to
yield 2.459 percent. On Tuesday, the 10-year yield touched its
highest intraday in more than four months at 2.472 percent.
    Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz is due to speak on
Thursday, while Canadian gross domestic product data for July is
due on Friday.

   LPThis is the web version of the WSJ's newsletter on the economy. You can sign up for daily delivery here.

Good morning. Today we look at the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates, the future of Nafta, and absolutely exuberant American consumers.
   TDHIGHER AND HIGHER

The Federal Reserve is set to raise short-term interest rates Wednesday -- the eighth increase since late 2015 and third this year. It doesn't look like officials are ready to stop. At their June meeting, a narrow majority projected the Fed would raise rates a total of four times in 2018. That group is likely to grow this week. The bigger question: What happens next year?

The WSJ's Nick Timiraos writes that there are two schools of thought. 1.) Conventional wisdom : Low and falling unemployment means the Fed will need to raise rates to slow the economy and prevent it from overheating. 2.) Radical departure : As long as inflation doesn't appear to be accelerating beyond 2%, the Fed could stop raising rates after reaching a "neutral" setting designed to neither spur nor slow growth.

Extra: We'll also get revised projections on future rate moves (the dot plot) and the economy. Finally, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell steps up to the mic at 2:30 p.m. ET to hash it all out with reporters.

WHAT TO WATCH TODAY

U.S. new-home sales for August, out at 10 a.m. ET, are expected to edge up to an annual pace of 630,000 from 627,000.

The Federal Reserve releases a policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m., and Chairman Jerome Powell holds a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

President Trump spends another day at the United Nations. He's set to meet separately with the prime ministers of Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom.

TOP STORIES

KEEP ON LIFTING

The Fed influences interest rates across the economy, but it doesn't dictate them. Average rates for credit cards, auto loans and home-equity lines of credit have all drifted higher as the Fed lifted its benchmark. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now at the highest level since 2011, according to Freddie Mac. But the average rate on a 5-year new-car loan is still lower than in 2011, when the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate was near zero, according to Bankrate.com. Ultimately, consumer borrowing costs are set in the markets based on a variety of factors, Paul Kiernan reports.

ADIOS, CANADA

The Trump administration's top trade negotiator threatened to move forward with a bilateral accord with Mexico amid a lack of progress with Canada on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trump administration's threat raises uncertainties for business leaders and farmers: the treaty has allowed automobile makers and other industries to create supply chains that span the continent. A bilateral trade deal would disrupt those supply chains and raise the possibility of a eventual price increases, William Mauldin reports. There's an end-of-month deadline to reach a deal.

I WON'T BACK DOWN

President Trump criticized international organizations and alliances as unaccountable and defended his administration's hard-line trade policies at the United Nations General Assembly. "We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated and our wealth to be plundered and transferred," he said. "America will never apologize for protecting our citizens."

WINS AND LOSSES

The conventional wisdom is that a trade war will hit U.S. partners harder than the U.S. But a paper by the European Central Bank estimates that a trade war with the rest of the world could knock about 2% off of U.S. economic growth, while China and other economies could gain. ECB economists modeled a scenario in which the U.S. raises tariffs on all of its imports by 10 percentage points, and its trading partners retaliate in kind. The higher tariffs would reduce household incomes and hurt business confidence, weighing on private consumption and investment, Tom Fairless writes.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING CONFIDENT?

U.S. consumer confidence hit an 18-year high in September as robust job growth and a strong economic outlook bolstered Americans' expectations for the future. The latest reading suggests Americans aren't too worried about trade tensions. Instead, lofty sentiment bodes well for consumer spending and economic growth, Harriet Torry writes. Macroeconomic Advisers is tracking third-quarter gross domestic product at a 3.3% annual pace and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is forecasting 4.4%.

TWEET OF THE DAY

I mean, imagine not being able to get along with Canada.

-- Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) September 25, 2018

WHAT ELSE WE'RE READING

Men are doves and women are hawks. "[T]his column finds that for the same level of inflation, a higher share of women on the central bank board is associated with a higher interest rate. The findings suggest that women in central banks have a more hawkish attitude, and that heterogeneity of monetary policy committees can have an impact on monetary policy decisions," Donato Masciandaro, Paola Profeta and Davide Romelli write at the Center for Economic Policy Research.

Women do better in science, tech, engineering and math when there are other women in their programs. "[W]e show that women entering cohorts with no female peers are 11.9pp less likely to graduate within 6 years than their male counterparts. A 1 [standard deviation] increase in the percentage of female students differentially increases the probability of on-time graduation for women by 4.6pp," Valerie Bostwick and Bruce Weinberg write in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.

 HDFed's Introduction of 2021 Rate Projections May Cap Short-Term Rates: ING -- Market Talk   WC1,386 words   PD26 September 2018   ET12:06   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP1006 GMT - The Federal Reserve in its monetary policy announcement on Wednesday could introduce the 2021 dot in its "dot plot" interest-rate projections. If the median dot remains at 3.4%, that "would put an end-date on the hiking cycle," ING says. This would "cap short-term U.S. rates for now," as well as the dollar, according to ING. "The projections are typically extended by one year at September meetings and here the focus will be on where officials see policy heading in 2021." The Fed decision is at 1800 GMT. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)
   TD0955 GMT - Market participants are pricing in 50 basis points of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in 2019, and if the Fed says later on Wednesday that it no longer sees its policy as "accommodative", these expectations won't extend much further, says ING. "If the Fed were to no longer see U.S. monetary policy as being accommodative...one could infer that we are now in the latter stages of the tightening cycle - with policy approaching a neutral stance." Therefore, "policy moves may well be more data and market dependent - meaning limited need for investors to price in further Fed tightening." The Fed is expected to raise rates on Wednesday by 25 bps to 2.25%. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

0948 GMT - The Italian government is eventually likely to respect the fiscal rules because "they need financial markets on their side to raise funding for at least part of their plans," says Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management. The budget, to be presented on Thursday, might show a fiscal deficit of 1.6% to 2% of GDP for 2019, higher than last year's but roughly in line with this year's expected outcome, and is likely to be "reluctantly accepted by Brussels," she says. Ms. Dall'Angelo says gradualism will probably be the government's key word and the budget plan will probably include some watered-down versions of the promised policies. (emese.bartha@wsj.com' @EmeseBartha)

0945 GMT - Independent credit research firm CreditSights holds an "underperform" recommendation on Vodafone bonds, it says as the telecommuncations company comes to the market with a four-tranche multi-currency hybrid issuance. The recommendation reflects Vodafone's willingness to raise leverage to fill its infrastructure gap versus incumbents, while pressure in its core European markets, combined with spectrum auctions act as a headwind to near-term deleveraging, CreditSights says. That said, it expects Vodafone's hybrid deal to go well. The issuance comes more at fair value than necessarily cheap but technicals are supportive given scarcity and diversification benefits, CreditSights says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0943 GMT - A rate increase by the Czech central bank on Wednesday seems to be a "done deal," says Komercni's analyst Dalimil Vyskovsky, adding that the board is likely to point to a weaker currency as the main reason for the increase. The reaction of the EUR/CZK, currently trading flat at 25.5903, could be key, he says. If the Czech koruna weakens, then the market "might restart pricing more hikes going forward, though we still have some 80% of the November tightening priced in," he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0912 GMT - The greenback moving little ahead of today's Fed pronouncement has meant little doing for currencies generally. But maybe the Singapore dollar will ease some afterward. UOB estimates the currency is 1.2% above the midpoint of its nominal effective exchange-rate band and predicts the local currency will trade 0.5-1.5% above it. Versus the US dollar, that implies a range of S$1.3623-1.3759 based on currency levels this morning. The greenback remains around S$1.3650. (gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com)

0831 GMT - The central bank in the Czech Republic is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.50% when it announces a policy decision at 1100 GMT, but this is unlikely to move the Czech koruna. The decision is widely anticipated and already priced into the currency, as is a further rate rise to 1.75% by the end of this year, says UniCredit. "Barring any new signals coming from the CNB today, which we do not expect, EUR/CZK has likely built out a base at current levels," UniCredit says. EUR/CZK is last down 0.1% at 25.5833. "From current levels, we believe the risk is still to the upside for EUR/CZK." (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

0815 GMT - Emerging market currencies "are not out of the woods" even though a Federal Reserveinterest rate increase later on Wednesday is widely expected, says UniCredit. The simultaneous action of the Fed unwinding its balance sheet, coupled with increased U.S. Treasury issuance, "may still tighten global liquidity conditions in the months ahead and weigh on several EM currencies." However, if U.S. inflation were to come in below expectations on Friday, this "could provide some more support to EM." Most EM currencies are up against the dollar on Wednesday. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

0804 GMT - Singapore manufacturing activity will likely slow further in 4Q with downside pressures coming from escalations in US-China trade tensions, Maybank says as it expects the trade-dependent economy to cool in coming quarters. Combined with impacts from July's residential-property cooling measures on the service sector and the bank predicts 2.6% GDP growth for this quarter, versus 2Q's 3.9%. As such, Maybank doesn't see Singapore's central bank tightening further next month. (saurabh.chaturvedi@wsj.com; @journosaurabh)

0750 GMT - Italy's budget for 2019, to be presented on Thursday, "remains a key point of uncertainty" amid varied news on the size of deficit but a below 2% gap could give further support to Italian government bonds, says Societe Generale. "A sub 2% deficit may provide BTPs with further support but we continue to see significant uncertainties around passing the budget and [credit] ratings," say Societe Generale's rates strategists. Italian government bond prices have firmed in recent days, driving yields lower, on hopes that the country's government will present a market-friendly budget plan for next year. The 10-year BTP yield is trading at 2.86%, down one basis point, according to Factset. Yields move inversely to prices. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0727 GMT - The 10-year Italian BTP-German Bund yield spread should narrow toward 200-210 basis points if Italy's macro numbers for 2019 are as "constructive" as UniCredit expects, says rates strategist Chiara Cremonesi, referring to a budget deficit close to 2%. Italy's government is expected to present its budget draft for 2019 on Thursday. The 200-210 basis point spread is an initial target and the tightening could be even more pronounced "if some of the non-resident investors that sharply reduced their exposure to Italian government bonds in May and June returned, Ms. Cremonesi says. The spread is currently 235 basis points, according to FactSet. Investors with a more long-term strategy may wait rating reviews by Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings before extending their exposure to Italy, though, Ms. Cremonesi says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0721 GMT - Italy's funding outlook until year-end looks "smooth," says Chiara Cremonesi, rates strategist at UniCredit. She calculates that after Thursday's end-of-the-month government bond auction, Italy will have to issue around EUR35 billion in medium- and long-term debt until year's end. UniCredit expects Italy's average monthly issuance at EUR17 billion in October and November, down from a monthly average of EUR20 billion in the year to date, she says. UniCredit expects the Italian treasury to cancel the mid-December bond auction, in line with previous years. The analyst says net supply will be negative until the end of the year as issuance will be accompanied by EUR54 billion of redemptions in the October to December period.

Time to Put ‘Accommodative' Fed Language Out of Its Misery?

Federal Reserve watchers are split over whether the central bank will remove "accommodative" in describing its monetary policy when it releases its latest statement Wednesday.

The term indicates Fed interest-rate policy remains supportive of the economy. And for some time now, it has been a signal more rate rises were coming.

But now, the Fed's at a crossroads. Officials generally believe rate rises will no longer stop at neutral levels but go beyond that. With the unemployment rate well under what officials view as its sustainable level, and inflation hanging around the 2% target, monetary policy may have to lean against the economy's momentum to prevent overheating and keep the expansion going.

Fed officials also are shifting their views about what constitutes a neutral level of interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in August he is less inclined to guide the economy by variables that rely on unmeasurable estimates, which means it may be harder to know when policy is no longer accommodative. At the same time, there are signs that the natural rate of interest, which still is looked to by many Fed officials, is shifting higher.

All those moving pieces have left economists split as to whether "accommodative" lives or dies in the Federal Open Market Committee statement.

"Fed officials have been increasingly uncomfortable describing policy in terms of estimates of R-star," economists at J.P. Morgan wrote in a note, referring to the so-called natural rate of interest. "It is against this backdrop that we anticipate the statement will remove previous references to policy being ‘accommodative.'"

Wrightson ICAP's economists also see the word dropping out, as officials chop off a vestigial limb. "It is just the next step in the Fed's ongoing effort to disengage from the forward guidance framework that was part of its response to the Great Recession," the forecasting firm said.

Jefferies economist Ward McCarthy expects "accommodative" to stay in the statement, but he expects officials to "modify the wording to convey the message that policy is becoming gradually less accommodative."

Goldman Sachs economists say the word is "a touch more likely than not to remain," although they say that the rate forecasts shown in the central bank's "dot plot" are the far more important variable right now.

NatWest Markets economists also see a case for the status quo. "Given that the funds rate will still be below participants' views of the long-run neutral rate after the September hike, we expect the FOMC to again indicate that ‘the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative,'" as officials did in their most recent FOMC statement.

Key Developments Around the World

Federal Reserve Readies Third Interest-Rate Increase of 2018

The Federal Reserve is prepared to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point after its two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday, the eighth such move since late 2015. Officials will also present revised projections of future rate moves along with their outlook for inflation, employment and growth. The central bank releases its policy statement and the forecasts—the so-called dot plot—at 2 p.m. EDT. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell takes media questions at 2:30 p.m. Here is a look at what to watch.

Modest Consumer Rate Rises Based on Variety of Factors

U.S. consumer borrowing costs have drifted higher in recent months ahead of the Federal Reserve's likely decision Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates, though the increases have generally been modest. Average rates for credit cards, 30-year mortgages, auto loans and home-equity lines of credit have all risen since June 13, when the central bank announced a quarter-percentage-point increase in its benchmark rate and penciled in two more such moves this year.

J.P. Morgan Goes Looking for Job-Market Bubbles, Sees a Few Candidates

Most Federal Reserve officials reckon that, at a 3.9% jobless rate, the job market is running hotter than what they consider to be sustainable. The strength of the job sector raises the question: Have any parts of the labor landscape become overheated? According to a note from J.P. Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton, a jobless rate that has blown through the Fed's estimate of a 4.5% sustainable rate hasn't led to a lot of worrisome overheating, at least not yet. But he estimates that if things turned south for the economy, the tech and restaurant sectors look most inclined to take it on the chin.

ECB Projects U.S. Could Be Biggest Casualty of a Global Trade Conflict

The U.S. economy could shrink about 2% in the first year of a trade war with the rest of the world, while China and other economies could gain, according to new research published Wednesday by the European Central Bank. ECB officials have been fretting publicly for months about the impact of rising trade protectionism on the export-focused eurozone. The 19-nation economy has slowed this year, just as the ECB starts to tilt away from years of easy money.

Argentina's Central Bank President Resigns

Argentina central bank President Luis Caputo resigned less than four months into his post as the government struggles to contain economic turmoil and social unrest while it renegotiates a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Caputo on Tuesday cited personal reasons for his departure amid reports of disputes with the IMF over Argentina's exchange-rate policy. He will be succeeded by Guido Sandleris, a top Finance Ministry official who has a Ph.D. from Columbia University, specializing in finance, macroeconomics and the international economy. Mr. Sandleris had previously taught at Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires and was a visiting researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the IMF.

Brazil's Central Bank Hints at Rate Increases

Brazil's central bank Tuesday said inflation risks have increased but it will keep monitoring indicators before deciding on raising interest rates. Still, the bank hinted at potential rate increases in the near future. The bank said rising borrowing costs in developed economies are worsening the global scenario for emerging markets, while failure to pass economic reform in Brazil is also tilting the balance of risks. Both factors could lead to more inflation, the bank said. The assessment came out in the minutes to last week's monetary policy meeting, when the Selic benchmark rate was held at 6.5% for the fourth consecutive meeting as inflation remains below target and the economy sputters.

Philippine Central Bank Official Indicates Rate Increase

The Philippine central bank will "show a strong hand" when it announces its next policy decision Thursday, its deputy governor said Tuesday as he indicated that its key interest rate is set to rise again. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of a meeting with U.K.-based investors, Diwa Guinigundo also said he expects global economic growth to slow, partly in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest-rate rises, which should in turn persuade the U.S. central bank to ease up on the pace of tightening. Mr. Guinigundo said an increase was likely on Thursday and the move may not mark the end of the recent series of rate increases.

Indonesia's Central Bank May Raise Interest Rates

Indonesia's central bank is expected to stay on track to raise interest rates further amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will most likely raise its interest rates Wednesday. 11 out of the 14 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predicted the central bank to raise borrowing costs when it meets on Thursday, with many citing preventing further outflow as the main factor.

FINANCIAL REGULATION ROUNDUP

SEC Moves to Kill Metric That Signaled Price Mismatch in Pot Fund

Wall Street's top regulator may soon get rid of a controversial metric for exchange-traded funds that just last week warned investors that a popular marijuana fund was trading at inflated prices. The measurement, known as intraday net asset value, gives investors a way to compare the price of a fund against the up-to-the-minute value of its underlying holdings. ETFs are required to report the information every 15 seconds during the trading day. The Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of an overhaul of the rules governing the $3.7 trillion U.S. ETF industry, has proposed eliminating that requirement. Instead, ETFs would have to report net asset value only once a day, at the closing bell. Comments on the proposed rule changes are due Oct. 1.

Shoppers Love Rewards Credit Cards. Retailers Hate Them

Consumers have become addicted to credit cards with generous rewards programs. Retailers are trying to cut them off. Large merchants including Amazon.com, Target and Home Depot are pushing for the right to reject some rewards credit cards, which typically carry higher fees for merchants. They are likely to opt out of a roughly $6.2 billion settlement Visa, Mastercard and several large banks recently reached with merchants and continue to make their case in court, according to people familiar with the matter. The retailers are trying to end the card networks' "honor all cards" rule, which requires merchants that accept Visa- or Mastercard-branded credit cards to take all of them.

Bankers vs. Activists: Battle Lines Form Over Low-Income Lending Rules

When Steven Mnuchin looked to sell his OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in 2014, a community group with an $800,000 budget tried to block the deal. That led to a nine-hour public hearing where speakers compared the bank's executives to the ebola virus and called for their imprisonment. Others voiced support. Four years later, Mr. Mnuchin is the Treasury secretary and his fellow executive at the bank, Joseph Otting, is now comptroller of the currency. And one of their big agenda items is an overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act, a law passed in 1977 to combat redlining, a practice where banks wouldn't lend in lower-income communities.

VoxEU Post Studies Central Bank Swap Lines

Swap lines between central banks in advanced economies have become a "significant part of the global financial architecture," Saleem Bahaj and Ricardo Reis write in a VoxEU column. They describe how such swap lines helped avert liquidity crises after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the financial crisis that started in 2007. Now, there are about 160 bilateral swap lines between central banks around the world, they write. The authors say the lines "perform a basic function of liquidity provision based around cooperation between central banks" and they "incentivize cross-border gross capital flows."

The Inevitable Sacrifice of Argentina's Central Banker

"Someone has to walk the plank when you want something big from the International Monetary Fund," Daniel Moss writes for Bloomberg Opinion. "That's been true of IMF loans, generally, to emerging markets. And Argentina is into something big with the Washington-based lender. The country is looking for a top-up of its $50 billion credit line, and if President Mauricio Macri can demonstrate the country can pay its debts, then the interest rates demanded by investors should come down from their crippling levels." Mr. Moss adds: "A leader that turns to the IMF has to have economic officials who can disavow the past practices and oversee the required reboot. And thus the exit of Argentine Central Bank President Luis Caputo, who resigned Tuesday after a mere three months in the role. He pulled rates as high as 60 percent to try to steady the peso. That's firefighting, not something sustainable…IMF or no, Macri had to change course. No economy can survive interest rates that stratospheric. Let's hope he hasn't forced the wrong person overboard."

The Fault Lies in R-Star and in Ourselves

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell should question the whole notion that r-star--or the neutral real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive--has any significant practical use for the central bank, writes Kevin Warsh for The Wall Street Journal. "In my view, r-star is not a beacon in the sky but a chimera in the eye," he writes. "The idea of a "neutral" rate is a useful fiction. It makes for an interesting academic thought experiment. In practice, though, it's unobservable, unpredictable, imprecise and highly variable. That makes it a poor guide for policy makers."

U.S. consumer confidence hit a new 18-year high in September, a positive indicator for spending going into the holiday shopping season, as robust job growth and a strong economic outlook bolstered Americans' expectations for the future.

U.S. home-price gains slowed for the fourth straight month in July, as higher mortgage rates begin acting as a brake on rapid price growth, offering some welcome respite for buyers.

An index measuring manufacturing activity across the central Atlantic region expanded in September. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a report its composite manufacturing index rose to 29 in September from 24 in August. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 20 in September.--Dow Jones Newswires

New Zealand business confidence jumped in September to its highest level since May, helping to ease what has become the biggest source of the worry for the economic outlook, and challenging the central bank's view that interest rates might soon need to be cut.

 HDFed poised to raise rates for third time this year   WC223 words   PD26 September 2018   ET10:49   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to raise interest rates for a third time this year and possibly modify the likely direction of rates in the months ahead.

The big question is whether the strong U.S. economy, which has been fueled this year by tax cuts and increased government spending, could weaken next year, especially if President Donald Trump's trade fights begin to inflict damage and the benefits of tax cuts start to fade.
   TDIf the Fed finds that prospect likely, it might signal Wednesday that it expects to slow its rate increases next year.

The Fed's key short-term rate now stands in a range of 1.75-2 percent after two quarter-point increases in March and June. A similar rate hike Wednesday would raise that range to a still-low 2-2.25 percent.

   LP0815 GMT - Emerging market currencies "are not out of the woods" even though a Federal Reserveinterest rate increase later on Wednesday is widely expected, says UniCredit. The simultaneous action of the Fed unwinding its balance sheet, coupled with increased U.S. Treasury issuance, "may still tighten global liquidity conditions in the months ahead and weigh on several EM currencies." However, if U.S. inflation were to come in below expectations on Friday, this "could provide some more support to EM." Most EM currencies are up against the dollar on Wednesday.

   TD0804 GMT - Singapore manufacturing activity will likely slow further in 4Q with downside pressures coming from escalations in US-China trade tensions, Maybank says as it expects the trade-dependent economy to cool in coming quarters. Combined with impacts from July's residential-property cooling measures on the service sector and the bank predicts 2.6% GDP growth for this quarter, versus 2Q's 3.9%. As such, Maybank doesn't see Singapore's central bank tightening further next month. (saurabh.chaturvedi@wsj.com; @journosaurabh)

0750 GMT - Italy's budget for 2019, to be presented on Thursday, "remains a key point of uncertainty" amid varied news on the size of deficit but a below 2% gap could give further support to Italian government bonds, says Societe Generale. "A sub 2% deficit may provide BTPs with further support but we continue to see significant uncertainties around passing the budget and [credit] ratings," say Societe Generale's rates strategists. Italian government bond prices have firmed in recent days, driving yields lower, on hopes that the country's government will present a market-friendly budget plan for next year. The 10-year BTP yield is trading at 2.86%, down one basis point, according to Factset. Yields move inversely to prices. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0727 GMT - The 10-year Italian BTP-German Bund yield spread should narrow toward 200-210 basis points if Italy's macro numbers for 2019 are as "constructive" as UniCredit expects, says rates strategist Chiara Cremonesi, referring to a budget deficit close to 2%. Italy's government is expected to present its budget draft for 2019 on Thursday. The 200-210 basis point spread is an initial target and the tightening could be even more pronounced "if some of the non-resident investors that sharply reduced their exposure to Italian government bonds in May and June returned, Ms. Cremonesi says. The spread is currently 235 basis points, according to FactSet. Investors with a more long-term strategy may wait rating reviews by Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings before extending their exposure to Italy, though, Ms. Cremonesi says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0721 GMT - Italy's funding outlook until year-end looks "smooth," says Chiara Cremonesi, rates strategist at UniCredit. She calculates that after Thursday's end-of-the-month government bond auction, Italy will have to issue around EUR35 billion in medium- and long-term debt until year's end. UniCredit expects Italy's average monthly issuance at EUR17 billion in October and November, down from a monthly average of EUR20 billion in the year to date, she says. UniCredit expects the Italian treasury to cancel the mid-December bond auction, in line with previous years. The analyst says net supply will be negative until the end of the year as issuance will be accompanied by EUR54 billion of redemptions in the October to December period. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0713 GMT - The U.S. Federal Reserve is largely expected to raise the interest rate by 25 basis points to a corridor of 2% to 2.25% on Wednesday, hence the flat EUR/USD at 1.1766 in London morning trading. The Fed's monetary policy tightening is likely to end next year, says UniCredit, which means "most of the dollar's strength is behind us." The Fed could remove the word "accommodative" from Wednesday's statement, but most analysts think this is unlikely. Even if it does, "we would not expect this change to trigger any strong dollar buying," UniCredit says. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com)

0658 GMT - Germany's 0% October 2023 Bobl offers value on the German yield curve, having underperformed on the October 2021-October 2023-August 2025 yield "fly" over the past month and also on the 2-5-10-year curve, say Citigroup's rates strategists. The German Finance Agency will tap the October 2023 Bobl on Wednesday with EUR3 billion on offer. The "fly" is at the cheapest level since the launch of the October 2023 Bobl in July, Citi's strategists say. They add that the five-year sector has also underperformed by some 11 basis points on the 2-5-10-year curve. Auction results are due at 0930 GMT. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0650 GMT - The recent volatility may make some investors cautious ahead of Germany's EUR3 billion tap of the October 2023 Bobl Wednesday, say Mizuho's rates strategists. In fact, they reckon, the fear of hawkish comments should keep outright investors away from the five-year maturity segment on the German yield curve until yields reach 0%. Volatility in the five-year maturity segment of the curve has been "material" around central bankers' comments this week, Mizuho's strategist say, adding that the October 2023 Bobl is also expensive on the April 2023-October 2023 Bobl roll. The auction bond is trading at a yield of -0.03%, according to Factset. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0649 GMT - There's more pain ahead for the Indian rupee as oil prices continue to rise. Fitch Solutions now expect it to hit INR74 against the dollar in 2019, up from its previous forecast of INR69. Despite recent government assurances, the local currency hasn't firmed much; it is at INR72.64. Oil accounts for almost a third of India's total import bill and Fitch expects India's plan to cut Iranian oil imports amid U.S. sanctions to make the bill bigger, and also weigh on its terms of trade. It also expects troubles in Turkey and Argentina to continue to fuel broader risk-off sentiment across emerging markets. Finally, a hawkish Fed will pressure the rupee further. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com )

0635 GMT - Germany's EUR3 billion tap of the October 2023 Bobl, a five-year federal note, "should be absorbed smoothly," despite the recent repricing in five-year bonds, say Commerzbank rates strategists. The small offer volume at the upcoming auction is a factor that could support demand but so is the fact that the bond may avoid further underperformance following the recent selloff in German bonds. "At yield levels close to 0%, further underperformance looks limited with the pool of traditional Bobl investors increasingly noticeable at positive yields," say Commerzbank's rates strategists. The Bobl is trading at a yield of minus 0.03%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

0622 GMT - Steady gains today left the Nikkei above 24000 for the 1st time since in 8 months as the index was able to overcome the impact from a number of companies' stock prices being adjusted lower amid looming dividend payments. The index finished at session highs in rising 0.4% to 24033.79; the ex-dividend impact was estimated at about 160 points and banks were among the underperformers for that reason. Some electronics and consumer-goods makers rose about 3% today despite continuing caution about US trade policies. Helping was the dollar briefly hitting a 2-month high and breaching Y113; it's now around Y112.90. Meanwhile, 10-year JGB yields remain at 0.125%. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com)

0618 GMT - The German 10-year Bund yield trades little changed early in the day as attention turns to the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision. As the Fed is almost universally expected to raise the funds target range by another 25 basis points, "attention will thus be focused on the forward guidance, including the new 'dot plot' diagram, to gain insight into the plans for 2019 and beyond," say ING rates strategists. Germany's EUR3 billion tap of the October 2023 Bobl will also draw attention as the recent selloff pushed five-year bond yields to multi-month highs. The 10-year Bund yield trades at 0.53%, according to FactSet. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

However, if U.S. inflation were to come in below expectations on Friday, this "could provide some more support to EM." Most EM currencies are up against the dollar on Wednesday.

 HDClouds on horizon as trade wars, debt weigh on Asia's growth   BYBy ELAINE KURTENBACH    CRAssociated Press   WC788 words   PD26 September 2018   ET06:02   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPBANGKOK (AP) — Trade conflicts, rising debt and the potential impact from rising interest rates in the U.S. will likely dampen growth in the coming year, the Asian Development Bank said Wednesday in an update of its regional economic outlook report.

The Manila, Philippines-based regional lender said Wednesday that it expects economic growth in Asia to remain at a robust 6.0 percent in 2018 but to slip to 5.8 percent next year.
   TDChina's economy is expected to expand at a 6.6 percent annual pace this year but slow to 6.3 percent in 2019.

It cited looming financial and trade shocks as the biggest sources of potential trouble. If the U.S. economy shows signs of overheating, interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, including one expected Wednesday to take the benchmark rate to 2-2.25 percent, could disrupt currency markets and other capital flows, leading to problems with bad loans.

Overly high housing prices also are risks for China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and South Korea, the report said.

But it said the bigger threat comes from potential damage to supply chains caused by trade conflicts, especially between the U.S. and China.

President Donald Trump pushed ahead Monday with higher tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated by imposing penalties on $60 billion of U.S. goods.

The conflict stemming from U.S. complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology, has the potential to shave 0.5 percentage points off of China's growth and 0.1 percentage points off of growth in the U.S., the report said.

China and the United States earlier imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of each other's goods. Combined, the tariffs now cover nearly half the goods and services China sells America and nearly 60 percent of what the United States sells China.

The damage will be worse if Trump carries out threats to raise tariffs on virtually all products imported from China, said the ADB's chief economist, Yasuyuki Sawada.

But fast-growing Asia is quickly becoming such a large market that expanding trade within the region can help offset lost exports to the U.S., he said.

"Intraregional trade in Asia is as high as almost 50 percent of total t rade and this seems to be increasing over time," he told The Associated Press in a phone interview. "Asia used to be a global factory and everyone viewed Asian economies as suppliers, but if we look, more than half of the global middle class is living in Asia."

Also, even if Trump's tariffs strategy succeeds in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, the ADB report said, the deficit with Asia overall is unlikely to decline so much because other countries would likely be exporting more to make up the difference.

Efforts to forge regional free trade agreements are gaining momentum partly thanks to the U.S. moves, Sawada said.

"It's encouraging and very important to keep this momentum toward a more open trading system," he said.

Still, the ADB report said that prolonged trade conflict would damage confidence and deter investment, both regional and globally, especially if it expands to include autos and auto trade.

"Estimates of impacts do not fully capture possible disruption to production units as overseas business networks are severed and investment plans are cancelled amid a reallocation of global production," it said.
