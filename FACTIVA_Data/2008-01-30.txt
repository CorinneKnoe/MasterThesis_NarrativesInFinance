   LPUncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve would continue on its path of aggressive interest rate cuts made for another nervous session in financial markets on Wednesday. 

Interest rate futures continued to price in a strong chance that the US central bank would sanction a further 50 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate at its policy meeting, following last week's unscheduled 75bp easing. 
   TDHowever, stronger-than-expected economic releases over the last few days have led some strategists to challenge whether cuts of such magnitude could be justified. 

Wednesday provided another mixed bag of US economic releases. 

A survey from ADP Employer Services showed that 130,000 private sector jobs were created in January, about three times the expected increase, heightening expectations that the crucial non-farm payrolls report, Due on Friday, could turn out to be stronger than expected. 

"ADP has proved itself horribly misleading several times over the past year but the fact remains that it is the best - or least bad, anyway - single advance indicator of payrolls," said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. 

However, US fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth came in much weaker than expected. 

The economy expanded at an annualised rate of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007 - the slowest pace for five years and down sharply from 4.9 per cent in the third quarter. 

Stephen Stanley, chief US economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, warned the fourth-quarter advance was "too close for comfort" given the normal scope of revisions to the initial estimate. 

He suggested that assumptions made by the Commerce Department for December trade and inventories data were far too optimistic. "Depending on how the surprises elsewhere break, the fourth-quarter GDP number could easily end up slightly below zero." 

Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak, took a more optimistic view, saying the GDP report showed that business inventories had been "extraordinarily well managed" during the economic slowdown, boding well for the future. 

"Inventories are so lean that any increase in spending will almost immediately translate into an increase in industrial output, which, when it occurs, will boost incomes and lead to conditions consistent with sustained economic expansion," he said. 

Equity markets eased back across the board. In Asia, an early attempt to build on Tuesday's gains came to nought as uncertainty about the Fed set in. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average ended 1 per cent lower, while Hong Kong shed 2.6 per cent and Seoul fell 3 per cent to a nine-month low. 

European stocks adopted a similarly cautious tone, with fresh writedowns at Swiss bank UBS further damping the mood. 

The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.7 per cent, although German stocks outperformed as the Xetra Dax shed 0.3 per cent. 

The Fed decision came after European markets had closed. 

By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were both 0.3 per cent lower. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent. 

Government bonds edged back in quiet trading ahead of the Fed's decision. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury increased 2 basis points at 3.69 per cent and the two-year yield was also 2bp higher at 2.31 per cent. 

In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was up 3bp at 4.01 per cent - although the 10-year Japanese government bond yield fell 4 bp to 1.43 per cent following the slide in Japanese equities. 

Currency markets were also becalmed, with the dollar showing little reaction to the day's US economic data. The euro briefly edged above $1.48 but was back below that level by midday in New York. 

Sterling edged back after some grim data on the UK housing market. 

In commodities, oil prices showed little reaction to news of a bigger than forecast increase in US crude inventories last week. 

March West Texas Intermediate consolidated below the $92 a barrel mark as the market awaited news from this week's Opec meeting. 

Gold and platinum prices went into retreat after Tuesday's record highs as power was restored to some mining operations in South Africa.

   LPPity the Federal Reserve. Given extreme uncertainty about the trajectory of the US economy, it is like a poker player in a hand with a big pot and every player still in: placing a monetary policy bet takes luck as much as judgment. A sound case can be made for the Fed's aggressive interest rate cuts of 125 basis points in eight days, although a sound case could also be made for a more gentle approach. 

The question is whether financial market troubles will create feedback loops in the economy. If falls in house prices increase credit losses at banks, which reduce mortgage lending and so create further drops in house prices, then a deflationary spiral could take hold. Equally, it might not. That uncertainty, and uncertainty about whether monetary policy will work at all given the parlous state of the banks, makes a sensible strategy hard to formulate. 
   TDThe Fed's decision to cut rates to 3 per cent suggests its concerns have become a great deal more serious. Even given the problems in the banking system, interest rates at this level are certain to stimulate the economy over time. At the very least, some subprime mortgages will not reset to such high rates as they might have done, while low Fed rates will also trigger demand for mortgage refinancing. 

The risk is that the economy recovers quickly, and today's monetary stimulation turns into rapid inflation in the future. So far, inflation expectations look to be under control, but that could change in the blink of a trading screen if the economy turns the corner. The Fed's poker game is for high stakes. 

The abandonment of a gradualist approach to changing interest rates - moving them up or down by 25bp every month for months - is sensible. Shocks to the economy are not evenly distributed or equal in size, and there is no reason why the monetary policy response should be either. If a central bank thinks rates of 3 per cent are appropriate, then it should move them there at once. 

The Fed should, however, avoid the kind of lurch in its thinking that produces a 125bp cut if at all possible. It implies that previous policy was wrong - and that risks creating a sense of panic. 

The Fed has more data than anyone on the state of the US economy, and, given the uncertainties, the only choice is to trust it to run the risks it judges necessary. Neither faith in the dollar nor in the Fed's inflation-fighting credentials have collapsed so far. But the US central bank must stand ready to raise interest rates as fast as it lowered them once the economy starts to recover.

 CLMCAPITAL   HDTone Is Calmer Off Wall Street      BYBy David Wessel      WC774 words   PD31 January 2008   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA2   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   
   LPTalk to folks on Wall Street, and you sense panic. This could be the Big One, a deep recession of the sort last seen when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker was raising interest rates to break the back of inflation 25 years ago.   

Yet wander away from the nation's money center, and the tone is different. Optimism is scarce, for sure. Ordinary workers and voters, many of whose paychecks haven't been keeping up with inflation, are bummed and anxious. But the tone of conversation among many executives in Main Street businesses (outside of housing) is worried, not gloomy -- and certainly not panicked.   
   TD"The further you get from Wall Street, the better things look," says economist Mark Vitner, who works at the Charlotte, N.C., headquarters of  Wachovia Corp. His bank sees a painfully slow -- but recession-free -- economy, growing at a 1% annual pace for the first half, followed by a surge of 2.5% or better growth in the second half as the oomph from fiscal stimulus and recent Fed interest-rate cuts is felt.   

The other day, analysts asked Greg Hayes,  United Technologies Corp.'s vice president for finance, if the big manufacturer has seen any deterioration in the aerospace, building and other markets to which it sells. "We really have not," he replied, according to a Thomson Financial transcript of the call. "And believe me, we're asking that question every week . . . as we read the headlines. I think everyone is concerned that there is a slowdown out there. We have not seen it."   

At  Verizon Communications Inc., President Denny Strigl struck a similar note, professing to "remain very confident about 2008 despite all of the noise we are hearing about the economy.   

What gives? Are Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the White House and Congress overreacting?   

It is worse on Wall Street. Losses are massive, risk-management models have been shredded and chief executives have been replaced. "This a credit-market shock, and Wall Street is in the eye of the storm," says Laurence Meyer, a forecaster and former Fed governor who is more optimistic than many others. "It's what makes this different."   

It is easier to be upbeat if one is the CEO of a company that does a big chunk of its business overseas.  United Technologies got 62% of its revenue from abroad last year. Similarly at  Caterpillar Inc., Chief Executive Jim Owens is chipper about the equipment maker's outlook because he is counting on continued strength abroad to offset the recession the company anticipates in the U.S. More than 55% of  Caterpillar's sales come from outside North America. It expects world-wide revenue to grow 5% to 10% this year even though U.S. revenue will be somewhere between flat and up 5%.   

And less-pessimistic forecasters and executives are impressed by the speed with which the government is flexing its recession-resisting muscles. President Bush and the leaders of Congress are moving surprisingly swiftly on fiscal stimulus, and the Fed is now cutting rates aggressively. With yesterday's move, it has lowered rates by 2.25 percentage points since August.   

Says Richard Berner of  Morgan Stanley: "The combination of aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus makes us more confident in our call for a mild recession." By this fall, he says, the economy may be growing at a comfortable 3% pace or better.   

Number-crunching forecasters argue, correctly, that new-home construction, the major drag on economic growth, can't keep declining indefinitely. To reduce growth in gross domestic product as much as it did in 2007, housing starts -- down 38% in the past year -- would need to fall another 24% this year, says  Wells Capital Management's James Paulsen. "Not likely in our book," he says.   

Let's hope so. But Wall Street might yet prove to be right. Maybe the tidal wave hasn't reached Main Street yet, but that doesn't mean it won't.   

The central issue is how much worse the credit crunch will get. "It has spread much further than anybody expected," Mr. Meyer says, and its eventual impact on consumers and businesses is hard for a model-tending forecaster to quantify. Hence all the talk about downside risk. As Mr. Meyer puts it, "The 'downside risk' is calibrating all those things we cannot measure."   

Or, as another economist once put it: "Extreme disruptions of the normal functioning of financial markets seem often to have a significant impact on the real economy." That would be Ben Bernanke.

     SINGAPORE, Jan. 30 (MNI) - The US dollar remained narrowly mixed as 
the Asian morning ended, reflecting the overnight trend, as anticipation 
of tonight's Federal Reserve policy move kept nervous investors on the 
sidelines. 

     Overnight, US durable goods orders and consumer confidence data 
provided the dollar with some support though debate over how much the US 
Federal Open Market Committee is likely to cut interest rates tonight 
remained at the forefront of market chatter. 

     "The stronger than expected data led to some paring back in 
expectations for forthcoming heavy handed interest rate cuts and the US 
Fed fund futures probability of a 50 bps cut slipped as low as 60% from 
86% on Monday," noted analysts at  United Overseas Bank. 

     That uncertainty persisted in Asia this morning, although stock 
markets in the region were generally mixed as investors marked time 
ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later today. 

     Japan's Nikkei 225 ended the morning session up 0.1% at 13,494 
after swinging between positive and negative territory. The Hang Seng 
rose about 1% to 24,521 in early trade and the Shanghai Composite was up 
1.9% at 4,540.33. 

     "Futures markets show the Fed will cut 50 bps tonight, but we feel 
there is strong possibility that it may ease by just 25 bps for fear of 
promoting fear about the state of the US economy," LGT Asia analysts 
said in a daily note. 

     In forex markets, currency pairs remained locked in narrow ranges, 
with most players content to allow carry trade flows to influence 
direction before tonight's Fed decision. 

     Dollar-yen came off an early Y107.18 high at the start of the day, 
and slipped below Y107.00 to hit bottom at Y106.70. That tracked a 
retreat in euro-yen, the cross sliding to a Y157.60 low after an early 
Y158.31 high. 

     Dollar-yen bounced just before midday here as euro-yen also 
rebounded, to Y106.80 and Y157.79, respectively. 

     Euro-dollar meanwhile, witnessed an early dip, also in tune with 
euro-yen's initial decline, the former marking a low at $1.4660 against 
an earlier high of $1.4680. 

     Euro-dollar has since also rebounded, albeit modestly, to trade at 
$1.4771 before midday.

By Rebecca Christie

     WASHINGTON (MNI) - Wall Street welcomed the Federal Reserve's new 
emphasis on fighting off a recession, ushered in Wednesday with a 
half-point rate cut and new language on downside risks facing the 
economy. 

     "They finally went to an easing bias, which was nice," said  Lehman 
Brothers economist Drew Matus. "The next move is probably not going to 
be up." 

     The Fed's short-term interest rate target now stands at 3% after 
Wednesday's 0.5-point cut, which came on the heels of a 0.75-point 
intermeeting cut last week. The Federal Open Market Committee also noted 
that "financial markets remain under considerable stress" and cited 
downside risks to growth. 

     This approach contrasts with the Fed's stance last year, when 
policymakers said they worried about inflation risks as well as the 
slumping economy. Inflation has been running higher than Fed officials 
would like, but Wednesday's statement said the FOMC expected price 
pressures to moderate over the course of the year. 

     The Fed moved to cut rates on a 9-1 vote, with dissent from Dallas 
Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher. He recommended no change 
in interest rates, in keeping with his recent reputation as an inflation 
hawk. But no other FOMC voters joined him, not even Philadelphia Federal 
Reserve Bank president Charles Plosser, who has also been vocal in 
expressing inflation concerns. Economists said that means inflation 
worries aren't likely to dominate the near-term policy debate. 

     That means the Fed will keep watching inflation developments, but 
for now economic weakness takes top priority, said Neal Soss, head of 
U.S. economics for  Credit Suisse. "When all is said and done, it isn't 
really in the first instance about the economy. It's about the shock 
from the financial system to the economy. The risks to the economy are 
to the downside, no matter what the outcome," Soss said. 

     Wednesday's statement lays the groundwork for more rate cuts while 
also suggesting that the pace of easing will slow going forward, Soss 
said. Wall Street is split on how far the Fed will go before it halts 
its easing campaign. In interviews with Market News, economists said 
they expected the Fed to bring its federal funds rate target down to at 
least 2.5%. 

     "That is contingent on the credit crunch remaining of manageable 
proportions for small and medium businesses. If it does not, theyll 
have to go lower," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist of High 
Frequency Economics. 

     Lehman's Matus predicts the Fed will go further, moving down in 
stages to reach 2%. But he also thinks the U.S. economy may be able to 
fend off its current troubles, saying the odds of an all-out recession 
currently stand at just 40%.

--Retransmitting Story Published 14:48 ET Monday 

By Steven K. Beckner

     Market News International - Just a week after slashing short-term 
interest rates aggressively, the Federal Reserve's policymaking Federal 
Open Market Committee convenes two days of meetings Tuesday which are 
widely expected to culminate in another rate cut. 

     The great majority of Fed watchers are looking for another 50 basis 
point cut in the federal funds rate to 3% when the Fed makes it rate 
announcement Wednesday afternoon, with a matching cut in the discount 
rate. 

     A forceful easing bias was inferred from the FOMC's Jan. 22 rate 
announcement, which said, "Appreciable downside risks to growth remain.  
The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as 
needed to address those risks." 

     Together with the 75 basis point rate cut announced last Tuesday 
morning, an additional 50 basis point reduction would mean the FOMC will 
have engaged in a massive 125 basis points of easing within little more 
than a week. 

     It would be virtually unprecedented, at least in proportional 
terms. In 1982, the funds rate dropped 247 basis points from July to 
August, but from a much higher level -- 12.59%. That represented a 19.6% 
decline in the funds rate. The amount of easing now being contemplated 
would mean a 29.4% reduction. 

     Some were speculating last week that the FOMC might do less easing, 
on the premise that it did not know about the role Societe Generale's 
fraud-related losses played in last Monday's global stock market 
sell-off when it voted Monday evening to make its intermeeting rate cut 
the following morning. 

     But a Fed source told MNI that, from the Fed's perspective, last 
Monday's market turmoil had relatively little to do with SocGen and 
that, therefore, SocGen's problems would have had little influence on 
the FOMC's decision if they had been known at the time. 

     The source said that, since the Fed became apprised of the SocGen 
scandal, policymakers have not changed their minds about the merits of 
the emergency rate cut. 

     Market turbulence has continued, although there have been mixed 
signs of improved in credit conditions. 

     And, as if they needed any reminders about the weakness of the 
housing market, the Commerce Department reported Monday morning that new 
home sales fell a greater than expected 4.7% in December and that the 
median home price plunged by 10.9%. 

     Tomorrow's durable goods orders will gauge the strength of demand 
for manufactured products, while the Conference Board measures consumer 
confidence. As they convene Wednesday, Fed policymakers will get an 
advance look at fourth quarter gross domestic product. It is expected to 
show a sharp slowing of growth. 

     The FOMC can only anticipate with dread what other key numbers 
might show after its meetings. Thursday will bring personal income and 
spending numbers, as well as a key inflation index. Most anxiously 
awaited are Friday's January employment report and purchasing managers 
survey results. 

     The FOMC which votes on Wednesday will have a different composition 
than the one which approved last week's rate cut. The voting Federal 
Reserve Bank Presidents will be Cleveland's Sandra Pianalto, 
Philadelphia's Charles Plosser, Dallas's Richard Fisher and 
Minneapolis's Gary Stern. 

     Those four might be considered marginally more "hawkish" as a group 
than the presidents they replaced -- Chicago's Charles Evans; Kansas 
City's Hoenig; St. Louis' William Poole and Boston's Eric Rosengren. But 
it is doubtful whether the outcome of the meeting will be greatly 
affected by the change in the voting ranks. 

     The same considerations apply regardless of the composition of the 
committee. 

     Chiefly, Bernanke and company must decide how much more recession 
"insurance" they need to buy? How much additional monetary accommodation 
do they need to put in place? 

     And just where does the easing process end? That is going to be a 
very difficult question to answer. The FOMC will undoubtedly be feeling 
its way along in coming weeks and months -- doing more if the incoming 
data run at odds to its forecast, eventually reversing rate cuts if and 
when markets stabilize and the economy regains traction. 

     If the FOMC is going to "front load" more easing, former head of 
the Fed's Divison of Monetary Affairs Vincent Reinhart warned last week 
that it is going to "have to have the willingness and the fortitude to 
say, 'we've done it" -- to say "no" to further easing out of recognition 
that easing will only take effect with unpredictable lags. 

     In the back of Fed officials' minds will be the issue of how much 
ammunition they have spent and how much remains to be spent. At the rate 
they have been lowering rates, they could run out of room to affect the 
economy. 

     In June 2003, the FOMC cut the funds rate to a barebone 1%, in 
large part out of an excess of caution against deflation risks, but no 
one wants to revisit those levels if it can be helped. 

     Because of such considerations, a 50 basis point rate cut is not a 
foregone conclusion. Certainly some will argue for a smaller move. 

     Far from deflation, some FOMC members are sure to warn about the 
potential inflationary consequences of continued easing, and the foreign 
exchange markets may well render another unfavorable judgment on the 
value of the dollar as interest rate differentials move against the 
greenback. 

     In recognition of the inflation risks they are taking, the FOMC 
will, in all likelihood, reiterate its intention to "monitor inflation 
developments carefully." 

     But in the final analysis, rightly or wrongly, inflation has been 
put on the backburner for the time being. Even Poole, who dissented 
against last week's rate cut out of a desire to wait for this week's 
regularly scheduled meeting, said "solidly entrenched" inflation 
expectations give the Fed "breathing room" for "substantial easing." 

     As for the dollar, the Fed has seldom let exchange rates guide 
policy, especially when there are other overriding considerations -- 
namely keeping the economy out of a downturn that would injure the 
public welfare and the Fed's own image. 

     Aside from setting rates, the FOMC has the unenviable task of 
compiling its quarterly economic forecast. For just the second time, the 
FOMC will be making extended, three-year forecasts of GDP growth, 
inflation and unemployment and providing assessments of risks to the 
outlook. 

     The forecasts, which will be released when Fed Chairman Ben 
Bernanke makes his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress in 
late February, are sure to be considerably less optimistic than those 
developed at the October 30-31 FOMC meeting. 

     The central forecast of Fed governors and Federal Reserve Bank 
Presidents was for 2008 real GDP growth in a range of 1.8% to 2.5%, 
compared to 2.4-2.5% for 2007. Growth was projected to improved to 
2.3-2.7% in 2009 and to 2.5-2.6% in 2010. 

     The unemployment rate was projected at 4.8% to 4.9%  for 2008, 
compared to 4.7% to 4.8% for 2007. The projections for 2009 and 2010 
were 4.8-4.9% and 4.7-4.9%. 

     Core PCE inflation, forecast at 1.8-1.9% in 2007, was projected at 
1.7-1.9% for 2008 and 2009, before edging a tad lower to 1.6-1.9% in 
2010. 

     Although no one at the Fed has predicted a recession, Bernanke and 
his colleagues have acknowledged an increase in downside risks, so it 
will be difficult for the central tendency forecasts not to reflect 
those diminished expectations.

 HDASIA FX: US Dollar Mixed Early After Fed Slashes Key Rates      WC434 words   PD31 January 2008   ET00:47   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.

     SYDNEY, Jan. 31 (MNI) -  The US dollar was mixed against major 
currencies Thursday after falling overnight following the Federal 
Reserve's expected decision to slash its key interest rate by 50 basis 
points. 

     The aggressive interest rate cut and hints of more to come 
triggered a brief rally on Wall Street and reignited the market's 
appetite for risky, high-yielding currencies such as the Australian and 
New Zealand dollar against the low-yielding yen and US dollar. 

     At 9.50 a.m. here (2250 GMT), the US dollar was trading at Y106.17 
against the yen compared with Y106.50 in late New York trade. 

     The euro, meanwhile, was down at $1.4853 to the dollar, versus 
$1.4881 overnight while sterling was trading at $1.9882 after rising to 
$1.9907. 

     "The dovish FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) statement pushed 
short-term US yields lower and the Fed funds futures are now pricing in 
a 100% chance of a 25 basis points ease at the March 18 meeting and a 
52% chance of a 50 basis point cut at that meeting," said John Noonan, 
an analyst at Thomson IFR. 

     Elsewhere, the commodities-backed Australian dollar was trading at 
$0.8896 after advancing to $0.8969 overnight on the Fed's decision to 
reduce the federal funds rate target to 3.0%.  

     But NAB Capital head of currency strategy John Kyriakopoulos urged 
investors to be cautious about building large positions in the Aussie, 
noting the US economy could still slip into recession and take the rest 
of the world with it. 

     A global economic downturn could reduce demand for commodities, 
which would have a negative impact on the Australian dollar. 

     "We remain skeptical that the Fed's aggressive interest rate cuts 
mean that the all clear can be sounded on US recession risks and a sharp 
global downturn. As such, we are wary of getting bullish on the 
Australian dollar," said Kyriakopoulos. 

     These fears seemed to be confirmed by data released Wednesday 
showing the US economy almost ground to a halt in the fourth quarter, 
with annualized gross domestic product growing just 0.6%, half the 
market's consensus forecast.

*    [JGBs End Mixed] Japanese government bonds ended Thursday's session 
narrowly mixed, with longer-dated paper underperforming despite 
month-end duration demand.  Ten-year and shorter paper saw yields 
unchanged to narrowly lower, helped by the Fed's overnight rate cut and 
the subsequent bounce in the Treasury market. However, gains were capped 
by rallying stocks in afternoon trade. There was little market reaction 
to the 2-year auction, with sluggish demand seen from investors.
The benchmark 10-year yield was 0.25 bps higher at 1.440%, while the  
lead Mar JGB futures contract was 0.05 lower at 137.75. 

*    [Sluggish Demand At Japan 2-Year Auction] A price competitive 
auction for Y1.7 trillion of the 0.5% coupon 2-year #265 Japanese 
Government Bonds by the Ministry of Finance produced a lowest accepted 
price of 99.905 to yield 0.548%, with 82.85% of bids at that level 
accepted, the ministry said Thursday. The bid/cover ratio was 2.89.

*    [Japan Stocks End Higher, Helped By Fed Cut] Japanese stock indices 
ended the day higher, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 higher by 247.44 
points, or 1.85%, at 13592.47. The broader-based TOPIX was 26.20 points 
higher at 1346.31.

*    [Greenback Mixed In Asian Trade] The dollar was mixed in Asia, 
weaker against the euro but bouncing back from weakness against the yen. 
Dollar-yen rallied early to touch a high at Y106.65, before intraday 
sellers sent the pair at a low at Y106.05 as stops were triggered at 
Y106.40. The pair bounced of the lows, as bids at Y106.00 again provided 
support. The pair settled around Y106.40 for much of the afternoon 
session. Euro-dollar traded a $1.4820/83 range in Asia, holding towards 
the session highs late in the day.

*    [BOJ Nishimura: Bank To Keep Gradual Rate Hike Policy] Bank of 
Japan policy board member Kiyohiko Nishimura repeats the bank's mantra 
that it will keep its flexible gradual rate hike policy and says there 
is a low probability that the risks to the bank's outlook will become 
reality. In a speech, he also says that downside risks to growth are 
growing but that the U.S. economy is likely to return to its potential 
growth rate and that Japan's growth mechanism is intact.

*    [Japan Construction Orders Up In Dec] The value of construction 
orders received in December by the 50 largest contractors in Japan rose 
4.7% year-on-year to Y1.23 trillion, up for the first time in six 
months, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said 
Thursday. The December rebound followed a small 3.8% decline in 
November, a 22.7% plunge in October, a 16.3% decline in September, a 
14.2% fall in August and a 10.4% drop in July. 

*    [Japan Avg Cash Earnings Slip In Dec] The average monthly cash 
earnings per regular employee in Japan, including overtime and bonuses, 
was at Y596,895 in December, down 1.9% from a year earlier, falling for 
the first time in two months, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare 
said Thursday. It followed a revised 0.1% rise in November. 

*    [HKMA Cuts Base Rate] The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said 
it had cut the base rate for its discount window by 50 basis points to 
4.5%, following a similar cut overnight in the US federal funds rate. 
The HKMA generally follows the Fed's interest rate adjustments as Hong 
Kong's currency is pegged to the US dollar. The HKMA base rate is the 
reference rate for lending overnight funds to local banks. 

*    [Aussie Private Credit Provision Up In Dec] Credit provided to the 
Australian private sector by financial intermediaries rose 1.1% in 
December from November and increased 16.5% from a year ago, the Reserve 
Bank of Australia said Thursday. The market's consensus forecast was for 
a 1.2% increase from the previous month. In November, private sector 
credit grew 1.7% after rising 0.9% in October. 

[In The US]

*    Federal Reserve policymakers cut interest rates again Wednesday, 
as expected, and they left the door open to further credit easing moves 
to provide additional insurance against recession. The Fed's 
rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal funds rate, 
at which banks borrow from each other overnight, by 50 basis points to 
3.0%. The Fed Board of Governors cut the discount rate, at which banks 
borrow from the Fed, a like amount to 3.5% on requests from nine of 12 
Federal Reserve Banks. 

*    After the Federal Open Market Committee announcement Wednesday, 
prices of Federal Fund futures reflected small odds of a 25 bps 
intermeeting ease in February but also very solid odds of a total of 50 
basis points worth of easing by the April 30 monetary policy meeting, 
observers said. After the Fed lowered the Fed funds target by 50 bps to 
3.00%, the Treasury, eurodollar and Fed funds curves steepened 
dramatically and resulted in the February Fed funds contract pricing in 
approximately a 18% chance of an intermeeting 25 bps cut during the 
month. 

*    Wall Street welcomed the Federal Reserve's new emphasis on 
fighting off a recession, ushered in Wednesday with a half-point rate 
cut and new language on downside risks facing the economy. 

*    The U.S. economy is undergoing a significant housing correction, 
which together with high energy prices and the turmoil in the capital 
markets, caused "economic growth to slow rather markedly at the end of 
2007," U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Wednesday. This slow 
growth is reflected in GDP numbers released Tuesday morning, Paulson 
said, in a speech before The Real Estate Roundtable's State of the 
Industry meeting. 

*    U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs David H. 
McCormick praised China for the economic reforms made thus far, 
including recent stepped up yuan appreciation, but stressed the need for 
"more rapid, deeper" reform. McCormick, in a speech to the Council on 
Foreign Relations in New York Wednesday, made it clear however, that the 
U.S. is "making steady progress and bringing clear benefits to America's 
workers, businesses and consumers." 

*    The Treasury Department's February mid-quarter refunding of $22 
billion will pay down $32.458 billion, Treasury announced Wednesday. For 
February, the Treasury Department said it will sell $13.0 billion in 
10-year notes on Feb. 6 and $9 billion in 30-year bonds on Feb. 7. 
Settlement for these issues is Feb. 15. 

*    U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House Financial 
Services Committee, Wednesday apologized for his recent quip that a 
Democratic president might want to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Ben 
Bernanke when his term expires in 2010. 

*    U.S. GDP rose only 0.6% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in 
the fourth quarter, a much slower pace than the 4.9% gain in the 
previous quarter reflecting slower growth virtually across the board, 
the Commerce Department's advance estimate released Wednesday showed. 
The chain price index rose 2.6% in the fourth quarter after a 1.0% rise 
in the third quarter, Commerce reported. At the same time, the 
closely-watched core PCE price index rose 2.7% in the quarter, a faster 
pace than the 2.0% gain in the previous quarter.  

*    Top economic officials in Mexico Wednesday slashed the official 
2008 growth estimates, as expected, due to the impact of the slowing 
U.S. economy, but they also cited factors that will offset the decline 
and prevent it from being as dramatic as in past downturns. Deputy 
Finance Minister Alejandro Werner said the Finance Ministry had revised 
its GDP forecast to 2.8% from 3.7%.

 HD Federal Reserve 's fourth auction of short-term loans sees  interest rate  drop to 3.123 percent      BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER      CRAP Economics Writer   WC493 words   PD29 January 2008   ET16:08   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve, working to combat effects of a serious credit crisis, said Tuesday it had auctioned $30 billion (euro20.3 billion) in funds to commercial banks at an interest rate of 3.123 percent.   

It marked the fourth in a series of innovative auctions the Fed began last month in an effort to provide cash-strapped banks with extra reserves. The Fed's hope is that the increased resources will keep banks lending and prevent a severe credit squeeze from pushing the country into a recession.   
   TDThe latest auction results indicated that the Fed's program is having success. The 3.123 percent interest rate for the $30 billion (euro20.3 billion) in short-term loans marked the lowest rate of any of the four actions. The previous auction resulted in a rate of 3.95 percent and the first two saw rates at 4.65 percent and 4.67 percent.   

Bids for the current auction were received on Monday. The sharp drop in rates had been expected. Analysts said it reflected the fact that the central bank cut a key interest rate last week by three-fourths of a percentage point, the biggest reduction in more than two decades.   

That signaled that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues intend to move aggressively in an effort to prevent a steep slide in housing and the severe credit crunch from pushing the country into a recession.   

The Fed's rate cut last week represented the first emergency move between meetings since September 2001. Fed officials are meeting again Tuesday and Wednesday and financial markets are expecting that another rate cut, probably by a half-point, will be announced at the end of those discussions.   

Bernanke has said that the current auction process will continue for as long as needed to make sure that banks have sufficient reserves. He said the auctions might become a permanent addition to the Fed's "tool box" of strategies it can employ when credit markets have seized up.   

But he said before that occurs, the Fed would seek comments from the public on how the auctions should be designed so that they can be best used by financial institutions.   

The Fed went to the auction process in December after it had had only limited success in encouraging banks to use its "discount window" where the Fed makes direct loans to commercial banks. Banks had been reluctant to use the discount window out of concern they would be perceived as having trouble raising money through other avenues.   

The Fed on Friday will announce the schedule and amounts for upcoming auctions. The first two auctions in December made $20 billion (euro13.5 billion) in short-term loans available and the two January auctions each provided $30 billion (euro20.3 billion) in loans.

   LPExpectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve underpinned global equity markets yesterday and helped drive the price of gold to a record high. 

However, the mood among investors remained very nervous amid persistent concerns that the US economy might be slipping towards recession. 
   TDThe US central bank is widely expected to follow up last week's unscheduled 75 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate with a further 50bp cut to 3 per cent today. "With no immediate relief in sight for problems surrounding the financial sector and more slowing ahead in economic data throughout the first half, the Federal Open Market Committee is now expected to take full insurance against a recession," said Peter Possing Andersen, analyst at Danske Bank.

"This involves a real policy rate at close to zero, corresponding to a Fed funds rate in the 2-2 1/2 per cent range. Hence, we expect the FOMC will ease to a terminal rate of 2 per cent by June." 

However, data releases yesterday offered some hope that the US economy might be in better shape than many had feared. 

Durable goods orders rocketed 5.2 per cent in December - the biggest increase in five months - with ex-transportation orders up 2.6 per cent. But some economists noted a worrying build-up in inventories. 

Zach Pandl, economist at Lehman Brothers, noted the volatile nature of the data and said large increases must be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the strength in the report does suggest that demand for capital goods has not collapsed, despite tighter financing conditions," he said. 

US consumer confidence fell in January, but was not as weak as expected. Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, noted that the breakdown of the report was encouraging. "This is not the kind of data recessions are made of." 

But the outlook for the housing market remained unremittingly bleak, as the latest S&P/Case-Shiller report on home prices showed declines in all 20 major metropolitan areas in November. 

The 20-city composite index fell 7.7 per cent year-over-year - its eleventh successive monthly decline. 

Interest rate futures reacted to the day's data by moving to price in a 68 per cent chance of a 50 basis point cut from the Fed, down from 86 per cent on Monday. 

Equity markets enjoyed a bullish session. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 47.23 or 0.38 per cent to 12431.12, the S&P 500 was 3.21 or 0.24 per cent higher at 1357.17 but the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.59 or 0.15 per cent at 2346.39. Further support came from some better-than-expected earnings reports. 

In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.6 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London climbed 1.7 per cent. 

Asian markets were in even better form, with the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rising 3 per cent, Hong Kong gaining 1 per cent and Taipei 1.2 per cent. Shanghai's composite index bounced 0.9 per cent after Monday's 7.2 per cent tumble. 

Government bonds continued to retreat in line with the firmer tone of equity markets. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was up 7 basis points to 3.65 per cent, while the two-year yield climbed 9bp to 2.29 per cent. 

In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was 3bp higher at 3.98 per cent, while the 10-year Japanese government bond yield jumped 7bp to 1.475 per cent. 

In the currency markets , the dollar got a modest lift against the euro and the Swiss franc from the durable goods data, although activity was muted ahead of the Fed decision. 

Sterling was supported by a Confederation of British Industry report that indicated UK retail sales this month had held up relatively well - suggesting the Bank of England might not cut interest rates as aggressively as had been previously thought. 

The focus in commodities markets remained on precious metals as gold and platinum set fresh record highs. Gold peaked at Dollars 933.10 an ounce and platinum touched Dollars 1,735 as a power supply crisis in South Africa kept alive uncertainty about supplies of both metals. 

Oil prices were little changed ahead of this week's Opec meeting in Vienna. March West Texas Intermediate was just 14 cents lower at Dollars 90.85 a barrel.

Please disregard previous Asia FX, an old story repeated in error. The 
correct story folows:

     SINGAPORE, Jan. 31 (MNI) - The US dollar traded with slight losses 
through the Asian morning but held on to meager gains on the euro, 
guided largely by fluctuations in yen cross rates after the Federal 
Reserve's decision to slash interest rates overnight. 

     The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut the 
federal funds rate, at which banks borrow from each other overnight, by 
50 basis points to 3.0%. The Fed Board of Governors cut the discount 
rate, at which banks borrow from the Fed, a like amount to 3.5% on 
requests from nine of 12 Federal Reserve Banks.

     "The general tone of the accompanying January 29-30 statement 
essentially maintains the inclination for policy to ease further at 
subsequent meetings, though with some emerging sense of resistance among 
Reserve Bank Presidents," commented  United Overseas Bank economist 
Thomas Lam. 

     "Evidently, the futures market overnight has also priced-in roughly 
equal odds for an additional 25bps or 50bps reduction at the next 
meeting on March 18." 

     The aggressive interest rate cut and hints of more to come 
triggered a brief rally on Wall Street and reignited the market's 
appetite for risky, high-yielding currencies such as the Australian and 
New Zealand dollar against the low-yielding yen and US dollar.

     Dealers said fears about the health of the US economy persisted 
despite the Fed's actions, and these were compounded by data overnight 
showing the growth of the US economy almost ground to a halt in the 
fourth quarter, with annualized gross domestic product growing just 
0.6%, half the market's consensus forecast. 

     But dealers said although the outlook for the dollar remains 
generally soft, there has been some relief given the way the dollar has 
been tracking movements in yen crosses like euro-yen. 

     This morning, dollar-yen opened at Y106.27 in Asia, after seeing 
some wild swings overnight in New York, where it carved out a Y106.18 to 
Y107.47 range. 

     The pair retreated to Y106.04 in the early hours of trade but 
rebounded to a high of Y106.66, before again easing back to the middle 
of its morning range, around Y106.30.

     Tech analysts at trendsetterfx.com stated that dollar-yen's retreat 
suggests, "the decline from Y107.90 has resumed and below Y106.00 would 
extend weakness towards Y105.60/65 but oversold conditions should keep 
price above last week's Y104.95 low."  

     That reflected the moves in euro-yen with the cross traversing a 
Y157.26 to Y158.34 range this morning, before settling in midrange, 
around Y157.80.

     The softer euro-yen tone, compared with last night's close near 
Y158.60, prompted a weaker euro-dollar trend this morning, the latter 
coming off a $1.4863 high to $1.4818 before stabilizing at $1.4830 to 
$1.4850.

 HDASIA FX: US Dollar Ends Broadly Lower, Euro Sees Late Gains      WC780 words   PD31 January 2008   ET08:23   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.

     SINGAPORE, Jan. 31 (MNI) - The US dollar ended broadly weaker in 
Asia, erasing early gains on the euro after the single currency staged a 
late rally, with moves guided largely by fluctuations in yen crosses 
after the Federal Reserve's decision to slash interest rates overnight. 

     The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut the 
federal funds rate, at which banks borrow from each other overnight, by 
50 basis points to 3.0%. The Fed Board of Governors cut the discount 
rate, at which banks borrow from the Fed, a like amount to 3.5% on 
requests from nine of 12 Federal Reserve Banks. 

     "The general tone of the accompanying January 29-30 statement 
essentially maintains the inclination for policy to ease further at 
subsequent meetings, though with some emerging sense of resistance among 
Reserve Bank Presidents," commented  United Overseas Bank economist 
Thomas Lam. 

     "Evidently, the futures market overnight has also priced-in roughly 
equal odds for an additional 25bps or 50bps reduction at the next 
meeting on March 18." 

     Dealers said fears about the health of the US economy persisted 
despite the Fed's actions, and these were compounded by data overnight 
showing the growth of the US economy almost ground to a halt in the 
fourth quarter, with annualized gross domestic product growing just 
0.6%, half the market's consensus forecast. 

     But dealers said that while the outlook for the dollar remains 
generally soft, there has been some relief given the way the dollar has 
been tracking movements in yen crosses like euro-yen. 

     This morning, dollar-yen opened at Y106.27 in Asia and retreated to 
Y106.04 in the early hours of trade but rebounded to a high of Y106.66, 
before again easing back to the middle of its morning range, around 
Y106.30. 

     Through the afternoon, dollar-yen stayed in a narrow range between 
Y106.33 and Y106.63, to end the day around Y106.44, barely changed from 
where it was at midday but down from Y106.57 near the New York close 
overnight. 

     That reflected the moves in euro-yen with the cross traversing a 
Y157.26 to Y158.34 range this morning, before settling in midrange, at 
around Y157.80 by the midday break. 

     In late dealings, euro-yen edged higher, regaining a hold on 
Y158.00, before marking a fresh Asian session high of Y158.74. 

     The rebound in euro-yen, compared with last night's close near 
Y158.60, pulled euro-dollar off its weak morning trend and lifted it to 
an intraday high of $1.4909. 

     Euro-dollar began the day near $1.4874 but deflated to $1.4818 in 
the morning before stabilizing at $1.4830 to $1.4850. Dealers said the 
strong afternoon performance suggested further euro-dollar gains could 
be seen depending on how US markets fare today. 

     Currently, the European Central Bank's minimum refi rate is 4.0%, 
which gives the euro-zone a one percent yield advantage the US had held 
in 2005, the last time the fed funds rate stood at 3.0%. 

     "While the Fed's latest move puts the dollar at a tough-to-ignore 
interest rate disadvantage, we continue to see the dollar strengthening 
versus the euro in the medium-term, particularly as the ECB shifts its 
stance to follow suit," noted  UBS analysts. 
     
     With the Fed decision now past, attention is currently on the 
release of non-farm payrolls data for December, due out tomorrow, 
dealers said. 

     The median estimate in a Market News International survey of 
economists looks for non-farm payrolls to rise by 75,000 in January. 
Estimates range from +35,000 to +160,000. 

     The unemployment rate is seen slipping to 4.9% from the 5.0% seen 
in December.   

     Ahead of that, Thursday's US data line includes personal income and 
spending and the Chicago purchasing managers index.

   LPUncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve would continue on its path of aggressive interest rate cuts made for another nervous session in financial markets yesterday. 

Interest rate futures continued to price in a strong chance that the US central bank would sanction a further 50 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate at yesterday's policy meeting, following last week's unscheduled 75bp easing. 
   TDHowever, stronger-than- expected economic releases over the last few days have led some strategists to challenge whether cuts of such magnitude could be justified. 

Yesterday provided another mixed bag of US economic releases. 

A survey from ADP Employer Services showed that 130,000 private sector jobs were created in January, about three times the expected increase, heightening expectations that tomorrow's crucial non-farm payrolls report could turn out to be stronger than expected. 

"ADP has proved itself horribly misleading several times over the past year but the fact remains that it is the best - or least bad, anyway - single advance indicator of payrolls," said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. 

However, US fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth came in much weaker than expected. 

The economy expanded at an annualised rate of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year - the slowest pace for five years and down sharply from 4.9 per cent in the third quarter. 

Stephen Stanley, chief US economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, warned the fourth-quarter advance was "too close for comfort" given the normal scope of revisions to the initial estimate. 

He suggested that assumptions made by the Commerce Department for December trade and inventories data were far too optimistic. "Depending on how the surprises elsewhere break, the fourth-quarter GDP number could easily end up slightly below zero." 

Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak, took a more optimistic view, saying the GDP report showed that business inventories had been "extraordinarily well managed" during the economic slowdown, boding well for the future. 

"Inventories are so lean that any increase in spending will almost immediately translate into an increase in industrial output, which, when it occurs, will boost incomes and lead to conditions consistent with sustained economic expansion," he said. 

Equity markets eased back across the board. In Asia, an early attempt to build on Tuesday's gains came to nought as uncertainty about the Fed set in. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average ended 1 per cent lower, while Hong Kong shed 2.6 per cent and Seoul fell 3 per cent to a nine-month low. 

European stocks adopted a similarly cautious tone, with fresh writedowns at Swiss bank UBS further damping the mood. 

The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.7 per cent, although German stocks outperformed as the Xetra Dax shed 0.3 per cent. 

The Fed decision came after European markets had closed. 

By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were both 0.3 per cent lower. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent. 

Government bonds edged back in quiet trading ahead of the Fed's decision. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury increased 2 basis points at 3.69 per cent and the two-year yield was also 2bp higher at 2.31 per cent. 

In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was up 3bp at 4.01 per cent - although the 10-year Japanese government bond yield fell 4 bp to 1.43 per cent following the slide in Japanese equities. 

Currency markets were also becalmed, with the dollar showing little reaction to the day's US economic data. The euro briefly edged above Dollars 1.48 but was back below that level by midday in New York. 

Sterling edged back after some grim data on the UK housing market. 

In commodities , oil prices showed little reaction to news of a bigger than forecast increase in US crude inventories last week. 

March West Texas Intermediate consolidated below the Dollars 92 a barrel mark as the market awaited news from this week's Opec meeting. 

Gold and platinum prices went into retreat after Tuesday's record highs as power was restored to some mining operations in South Africa.

 HDASIA FX: US Dlr Slips Vs Yen, Steady on Euro in Pre-FOMC Lull      WC623 words   PD30 January 2008   ET08:02   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.

     SINGAPORE, Jan. 30 (MNI) - The US dollar ended the Asian session 
with slight losses against the yen but relatively steady on the euro, 
while currency markets went into a lull before tonight's highly 
anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate decision. 

     Although markets have been pricing in a strong chance of an 
aggressive 50-basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate, overnight US 
data releases caused some lowering of those expectations, with many 
analysts now believing only a 25 basis point cut is on the cards. 

     "Futures markets show the Fed will cut 50 bps tonight, but we feel 
there is strong possibility that it may ease by just 25 bps for fear of 
promoting fear about the state of the US economy," LGT Asia analysts 
said in a daily note. 

     That uncertainty persisted in Asia this morning with stock markets 
in the region ending lower despite a mixed start as investors continued 
to fret about prospects for the US economy while marking time ahead of 
the Fed's interest rate decision. 

     Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 133.83 points, or 1%, lower at 13,345.03 
after swinging between positive and negative territory through the day, 
while in South Korea, the KOSPI index finished down by 48.85 points, or 
3.0%, at 1,589.06, a level unseen since last May. 

     "50bps is a possibility, but given that economic data does not 
point to a recession and how equity markets have stabilized since last 
weeks 75bps inter-meeting rate cut, we are more comfortable sticking 
with a 25bps ease," noted DBS Bank analysts. 

     In forex markets, currency pairs remained locked in narrow ranges, 
with most players content to allow carry trade flows to influence 
direction before tonight's Fed decision. 

     Dollar-yen came off an early Y107.18 high at the start of the day, 
and slipped below Y107.00 to hit bottom at Y106.70. That tracked a 
retreat in euro-yen, the cross sliding to a Y157.60 low after an early 
Y158.31 high. 

     Despite a midday bounce, dollar-yen went back toward its lows as 
the Asian session wound down, mostly holding between a Y106.67 low and 
Y106.88, while euro-yen stayed near Y157.50 to Y157.90. 

     Euro-dollar meanwhile, witnessed an early dip, also in tune with 
euro-yen's initial decline, slipping to $1.4760 against an earlier high 
of $1.4780. 

     Euro-dollar dipped further to $1.4756 in the early afternoon but 
bounced back toward the $1.4780 high as the weak dollar tone countered 
the drag from a falling euro-yen. 

     "The choice between a 25bp or 50bp rate cut is really the choice 
between being 'at the curve' or 'ahead of it,'" commented FX Capital 
Markets chief strategist Kathy Lien. 

     "Either way, there is a slim chance of the FOMC rate decision being 
dollar bullish because (Wednesday's) rate cut will certainly not be 
their last."

NOTES:   

If rates change more than once a month, the last rate for that month is listed.   

1. On March 9, 2006 the BOJ said it would no longer set a target for the amount of surplus funds in the money market, ending its "quantitative easing" policy, and adopted a more conventional tactic of guiding the unsecured overnight call rate. On July 14, 2006 it raised interest rates for the first time in six years.   

2. The  Swiss National Bank targets a range for the three-month Swiss franc LIBOR rate. It currently targets roughly the midpoint of that range.   

3. Table shows the Bank of Mexico's overnight lending rate. This replaces monthly averages of yields on 28-day Cetes treasury bills at weekly open market operations, as shown in past tables.   

4. On Jan. 17, 2007 the Bank of Thailand set a new policy rate based on the 1-day repurchase rate <BOT15>, instead of the 14-day rate. The rate was set at 4.75 percent, compared with the market close that day of 4.9375 percent. Comparison in the table for the end of 2006 shows the 14-day rate. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 HDFed Cuts Rates Boldly; Wall Street Wary      BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC968 words   PD30 January 2008   ET23:33   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve delivered powerful new relief to people and businesses squeezed by the ailing economy Wednesday, cutting interest rates ever deeper in an effort to avert or at least soften the blow of a recession.   

The bold, half-point reduction approved by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and all but one of his colleagues came as President Bush and Congress raced to enact a separate rescue package -- including tax rebates for individuals and tax breaks for companies -- to help energize an economy in danger of stalling.   
   TDHeartened by the Fed's newfound aggressiveness, Wall Street rallied but then pulled back, still wary. The Dow Jones industrials jumped more than 200 points after the announcement but ended up down 37.47.   

Commercial banks followed the Fed action by lowering their prime lending rate by the same half percentage point -- to 6 percent, the lowest in nearly three years. That prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans.   

Hours before the Fed's action, the government reported that the nation's economic growth had stumbled to a virtual halt. The economy grew at just a 0.6 percent pace from October through December, and for all of 2007 it logged its weakest performance in five years.   

The collapse of the housing market, sour mortgage investments and much harder-to-get credit are weighing on people and businesses alike. Foreclosures have hit record highs, and banks have racked up multibillion-dollar losses. The fallout has shaken Wall Street, catapulted the economy to Topic A among worried families and galvanized political figures, including those vying to be the next president.   

"The economy is hanging by a thread," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at  PNC Financial Services Group.

While Wednesday's interest rate cut was welcome, the Fed's blunt new assessment of the economy was sobering for everyone from business owners to people worried about debts to anyone without a job -- or fearful of losing one.   

"Credit has tightened further for some businesses and households," the Fed said. "Moreover, recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets."   

In its 9-1 decision, the Federal Reserve dropped its key rate to 3 percent at the end of a two-day meeting. Richard Fisher, president of the  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was the sole dissenter. He preferred no change.   

It was the second Fed rate cut in just over a week, and the policymakers signaled they were prepared to keep going lower if needed.   

There had been a rare, three-quarter point reduction last Tuesday. Bernanke had convened an emergency session after stocks worldwide plummeted, intensifying recession fears. The cuts have helped to restore some confidence among skittish investors, but financial markets remain fragile.   

In the gravest challenge to his leadership since becoming Fed chief nearly two years ago, Bernanke must help stem the fallout from both the housing bust and a credit crunch. Wall Street critics and others have taken Bernanke to task for waiting until September of last year to embark on a rate-cutting campaign, accusing the Fed chief of being behind the curve in dealing with the economy's problems.   

Bernanke also must be mindful of not letting inflation get out of hand -- a delicate and tricky maneuver. Oil prices have receded from $100 a barrel but still remain high. The Fed said it expects inflation to ease in coming quarters but added that it is imperative to monitor developments carefully.   

Still, more rate cuts are expected at the Fed's next scheduled meeting in March and beyond. Some economists predict the key rate could drop as low as 2 percent this year, which would be the lowest in four years.   

"The Fed needs to throw out a life raft to the economy pending the fiscal stimulus measures," said Brian Bethune, economist at Global Insight.   

Even further action might not avert a recession but rather limit the damage. The interest rate cuts will take months to affect the economy, as will any stimulus package approved by the government. Neither effort will quickly cure the root cause of the economy's troubles: a severely depressed housing market and bad mortgage investments.   

The economy may actually be declining now. Under one rough rule, it would have to contract for six months in a row for the country to be considered in a recession. The likelihood of a recession has risen sharply over the past year, and analysts increasingly believe the U.S. will be in one during the first half of 2008. The worry is that people and businesses -- which turned more cautious at the end of the year -- will hunker down, sending the economy into a tailspin.   

Bernanke is not expected to cut rates as deeply as did his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, when Greenspan took on the 2001 recession, the economic fallout of the Sept. 11 attacks, a series of accounting scandals that rocked Wall Street and the uncertainty that gripped the country leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003.   

By the summer of 2003, Greenspan had slashed rates to 1 percent, a 45-year low. He held rates there for a year before the Fed began pushing them back up.   

Critics contend those low rates helped feed a housing frenzy, in which home values zoomed and investors gobbled up risky loans, known as subprime mortgages, to borrowers with poor credit histories. When the housing market collapsed, the greatest damage was in subprime loans. Banks and other financial institutions have taken big hits on these soured mortgage investments.

 HDWRAPUP 2- Bank of Canada gears up for gentle rate cuts      BYBy Louise Egan and Randall Palmer      WC668 words   PD30 January 2008   ET22:56   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds quotes on currency, details)   

OTTAWA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The  Bank of Canada repeated its promise of lower domestic interest rates on Wednesday, and said the economy was adjusting well to a stronger Canadian dollar.   
   TDSpeaking to a parliamentary committee, Senior Deputy Governor Paul Jenkins said the central bank was poised to provide more stimulus to help prevent problems in a slowing domestic economy.   

But he gave no hint that Canada would match aggressive U.S. rate cuts -- the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points to 3 percent on Wednesday, following an emergency cut of 75 basis points last week. The  Bank of Canada had always assumed aggressive Fed moves were likely, he added.   

"In our base case projection, we had built in a considerable amount of easing on the part of the Federal Reserve, feeling that that was an important ingredient to get the U.S. economy moving forward," Jenkins said.   

The  Bank of Canada cut its own benchmark interest rate last week by a quarter-point to 4 percent and Governor David Dodge said the bank generally prefers "measured" moves.   

This is the first time since June 2004 that the Fed's rate is a full percentage point lower than the  Bank of Canada's, likely pushing the Canadian dollar higher.   

Jenkins insisted the central bank had no formal target for the Canadian dollar and said the bank thought a floating exchange rate was crucial to help absorb economic shocks.   

But an exchange rate around 98 U.S. cents -- the level assumed by the bank in its latest projections -- was "not inconsistent with the fundamental factors at play," he said. A broader range than that, but below parity with the U.S. dollar, would also reflect a strong economy, he added.   

"The movement up to the low 90 (U.S.) cent range to around parity would not be inconsistent with the increase in our terms of trade, or commodity prices more generally. But there's a wide confidence band around that," he said.   

Anything outside the range considered normal might influence interest rate decisions.   

"It's something we pay very close attention to, particularly if it were to move outside a range that we would think is consistent with these historical relationships. That would be something that we would clearly factor into our policy thinking," he said.   

The Canadian dollar climbed above the U.S. dollar last year for the first time in three decades, hitting highs around US$1.10 in November.   

It has slipped back since then, and was at around US$1.01 on Wednesday, valuing a U.S. dollar at 99 Canadian cents.   

The stronger currency boosts the cost of Canadian goods abroad and makes it harder for the manufacturing sector to compete.   

"What we have seen in terms of the adjustment taking place in the Canadian economy has actually been further along than we might have expected, based on history," Jenkins said.   

"When you look at what has happened in the Canadian economy more recently, we've actually been pleased with the adjustment that has taken place. That's not to say the adjustment hasn't been difficult," he said.   

Jenkins repeated the bank's latest economic forecasts for growth of 1.8 percent this year, rising to 2.8 percent in 2009. He expects inflation to fall below 1.5 percent by the middle of the year, before climbing back to the bank's 2 percent target by the end of 2009.   

The bank's next interest rate decision is March 4 and will be the first under the new governor, Mark Carney, who assumes office on Friday. (Additional reporting by Frank Pingue, Renato Andrade and David Ljunggren, writing by Janet Guttsman; editing by Rob Wilson)

 SEMARKETS   HDHopes for rate cuts help drive recovery from early losses.    BYBy CHRIS BRYANT    WC768 words   PD29 January 2008   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   EDAsia Ed1   PGPage 24   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPWall Street stocks recovered from early losses yesterday as hopes for more aggressive interest rate cuts spurred a rally in financial companies before the Federal Reserve's policy meetingstarts today. 

US equities fared much better than traders had initially feared but remained in a volatile mood, after a sharp sell-off in Asia and Europe looked set to deliver another down day in the US. 
   TDHowever, the outlook for investors was far from serene after new home sales plunged to a 12-year low and McDonald's shares hit the skids following some disappointing December same-store sales. 

In midday trading the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent at 1,337.24, off its highs for the session but having earlier fallen 0.6 per cent. 

The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,330.59, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.3 per cent to 12,2245.13. 

Since the Fed enacted an emergency 75 basis point rate cut last week investors have remained divided over whether the central bank will cut rates 25bp or 50bp at the end of its meeting tomorrow. 

The futures market has priced in an 86 per cent chance that the Fed will take the more dovish approach, which would lower the Fed funds rate to just 3 per cent. 

"Anything less than 25bp would probably risk a significant negative reaction in the financial markets," said Maury Harris, economist at UBS Investment Research. 

However, investors have yet to receive a clear signal about whether last week's mini-recovery showed equities were oversold or was merely the product of a fleeting bear-market rally. 

Given the acute concerns that the economy is entering a recession, this week's data on the state of the labour and housing markets are of key importance. 

New home sales fell 4.7 per cent to a 604,000 annual rate in December, the lowest reading in 12 years, compared with expectations of about 650,000. 

In spite of the poor figures the homebuilder sector pared early losses to extend last week's 28 per cent rally as traders bet that rate cuts would help the sector. 

"The stock market apparently believes the worst is over," said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. "(However) We think the downside for activity and prices remains considerable. To repeat, there is no sign of a bottom in any of these data." 

Confidence in the health of the US consumer took another dent yesterday after McDonald's reported flat December same-store sales owing to a softening in consumer spending. The stock fell 5.3 per cent to Dollars 51.21 while rival Wendy's gave up 6 per cent to Dollars 23.75. 

Sears Holdings shed 0.4 per cent to Dollars 98.59 after its chief executive left. 

Financial companies enjoyed the best of the gains with Lehman Brothers

rising 2.3 per cent to Dollars 59.21 and JPMorgan up 2.1 per cent at Dollars 44.54. 

American Express, up 2.1 per cent at Dollars 46.41, was set to report after the closing bell. The credit-card issuer unnerved investors this month with a cautious outlook for the current year. 

The telecoms sector came under early pressure before rebounding after Verizon Communications quarterly results failed to beat analysts' estimates. 

Although quarterly earnings rose 3.9 per cent, in line with expectations, the shares fell 1.2 per cent to Dollars 37.31. 

There was better news for Corning , 3.6 per cent higher at Dollars 23.17, which increased fourth-quarter profit 11 per cent amid heavy demand for glass used in flat-screen televisions and computers. 

However, the transport sector retreated after YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell to a Dollars 735.8m loss, much worse than analysts had feared. The shares plunged 13.7 per cent to Dollars 16.27. 

There was mixed news on the dealmaking front after Alliance Data Systems ' Dollars 6.76bn buy-out by Blackstone was put into doubt when the private equity group raised the prospect that it may not win regulatory approval. Shares in the credit-card services provider plunged 34.3 per cent to Dollars 43.08 while Blackstone slipped 1 per cent to Dollars 19.16. 

However, Nymex Holdings , the commodities exchange rose 6.9 per cent to Dollars 114.50 after revealing that it was in preliminary takeover talks with CME Group , the Chicago-based exchange.

   LPIs the era of gradualism at the Federal Reserve over? After 125 basis points of interest rate cuts in the space of eight days some economists are asking whether the US central bank is taking a new approach to monetary policy. 

They see the new approach as one that emphasises getting rates down quickly to whatever level looks appropriate in the light of new information, rather than moving in a series of incremental steps. 
   TDIf these economists are right, the change would have far-reaching consequences for the US economy and financial markets. 

For decades the Fed has operated on an incremental basis both in good times and bad. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, was dubbed "quarter point Al" by traders for his habit of moving in 25 basis point increments. 

In his 18 years as the central bank chief Mr Greenspan never cut rates by more than 50 basis points in a single meeting. Ben Bernanke, Mr Greenspan's successor, cut by 75 basis points last week and has followed it up with a further 50 basis point cut this week. 

"Greenspan has left the building," says Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. "What now distinguishes Bernanke is his abandonment of Fed gradualism." 

There is a more prosaic explanation for the change: that the Fed simply realised it had fallen behind the curve and reasserted another Greenspan era principle - the "risk management" approach to policy that buys insurance against worst case outcomes. 

This is almost certainly the way that longtime Fed officials such as vice-chairman Don Kohn regard the latest cuts. 

But the academics on the committee may also see other reasons for operating in a less gradual fashion that reinforce the traditional risk management logic. 

"The kind of moves we have seen recently are unprecedented," says Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank securities. "That certainly raises the possibility of something new afoot here." 

Vincent Reinhart, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former chief monetary economist at the Fed, says: "They have moved away from gradualism." 

Mr Reinhart says Fed gradualism was hard to square with cutting edge academic research on optimal control theory. "In these models you front-load policy changes." 

One justification for moving incrementally is that it encourages investors to extrapolate a series of moves in the same direction, allowing policymakers to influence long term rates. 

However, theory suggests front-loaded rate changes could have an equally powerful effect but in a different way: shifting the yield curve up or down rather than tilting its slope. Such an approach would change the way Fed policy affects the economy, altering its relative traction on adjustable rate and fixed-rate mortgages, short and long term investments and on bank profitability. 

Mr Bernanke is unlikely to favour going all the way to a front-loaded policy framework. He takes seriously the Brainard principle, which advises moving incrementally when the power of a policy move is not known. 

But as the Fed chairman explained in a speech in October, the Brainard principle is less compelling in circumstances where there may be heavy costs to delay. 

Governor Frederic Mishkin took this argument a step further this month, when he called for a less "inertial" approach to policy in the face of financial disruptions. The result could be a fusion of traditional Fed risk -management thinking with a new academic bias towards more front-loading of policy change. The result would be risk management on -steroids. 

However, it would imply a willingness to stay on hold when expected weakness materialises and to raise rates quickly when risks abate. Markets, and the political class, may not be expecting this.

 HDSources: Shift In ECB Stance May Take Time; Rates On Hold      WC1,346 words   PD30 January 2008   ET16:20   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.   
   TD

     FRANKFURT (MNI) - Although the European Central Bank's Governing 
Council is keenly aware of downside risks to the eurozone economy, it 
will not seriously consider cutting interest rates as long it continues 
to see a danger of second round inflation effects from this year's wage 
negotiations, well-placed sources told Market News International. 

     The bottom line is that ECB rates are likely to remain on hold for 
the foreseeable future. A shift in the bank's monetary policy stance 
would take some time to materialize -- barring a sharp deterioration of 
the economic outlook. 

     The sources said Council members know that downside risks to 
economic growth in Europe are mounting and that an unexpectedly sharp 
slowdown would tend to dampen inflation, which could at some point 
create leeway for a rate cut. But the ECB needs more time to gauge those 
growth risks, and it remains very worried about inflationary pressures. 

     "So far, the possibility of interest rate cuts has not been 
discussed," said a senior source. "In my opinion, rates should remain 
unchanged until the picture becomes clear. We must see whether downward 
risks to growth materialize and to what extent." 

     The next few months will be critical in assessing the trajectory of 
the U.S. economy and this year's wage round in Europe, the sources said. 
The ECB's Governing Council will also be looking very closely at the 
revised projections for eurozone growth and inflation to be presented by 
the Eurosystem staff and published in early March. 

     Action by the Federal Reserve - which is meeting today to decide 
whether to cut interest rates for the second time in as many weeks - 
will also be taken into consideration, but is only one among many 
factors. 

     Some sources indicated that the latest round of hawkish ECB 
rhetoric was meant in part to squelch market speculation, which followed 
the Fed's surprise 75 basis point rate cut last week, that the ECB could 
soon follow suit. 

     "When there are expectations building [of a rate cut] and that is 
not something that is being planned, you have to make sure that those 
expectations do not become embedded," said one source. 

     Another central bank official made the case more forcefully - and 
hawkishly. "It is premature to talk about a rate cut, and the ECB will 
not be dictated to by the markets on its policy stance," this official 
said. 

     He added that the ECB has "a tightening bias which, in my opinion, 
is appropriate and reflects the current economic environment in the 
eurozone. Inflationary risks remain on the upside and the rise in the 
inflation rate...should be dealt with responsibly, to avoid becoming 
permanent." 

     But a fourth source said he doubted the ECB would hike rates again, 
despite the toughness of some recent comments on inflation. 
 
     "Personally I would be surprised, given the information and the 
prospects we have," this official said. "We have excessive inflation, 
yet we have these risks to growth, the size and duration of which we 
don't know." 

     There appear to be diverging views on the Council over whether the 
threats to growth now outweigh inflation risks. A fifth source suggested 
there may even be a few Council members who would favor a pre-emptive 
rate cut in the face of a deteriorating economic situation. But their 
view is not widely held in the policy-making body - at least not yet, he 
said. 

     This source also indicated that unless the economic situation 
clearly worsens, it is doubtful the ECB will change its language before 
new economic projections are published in March and the central bank has 
a better idea what will come out of wage talks. 

     Still, he suggested that ECB rhetoric could start to move slowly 
towards a more neutral stance. He and others conceded that the 2008 
eurozone growth projection could well be downgraded. 

     One of the sources said that in preparation for the next economic 
forecasts, to be published in early March, the ECB staff is "doing more 
of these adverse simulations - ie, that the outcome [for growth] may be 
worse than we had previously expected." 

     According to this source, the ECB will probably stay on hold for "a 
while" longer, but pressure could mount to cut interest rates if the 
economy continued to slow down. The ECB could give in to such pressure 
at some point, he conceded. 

     "If things get worse, we can't rule it out," though the ECB would 
have to be convinced that a wage-price spiral could be avoided," the 
source said. In his view, developments in the U.S. will be crucial. 

     "Much depends on whether the U.S. economy falls into recession - 
that's the key," he said. "If that happens, then I think the 
consequences will be pretty severe." He expressed particular concern 
about the potential indirect impact on Europe should a U.S. slowdown 
dampen growth in Asian emerging markets. 

     "I think the next couple of months will be very critical," the 
source said, adding that he was referring not only to the U.S. but also 
wage negotiations in Europe. 

     Other sources noted that some of the recent hawkish comments by ECB 
Council members have been finely calibrated to stress the conditional 
nature of the bank's implicit warning that it could raise interest rates 
again if second-round inflation effects emerged. According to yet 
another official, expectations of slowing growth and receding inflation 
are being voiced in order to leave other policy options open. 

     However, the ECB may need some time to shift its public rhetoric 
away from a tightening bias, sources indicated. 

     For now, the economic risks facing the ECB and the conflicting 
implications these have for monetary policy require a delicate balancing 
act, both with regard to communication and to actual policy formulation. 
The senior source also did not exclude the possibility of an ECB rate 
cut at a later stage if the economy were to deteriorate and inflation 
decelerate. 

     "The ECB is not inflexible and does not precommit to decisions," 
that official said. "If a rate cut is needed, then we will also examine 
this possibility. But for the time being we must wait until the picture 
on economic trends, inflation, market turbulence and external factors is 
clear. All these will be discussed at our February and March meetings." 

     He said the U.S. subprime crisis has not yet harmed the real 
economy in Europe and cautioned that financial markets "should not 
panic" in response to the current "correction cycle." But he also warned 
that downside risks to growth are very real and could mount. 

     "If the U.S. economy enters a recession cycle, then [Europe] will 
face a slowdown in growth as well, but for the time being our estimates 
show that growth rates will remain slightly below potential," he said. 
"Further downside risks remain. Indeed, we might be reaching the end of 
the upward growth cycle in the eurozone." 

     For now, the ECB will "need to remain calm and observe how risks in 
the U.S. will materialize and how the actions taken by the Fed and the 
White House will be absorbed," he said, referring to U.S. monetary and 
fiscal policies aimed at stimulating the world's biggest economy. 

     The senior source was quick to balance remarks that might be viewed 
as dovish with the ECB's standard hawkish warning. 

     "We are ready to step in and take whichever decisions are necessary 
to maintain price stability," he said. "Avoiding secondary [inflation] 
effects is of the essence," he added, noting that oil price and wage 
developments would be decisive. 

     "Our estimates show that the inflation rise is temporary, but if 
the scenario of it becoming permanent materializes, then the appropriate 
decision will be taken," he said. "However, the data we have seen so far 
show that inflation in Germany is seen below 2% in 2008, so that is good 
news."

 HDUS Rep Frank Apologizes For Quip On Dems Replacing Bernanke      WC418 words   PD30 January 2008   ET20:25   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.

By Rebecca Christie

     WASHINGTON (MNI) - U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of 
the House Financial Services Committee, Wednesday apologized for his 
recent quip that a Democratic president might want to replace Federal 
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term expires in 2010. 

     "I made a rookie mistake, about which I am embarrassed and which I 
believe it is important to correct," Frank said in a press release. 
"This is a very difficult time for our economy and unbalanced and unfair 
criticism of Mr. Bernanke is therefore not simply a matter of his 
feelings, but of potentially, even if inadvertently, undermining the 
confidence people must have in the public policy response to our current 
problems." 

     Frank said he erred when he suggested that Democrats might want 
someone "who's more in tune" with Democratic views on the economy. He 
said the comment wasn't reported in its full context, but he also said 
he felt it was important to clarify his comments. It is "entirely 
untrue" that Frank already wants to replace Bernanke, as the quote might 
have implied, the lawmaker said. 

     "My answer should have been that it was silly to speculate about 
that because the factors that would go into a president's decision to 
name a Fed Chairman more than two years from now remain largely 
unknown," Frank said.

     "I gave what I thought was a fairly trite answer pointing out that 
it is always possible that a president of one party might decide he 
preferred a different appointee than one he inherited from another 
party, but that was made as a general statement and not with any regard 
to the need, likelihood of, or desire to see Mr. Bernanke replaced," he 
said. 

     For now, Frank said he's generally happy with Bernanke, even if he 
doesn't always agree with the Fed chairman. For example, Frank said he 
disagrees with the Fed's recent assessments of the balance of risks 
between inflation and economic weakness, as well as some aspects of the 
Fed's proposed subprime mortgage regulations.

     Still, that doesn't take away from Bernanke's "thoughtful 
commentary" on financial issues, he said. And Frank praised the Fed's 
recent "dramatic action" of a 0.75-point intermeeting interest rate cut. 

     "I am on the whole favorably impressed with Chairman Bernanke's 
role at the Fed," Frank said.

 HDUPDATE 2-Gross says Fed should not cut funds rate to 1 pct      BYBy John Parry      WC453 words   PD29 January 2008   ET15:34   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds more comments from Gross)   

NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should not cut its benchmark interest rate as low as 1 percent because of the inflation risks and danger of weakening the dollar, the manager of the world's biggest bond fund said on Tuesday.   
   TDEconomists expect the fed funds target rate, now at 3.5 percent, will bottom at around 2.5 percent in the current monetary easing cycle, according to a Reuters poll on Monday.   

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke "must recognize the reduced benefits and obvious dangers of a deja vu trek to 1 percent short rates," wrote Bill Gross, chief investment officer of bond fund management company PIMCO or  Pacific Investment Management Co. in a February Investment Outlook.   

Gross manages the PIMCO Total Return Fund, the world's biggest bond fund.   

Such deep cuts in the funds rate now would likely cause "bubble creating, inflation inducing damage to the U.S. dollar," Gross wrote.   

The Federal Reserve slashed the funds rate by 75 basis points in an emergency rate cut on Jan. 22 to the current 3.50 percent. Market analysts expect the Fed to cut that rate again when its scheduled monetary policy setting meeting ends on Wednesday.   

The Fed last cut the funds rate to 1 percent in June 2003, sending Treasury yields to their lowest in four decades and helping to accelerate a housing market boom with cheap mortgages.   

But cutting the funds rate so low again would not fix weakness in the U.S. economy, as house prices slide and activity ebbs, Gross argued.   

"An artificially low, 1 percent short-term interest rate was an elixir during the days of a burgeoning shadow banking system. It cannot be the solution now," he wrote.   

To keep mortgage rates low, Gross favors reform rather than very aggressive rate cuts.   

"Best to stop far short of 1 percent and at the same time encourage reforms in FHA (Federal Housing Administration) government assisted programs that would permit subsidized mortgage rates with minimal down payments," Gross wrote.   

But restoring the U.S. and world economies to brisker economic growth will take some time, Gross signaled.   

"In late 2008, the U.S. economy and its somewhat coupled global companion will sleep walk for some time and a resumption of prosperity as we knew it will be dependent on reforms of monetary and fiscal policy resembling the 1930s more than our past decade," he wrote.

 HDUS borrowing costs likely to drop as Fed weighs another rate reduction      BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC593 words   PD29 January 2008   ET20:12   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. individuals and businesses are likely to see their borrowing costs drop further as the Federal Reserve weighs another interest-rate reduction to bolster a sagging economy.   

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues opened a two-day meeting Tuesday afternoon to plot their next move on interest rates. The closed-door gathering comes amid growing fears the U.S. is either on the brink of a recession or has already started slipping into one given the strains from a housing market collapse, a global credit crunch and turbulence on Wall Street. The country's last recession was in 2001.   
   TDMany economists believe the Fed will lower its key rate, now at 3.5 percent, by as much as one-half percentage point to 3 percent when policymakers wrap up their meeting Wednesday afternoon.   

If that scenario plays out, commercial banks would be expected to lower their prime lending rate by a corresponding amount -- from 6.5 percent to 6 percent. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans. Should all this happen, then both the Fed's key rate and the prime rate would be at nearly three-year lows.   

In an emergency gathering convened by Bernanke last week, the Fed ordered a rare, three-quarter-point reduction to its key rate. That move came after stocks worldwide plummeted, intensifying recession fears. The Fed's action has helped to restore some confidence among skittish investors. However, financial markets remain fragile.   

"My feeling is if they don't cut by a half point, they risk undoing the good they did last week with the three-quarter point cut," said Mark Vitner, economist at  Wachovia.

The Fed's rate-cutting campaign, which started in September, is not only aimed at energizing the economy but also providing a psychological boost to investors and consumers, whose spending is vital to the economy's well-being.   

Consumer confidence fell sharply in January, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The survey, however, was taken before the Fed's bold rate cut last week and before the White House and House leaders announced a joint agreement on an economic stimulus package including tax rebates for people and some tax breaks for business.   

The big worry is that consumers will clamp down on spending and businesses will put a lid on capital spending and hiring, throwing the economy into a tailspin.   

In an ongoing effort to provide relief to cash-strapped financial institutions, the Fed said Tuesday it had auctioned another $30 billion (euro20.3 billion) to commercial banks at an interest rate of 3.123 percent. Through the Fed's four auctions thus far, a total of $100 billion (euro67.7 billion) in short-term loans has been made available to banks. The first Fed auction of this kind was conducted in December.   

Other economic news released Tuesday showed that factories saw demand for their products rise in December by the largest amount in five months. That, however, didn't change the broader picture of a weakening economy.   

Many economists believe the U.S. economy grew at a feeble 1.2 percent pace during the final three months of last year. That would mark a big loss of momentum from the prior quarter's brisk 4.9 percent growth rate. The government releases its estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth Wednesday.

 HDUS Fed cuts a key  interest rate  for the second time in 8 days      BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER      CRAP Economics Writer   WC800 words   PD30 January 2008   ET20:32   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut a key interest rate for the second time in just over a week, reducing the federal funds rate by a half point. It signaled that further rate cuts were possible.   

The Fed action pushed the funds rate to 3 percent. It followed a three-fourths of a percentage point cut on Jan. 22, a day after financial markets around the world had plummeted on fears that the U.S. economy was heading into a recession. That decrease had been the biggest one-day move in more than two decades.   
   TDThe half-point cut Wednesday followed news that the economy had slowed significantly in the final three months of last year with the gross domestic product expanding at a barely discernible pace of 0.6 percent, less than half what had been expected. The report came amid increased concern from several quarters about a possible recession.   

In a brief statement explaining their decision, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues said that "financial markets remain under considerable stress."   

The Fed move was approved on a 9 to 1 vote. Richard Fisher, president of the Fed's Dallas regional bank, dissented, preferring no change in rates.   

The rate cut marked the fifth time that the Fed has cut the funds rate since it started with a half-point cut on Sept. 18 in response to the severe credit crisis which hit global markets in August.   

The latest Fed action was expected to be quickly followed by cuts in banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark rate for millions of consumer and business loans. The Fed's hope is that by making credit cheaper, it will encourage more borrowing, giving the economy a needed boost.   

The Fed's half-point move met expectations of financial markets and was a bolder move than the smaller quarter-point cut that many economists had been expecting.   

In its statement, the Fed said that "downside risks to growth remain" and pledged to "act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks." That was seen as a pledge to cut rates further if the economy continues to weaken.   

On inflation, the Fed officials said that they expected inflationary pressures to moderate in coming quarters but they also pledged to monitor price developments closely.   

The GDP report showed that a key gauge of core inflation, which excludes energy and food, jumped at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the final three months of last year, the fastest increase in a year and up sharply from a 2 percent increase in the July-September quarter.   

The economy has been dealt a series of blows from a two-year slump in housing to a severe credit squeeze as banks faced with billions of dollars in losses from mortgage defaults have cut back on their lending and tightened standards.   

The GDP report showed that the housing collapse had depressed economic growth last year by the largest amount in a quarter-century. Policymakers are worried that the slump could intensify this year as millions of subprime mortgages rest at higher rates.   

To combat the threat of a recession in an election year, the Bush administration has been negotiating with congressional leaders for an economic stimulus package of around $150 billion (euro101.28 billion), focused on tax rebates for households and business tax breaks to spur investment. The House passed its version of the proposal on Tuesday but Senate action could be delayed by efforts to expand the relief to senior citizens and the unemployed.   

The Fed move Wednesday occurred at the first regularly scheduled meeting of 2008 for the Federal Open Market Committee, the group of Fed governors in Washington and regional Fed bank presidents who set interest rates.   

The Fed's three-quarter-point cut on Jan. 22 was taken after an emergency video conference held by Bernanke and other members of the FOMC.   

That rate cut, the biggest reduction in the funds rate in more than two decades, was seen as an effort to boldly demonstrate that the central bank was prepared to do whatever necessary to keep the country from slipping into a recession -- or at least make the downturn milder than it would have been otherwise.   

Financial markets had complained that once the credit crisis hit in August, the Bernanke-led Fed had been too tentative in its responses until last week's move.   

Many private economists believe the central bank will keep cutting rates through the spring, especially if the unemployment rate keeps rising. The jobless rate jumped from 4.7 percent to 5 percent in December, the biggest one-month increase in five years.

 HDShares of national banks rise after the  Federal Reserve  cut a key  interest rate  to 3 percent      WC236 words   PD30 January 2008   ET20:40   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Shares of national banks rose Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve Board cut a key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.5 percent.   

Wednesday's cut comes on the heels of a three-quarters of a percentage point reduction last week by the Fed.   
   TDNational banks may get a boost in earnings because of the rate cut. National banks in part rely on net interest income -- the difference between how much it costs the bank to borrow money and how much it charges to loan money to customers -- for profits. With lower interest rates, the margin should improve.   

The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other, is often used to calculate interest rates on typical consumer loans banks make to customers.   

Here's how stocks in the nation's largest banks were trading following the Fed decision:   

Shares of  Bank of America Corp. rose 83 cents, or 2 percent, to 42.77.   

Citigroup Inc. shares rose 31 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $28.22.   

JPMorgan Chase & Co. shares rose 25 cents to $47.70.   

Shares of  Wachovia Corp. rose 7 cents to $37.97.   

Wells Fargo & Co. shares rose 27 cents to $32.87.   

Shares of  Washington Mutual Inc. rose 60 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $18.60

 HDDollar skids lower after Fed cuts  interest rate  to 3 percent      BYBy TALI ARBEL      CRAP Business Writer   WC453 words   PD30 January 2008   ET22:55   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - The dollar slid lower Wednesday after the Federal Reserve made an expected half-point cut in the federal funds rate and signaled that more moves lower could be forthcoming.   

The euro jumped up to $1.4898 in late New York trading after the Fed's announcement, from $1.4776 Tuesday. Earlier in the day, the dollar had slipped very little against the euro, despite a U.S. Commerce Department report that showed the economy nearly stalled in the fourth quarter with a growth rate of just 0.6 percent, capping its worst year since 2002 -- even as inflation rates remain high.   
   TD"The market was not entirely convinced the Fed would move by 50 basis points," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the  Bank of New York. "If inflation continues to rise, the Fed has a problem on its hands."   

The British pound rose to $1.9942 late Wednesday, from $1.9900. The dollar lost earlier gains against the Japanese yen, falling to 106.95 yen from 107.12 yen.   

The Fed's action, its second in eight days, leaves the U.S. interest rate at 3 percent, compared with the 4 percent level of the European Central Bank and the 5.5 percent the Bank of England has.   

The Fed last week sought to restore calm to stock markets with a surprise three-quarter-point cut in interest rates to 3.5 percent.   

Cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy, but at the same time weaken a currency as traders transfer funds to assets where they can earn higher returns.   

The U.S. interest rate is now just 25 basis points above the Swiss interest rate, third-lowest among major developed countries, and the dollar could start looking attractive as a carry-trade currency once markets shake off their latest jitters.   

Carry trades involve borrowing currencies from countries with low interest rates, such as Japan and Switzerland, and investing the funds in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. Carry-trade beneficiaries are usually the euro and currencies of countries with high interest rates.   

"Carry trade is not really a flavor of the market at this point," said Dan Katzive, a senior currency strategist with  Credit Suisse. "If you did see a situation where risk appetite started to recover ... then you'd see the dollar weaken in a big way."   

In other New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.0857 Swiss francs from 1.0941 Swiss francs. The Canadian dollar was trading above parity for the second consecutive day, as the dollar fell to 98.86 Canadian cents from 99.80 Canadian cents.

 HDFED FOCUS-Weak growth,miscues may put Bernanke's job at risk      BYBy Mark Felsenthal and Tamawa Kadoya      WC888 words   PD29 January 2008   ET16:22   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's job rides on protecting the U.S. economy from the worst of the fallout from housing and financial market turmoil, but politics and a few missteps could determine if he wins another term.   

Bernanke's four-year term as chairman expires on Jan. 31, 2010. The next president, who will take office in early 2009, may consider whether to tap someone else to lead the Fed.   
   TDWhile highly regarded as an economist and praised for his efforts to demystify the U.S. central bank, Bernanke's first two years in office have been dotted with controversy. Lately, he has faced a storm of criticism for his handling of a financial crisis that burst into public view in August.   

"They have contributed to the volatility," said Richard Gilhooly, fixed-income market strategist at  BNP Paribas in New York. "Much of the fear of recession is based on a confusion, a lack of understanding and a lack of confidence in the policy that is being administered by the Federal Reserve."   

As stocks at home and abroad tumbled in the early weeks of the new year, the Fed surprised financial markets on Jan. 22 with an interest rate cut of three-quarters of a percentage point. The cut, which came a week before the Fed's next scheduled policy meeting, left the benchmark federal funds rate at 3.5 percent.   

The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is expected to lower interest rates by at least another quarter point at a two-day meeting ending on Wednesday -- just a day before Bernanke reaches the halfway point in his term as chairman.   

TURNABOUTS   

Ultimately, Bernanke's success in guiding the Fed will be judged on how short and shallow any U.S. downturn is and whether a recovery is on solid footing by early next year.   

But a series of stumbles dating back to the beginning of his tenure may build a case against his reappointment.   

In April 2006, as the Fed was trying to decide how high to push borrowing costs, Bernanke told Congress the Fed could take a pause at some point in its rate-hiking campaign, remarks that led to a rise in inflation expectations.   

Days later, CNBC anchorwoman Maria Bartiromo said Bernanke had told her at a dinner that markets had misconstrued his words to mean the Fed was done raising rates.   

Analysts savaged him for disseminating policy comments through an informal conversation. Bernanke later called the episode a "lapse in judgment."   

Then, even as problems with subprime mortgages spread this summer, the Fed said on Aug. 7 that inflation risks topped its concerns. But three days later, the central bank announced it stood ready to provide liquidity to cash-starved institutions, leading to complaints that the Fed was behind the curve.   

In December, Fed officials acknowledged worsening financial conditions but trimmed rates by a slim quarter point. Markets felt whipsawed when the Fed unexpectedly announced special auctions designed to thaw frozen credit markets the next day.   

Most recently, analysts have questioned whether the Fed panicked with last week's surprise cut in borrowing costs, the steepest reduction in more than 23 years.   

When France's second-largest bank, Societe Generale , announced $7 billion in losses due to unauthorized trades by a single employee the next day, market participants wondered whether SocGen's efforts to unwind those trades helped push markets lower and had misled the Fed into cutting rates.   

IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID   

Bernanke, who was named to the Fed by President George W. Bush after serving as chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, could face political obstacles if the White House's next occupant is a Democrat.   

Political analysts believe Democrats have an advantage in November's presidential election because of economic uncertainties and other factors, but they also say it is an unpredictable time and anything could happen.   

"I think a Democratic president might find someone who's more in tune with Democratic views," the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.   

Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Bernanke's proposals to strengthen consumer borrowing protections had not been strong enough, echoing complaints from other Democratic lawmakers. The congressman also questioned Bernanke's effectiveness in blunting the effects of recent financial volatility.   

"He was a little slow in cutting (interest rates). I think he was a little too concerned with inflation," Frank said.   

Historically, presidents have sought to avoid rattling financial markets by switching Fed chairs put in place by predecessors. Ronald Reagan stayed the course with Paul Volcker; Bill Clinton left Alan Greenspan at the helm.   

Still, a Democrat might be inclined to pick among highly regarded economists or businesspeople with ties to the party to head the central bank.

   LP(Deletes incorrect reference in paragraph 10 to four-month slide in durable goods orders before December)   

(Updates prices, adds quotes after auction)   
   TDBy Burton Frierson   

NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices retreated on Tuesday as a rare bout of firm economic data tempered bets the Federal Reserve will maintain its aggressive approach to cutting interest rates.   

Rays of hope for a beleaguered economy emerged from reports on durable goods orders in December and consumer confidence this month, sending bond prices lower as traders reassessed their worst fears for growth. For details see [ID:nN29579979].   

Interest rate futures fell as investors pared perceived chances for the Fed to cut rates by a half percentage point on Wednesday, though they were still betting strongly on such an outcome.   

Soft demand at an auction of five-year government debt, following Monday's two-year auction, added selling pressure to a bond market already in profit-taking mode after a nearly non-stop rally since the middle of last year.   

"There was a little bit of a supply concession in the last two days with the two auctions and then there was the stronger durable goods data," said Carl Lantz, U.S. interest rate strategist at  Credit Suisse in New York.   

"It's not all that busy, with everyone just waiting for the Fed. People are squaring up positions. People who have been long are taking what profits they have left at this point."   

Five-year notes <US5YT=RR> fell 10/32 in price, which pushed the yield up to 2.86 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> were down 20/32 on the day, which lifted the yield to 3.66 percent from 3.58 percent late on Monday.   

The $14 billion sale of five-year debt attracted below-average demand overall. Appetite was also restrained among the large institutional investors and foreign central banks, the so-called indirect bidders, that traders monitor closely.   

"The market was trading much lower into the auction, and has since extended that trend post-auction -- in line with the modest indirect interest," said Ian Lyngen, interest rate strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut.   

The durable goods report was generally robust. Nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a proxy for business investment, rose for the first time since September.   

Dealers said they would keep this in mind as they awaited the Fed's decision on Wednesday.   

"I think big-picture nothing has really changed. The economy is still facing a lot of headwinds," said Lantz at  Credit Suisse, adding that Treasuries should be well supported regardless of the outcome.   

"Either the Fed cuts 50 basis points and is dovish, in which case the front end can rally some more," Lantz said. "Or they go 25 and equities get hammered and the flight to quality means that Treasuries actually don't do too bad.".

 HDFed acting "hyperactively" on rates-Nobel economist      WC377 words   PD30 January 2008   ET09:24   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPVIENNA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The latest interest rate cuts by U.S. Federal Reserve do not appear warranted by economic conditions and the ECB should not follow suit, Nobel prize winner Edmund Phelps was quoted as saying on Wednesday.   

"I'm not really thrilled by the Fed's interest rate cuts," Phelps told Austrian daily Die Presse when asked if a further rate cut by the U.S. central bank was the right way forward.   
   TD"The U.S. central bank is acting hyperactively at the moment. I see neither a decline in investments nor a huge drop in consumer spending that would explain such big interest rate cuts," he said according to comments published in German.   

Financial markets are pricing in another 50 basis point cut when the Fed announces the outcome of its latest meeting at 1915 GMT on Wednesday. It cut by 75 basis points last week, taking its benchmark rate to 3.5 percent, in a highly unusual move between scheduled meetings.   

"Private consumption has been anything but catastrophic of late," Phelps said of the Fed decision. "The problem just now is the financial market shock caused by the banking crisis. A central bank can't solve this problem."   

Phelps is an American professor at Columbia University who won the 2006 Nobel prize for economics.   

He said the European Central Bank, which has kept rates on hold at 4 percent since last June, should not follow the Fed's example.   

"The European Central Bank should do nothing at all for the time being and leave its key rate unchanged. The Fed is responding to politicians calling for lower interest rates. The ECB should not follow this line," he said.   

Phelps said rates should be cut when economic conditions warranted it, and that he did not see this in Europe. "The European economy is performing better than the U.S. economy. Furthermore, the ECB's remit is clear: it must keep inflation in check," he added.   

"One shouldn't ask too much of the ECB. A central bank can't keep inflation under control and create jobs."

 HDECB Update: Hawkish Talk To Slowly Soften As Growth Weakens      WC1,397 words   PD31 January 2008   ET16:45   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.

-- Regular Brief Analysis Of News And Events Pertinent To ECB Policy
-- See "ECB State Of Play" For Full Analysis Of ECB Policy Direction

     FRANKFURT, Jan. 31 (MNI) - A raft of eurozone data today provided 
another mixed bag that underscores the dilemma of upside price risks and 
downside growth risks confronting the European Central Bank. 

     Initially, the acceleration in HICP inflation to a record-high 3.2% 
in January -- the third month in succession in which the annual rate has 
been above 3% -- is certain to keep ECB hawks on the war path. 

     Doves, however, will be increasingly concerned about the ongoing 
deterioration in the outlook for growth, given another sharp decline in 
the EU Commission's latest economic sentiment survey. The likelihood is 
increasing that GDP will grow by less than trend potential in 2008. 

     The closely watched ESI came in well below expectations, falling 
1.7 points to 101.7 in January, while December's result was revised down 
by 1.3 points. The ESI is now down 10 points from its recent peak of 
111.6 in May. The extent and speed of that decline are not negligible. 

     All ESI components, particularly consumer sentiment and retail 
trade, weakened in January, as did the Commission's business confidence 
indicator. And the eurozone unemployment, while it remained at a record 
low of 7.2%, did not fall further, as had been expected. 

     While the elevated level of inflation will probably continue to 
feed hawkish rhetoric by the ECB for the time being, it is quite 
possible that public utterances will soon start to be softened gradually 
in response to the downward trend of economic indicators. 

     The ECB has said that in the absence of new shocks, HICP inflation 
should start to recede in the course of this year. That outcome is even 
more likely to emerge as activity continues to weaken. 

     The central bank's rate-hike threats have been clearly conditioned 
on the emergence of second-round inflation effects. The corollary would 
appear to be that the ECB could start backing away from its tightening 
bias as growth sags further and thereby reduces price stability risks. 

     The case for a gradual move by the ECB towards a neutral policy 
and, ultimately, monetary easing seems compelling. If inflation has 
peaked in January -- as many analysts believe -- and growth continues to 
slow down, the tone of ECB rhetoric will start to shift. 

     Whether this process becomes visible as soon as President 
Jean-Claude Trichet's next news briefing on February 7 is uncertain. The 
Governing Council's policy debate that day could be livelier than ever, 
but it's quite possible the consensus statement Trichet reads out 
afterwards won't differ much from the hawkish version from January 10. 

     The following month, on March 6, the ECB will publish its updated 
Eurosystem staff projections for eurozone GDP growth and HICP inflation. 
The GDP figures for 2008 and 2009 are almost certain to be revised down, 
and it is conceivable that the inflation numbers could be nudged lower 
as well. If so, the ECB could have a convenient springboard at that time 
for starting to modify its message. 

     The process may take some time to unfold, especially if inflation 
remains sticky and recedes only slowly, and if the ECB remains uncertain 
about how generous the pay deals to be negotiated this year will be. To 
that extent, Council hawks will put up resistance. 

     The weight of developments, however, favors the doves' position. 
They have slowly started to become more vocal, though they too have had 
to take account of the upside risks to price stability that still exist. 

     The bottom line: the ECB will soon start moving away from its 
tightening bias towards a neutral stance that could potentially stay in 
place for several months. Assuming the economy worsens further, a shift 
to an easing bias would probably follow, potentially by the late spring. 
A rate cut would probably not ensue before June or July and could even 
take somewhat longer to materialize, depending on developments. 

-- 

     FRANKFURT, Jan. 22 (MNI) - Tuesday's massive 75 basis point 
interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in the face of a global 
stock market meltdown will increase pressure on the European Central 
Bank to jettison its tightening bias and consider the need for cutting 
its own rates in response to intensifying threats to economic growth. 

     It is unclear how long the ECB can resist that pressure or how 
difficult it might be for the Governing Council to achieve a quick 
consensus on the possible need to shift its monetary policy into 
reverse. Some Council members apparently still see very little urgency, 
judging by their comments this week on inflation risks and economic 
growth near potential. 

     It is likely the ECB will be content for now to let the Fed do the 
heavy lifting - as it should do in response to a homegrown problem. If 
confidence is shored up enough for markets to gain a foothold, it's 
possible the ECB would refrain from action while slowly altering its 
rhetoric to signal a shift to a neutral bias -- and possibly beyond 
neutral. 

     Arguing against a near-term rate cut is the ECB's deeply rooted 
mistrust of dramatic policy actions aimed at fine-tuning the economy. 
The Bundesbank's old "steady hand" approach is still the guiding ethos 
at the ECB. 

     On a more complicated note, the ECB might face a credibility 
problem that could take some time to resolve. If it continues to talk 
tough on inflation in the face of crumbling growth prospects, it could 
risk being perceived as blind to the threats facing the real economy and 
in danger of falling behind the curve. 

     The problem would not completely disappear even if the ECB did 
shift gears swiftly in response to a deteriorating economic and 
financial environment. Having virtually painting itself into a corner 
with its harsh inflation rhetoric, the ECB would then face unflattering 
questions after the fact about its prior reading of reality. 

     If push came to shove, however, any concerns it might have about 
projecting a credible and authoritative image would nonetheless not 
prevent the ECB from responding appropriately -- especially if it were 
convinced that a greater than expected slowdown would likely reduce 
inflation dangers. 

     The ECB would probably be quite happy not to have to react to a 
market meltdown at this point, as this would give it time to gradually 
shift its policy stance and thus keep unpleasant questions to a minimum. 

     That shift has already started, and the ECB has indicated that it 
is increasingly aware of the risk that the eurozone slowdown will be 
more pronounced than it had anticipated. It has also watered down its 
assertions that Europe is relatively insulated from U.S. economic 
developments, and the latest equity market upheaval should make it even 
more alert to the risks involved. 

     That said, the ECB will want to wait for more evidence that the 
real economy in Europe could be hit hard by the financial disruptions 
amid signs of slowing demand in other parts of the world. 

     It may still take some exceptionally bad eurozone economic data to 
dislodge the ECB from its position of "very close" monitoring. And if 
markets do stabilize from here on, that will reaffirm the view of some 
Council members that the situation is not dramatic. 

     If, however, equity markets and confidence in general continue to 
spiral downward, the ECB could be forced to cut rates more quickly than 
the markets have been expecting, its inflation worries notwithstanding. 
Europe's economic fundamentals may be sturdier than those of the U.S. at 
the moment, but they could quickly become shaky if spillover effects are 
protracted or intensify. 

     Barring a severe jolt to the economy, it is hard to see the ECB 
communicating a major shift in its policy stance before the next staff 
projections are published in early March. 

     A major downward revision to the projections for economic growth -- 
which would tend to lower those for inflation as well -- could be the 
trigger for a move to neutral or possibly even to an easing bias. 
Conceivably, this could open the way to an ECB rate cut as soon as Q2.

 HD Federal Reserve  reduces federal funds rate by 1/2 point to 3 percent      BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER      CRAP Economics Writer   WC927 words   PD30 January 2008   ET20:57   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut a key interest rate for the second time in just over a week, reducing the federal funds rate by a half point. It signaled that further rate cuts were possible.   

The Fed action pushed the funds rate to 3 percent. It followed a three-fourths of a percentage point cut on Jan. 22, a day after financial markets around the world had plummeted on fears that the U.S. economy was heading into a recession. That decrease had been the biggest one-day move in more than two decades.   
   TDThe half-point cut Wednesday followed news that the economy had slowed significantly in the final three months of last year with the gross domestic product expanding at a barely discernible pace of 0.6 percent, less than half what had been expected. The report came amid increased concern from several quarters about a possible recession.   

In a brief statement explaining their decision, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues said that "financial markets remain under considerable stress."   

The Fed move was approved on a 9 to 1 vote. Richard Fisher, president of the Fed's Dallas regional bank, dissented, preferring no change in rates.   

The rate cut marked the fifth time that the Fed has cut the funds rate since it started with a half-point cut on Sept. 18 in response to the severe credit crisis which hit global markets in August.   

Financial markets, which had been hoping for a bolder half-point move, rallied on the announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been in negative territory shortly before the Fed action, climbed back into the positive range in the minutes following the statement, with the Dow Jones industrial average up by more than 100 points in late afternoon.   

Economists said the Fed decided to move a half-point rather than a quarter-point because it did not want an adverse reaction on Wall Street.   

"At this tenuous time, they did not want to disappoint the markets," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.   

Jones said he expected at least one more rate cut, probably a quarter-point, at the next Fed meeting in March or at the April meeting.   

The latest Fed action was quickly followed by cuts in banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark rate for millions of consumer and business loans. Banks announced that they were cutting the prime rate from 6.5 percent down to 6 percent, the lowest level for the prime since the spring of 2005.   

The Fed's hope is that by making credit cheaper, it will encourage more borrowing, giving the economy a needed boost.   

In its statement, the Fed said that "downside risks to growth remain" and pledged to "act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks." That was seen as a pledge to cut rates further if the economy continues to weaken.   

On inflation, the Fed officials said that they expected inflationary pressures to moderate in coming quarters but they also pledged to monitor price developments closely.   

The GDP report showed that a key gauge of core inflation, which excludes energy and food, jumped at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the final three months of last year, the fastest increase in a year and up sharply from a 2 percent increase in the July-September quarter.   

The economy has been dealt a series of blows from a two-year slump in housing to a severe credit squeeze as banks faced with billions of dollars in losses from mortgage defaults have cut back on their lending and tightened standards.   

The GDP report showed that the housing collapse had depressed economic growth last year by the largest amount in a quarter-century. Policymakers are worried that the slump could intensify this year as millions of subprime mortgages rest at higher rates.   

To combat the threat of a recession in an election year, the Bush administration has been negotiating with congressional leaders for an economic stimulus package of around $150 billion (euro101.28 billion), focused on tax rebates for households and business tax breaks to spur investment. The House passed its version of the proposal on Tuesday but Senate action could be delayed by efforts to expand the relief to senior citizens and the unemployed.   

The Fed move Wednesday occurred at the first regularly scheduled meeting of 2008 for the Federal Open Market Committee, the group of Fed governors in Washington and regional Fed bank presidents who set interest rates.   

The Fed's three-quarter-point cut on Jan. 22 was taken after an emergency video conference held by Bernanke and other members of the FOMC.   

That rate cut, the biggest reduction in the funds rate in more than two decades, was seen as an effort to boldly demonstrate that the central bank was prepared to do whatever necessary to keep the country from slipping into a recession -- or at least make the downturn milder than it would have been otherwise.   

Financial markets had complained that once the credit crisis hit in August, the Bernanke-led Fed had been too tentative in its responses until last week's move.   

Many private economists believe the central bank will keep cutting rates through the spring, especially if the unemployment rate keeps rising. The jobless rate jumped from 4.7 percent to 5 percent in December, the biggest one-month increase in five years.

 HDUPDATE 4-Fed slashes U.S. rates to blunt economic slowdown      BYBy Mark Felsenthal      WC818 words   PD30 January 2008   ET07:00   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds market close, background)   

WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates by a hefty half-percentage point on Wednesday as part of an ongoing aggressive effort to halt a sharp slowdown in an economy hit by a housing slump and a credit crunch.   
   TDThe Fed's action takes the bellwether federal funds rate to 3 percent, the lowest since June 2005, and comes just eight days after the central bank slashed rates by three-quarters of a point.   

The cumulative 1.25 percentage point reduction in the interbank overnight rate in less than two weeks ranks among the most abrupt rate-cutting sprees in the modern history of the U.S. central bank. (For details, click on [ID:nN29595217]).   

"The Fed has clearly decided that pulling out all stops to stabilize financial markets represents its main priority," said Lena Komileva, an economist at Tullett Prebon in London.   

The vote to lower rates, which was widely expected, was not unanimous. Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher dissented, preferring to hold borrowing costs steady.   

U.S. stock markets initially rallied in response to the rate cut, but renewed credit crunch fears erased the gains by the close. The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 37 points at 12,442. The dollar also moved lower, as did prices for longer-dated U.S. bonds, which are sensitive to inflation.   

RISKS TO GROWTH REMAIN   

The Fed said its rate-cutting campaign, which has brought borrowing costs down from 5.25 percent in five steps dating to mid-September, should help thwart the risk of recession, but it left the door open to future moves.   

"Today's policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, downside risks to growth remain," the Fed said. (For full text, click on [ID:nTRT000309])   

Still, when the Fed lowered rates on Jan. 22 it had cited "appreciable downside risks to growth." Analysts said the omission of the word "appreciable" in the latest statement suggests officials feel more comfortable having acted boldly.   

"The Fed is demonstrating that they are getting ahead of the curve," said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at  LPL Financial Services in Boston. "Maybe they feel that now, with this latest policy action, they have taken the worst-case scenario of a deep recession off the table."   

Market participants anticipate as much as a 52 percent chance the Fed's next move will be another half point rate cut, as implied by short-term interest rate futures.   

A Reuters poll of 16 top Wall Street dealers, found that 15 expect the central bank to lower borrowing costs again at its next meeting in March, although views were split on the size of the move. (For details, click on [FED/R])   

VICIOUS CREDIT CYCLE   

The Fed's action came on the heels of a government report showing that the economy grew at a weak 0.6 percent annual pace in the last three months of 2007 as consumers curbed spending and homebuilding plunged. Growth of 2.2 percent for all of 2007 marked the economy's weakest expansion in five years.   

At the same time, a report showing private-sector employers added three times as many jobs as expected in January and a report earlier this week showing a big rise in orders for U.S.-made durable goods pointed to some economic resilience.   

With a burst of aggressive rate cuts, the Fed is displaying its predilection for taking preventive action to halt what might become a vicious cycle of tighter credit or financial market turmoil amplifying a slowdown in economic activity.   

"Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households," the Fed said. "Moreover, recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets."   

However, the central bank also repeated that it would be monitoring inflation developments carefully, even though it expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters.   

In August, rising defaults on U.S. subprime mortgages led to a seizing up of credit markets. While conditions have improved, aftershocks from the subprime mortgage crisis have continued and financial markets remain volatile.   

At the same time, the housing market continues to plummet. Sales of new single-family homes fell 4.7 percent in December to their lowest level since 1995, the government said on Monday. For all of 2007, sales were off a record 26 percent. (Additional reporting by David Lawder in Washington and Jennifer Coogan in New York; Editing by Diane Craft)

 HDGermany's Glos welcomes US rate cut, stimulus plan      WC241 words   PD31 January 2008   ET13:51   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPPALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain, Jan 31 (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Michael Glos said on Thursday he hoped the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts and a U.S. economic stimulus plan would fend off the threat of a recession in the United States.   

"We hope that helps America to avoid a recession," Glos told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting between German and Spanish government leaders in Mallorca. The Federal Reserve cut U.S. rates by a half-percentage point on Wednesday as part of an aggressive effort to halt a sharp slowdown in the world's largest economy, which has been hit by a housing slump and a credit crunch.   
   TDThe reduction took the bellwether federal funds rate to 3 percent, the lowest since June 2005, and came eight days after the central bank slashed rates by three-quarters of a point.   

German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck told Reuters in an interview that last week's Fed cut was the right move for the United States but that there were arguments against it -- including a risk that it sent a bad signal to those responsible for recent market turmoil by "rewarding" them.

 HDFED FOCUS-Bernanke's age of dissent rolls on      BYBy Ros Krasny      WC748 words   PD30 January 2008   ET23:54   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPCHICAGO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The cavalcade of official dissents against Federal Reserve interest rate decisions rolls on, a trend some analysts feel undermines the bank's ability to gain traction with its policy shifts.   

Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher dissented from Wednesday's decision to lower benchmark lending rates by 50 basis points, a decision that came swiftly on the heels of an emergency cut of 75 basis points last week. Fisher wanted to leave rates unchanged.   
   TD"The dissenter ... preferred no change, suggesting that the debate was whether or not to cut rather than between 25 basis points and 50 basis points as many had speculated," said economists at  Goldman Sachs.

A reflection of the collegial leadership style of Chairman Ben Bernanke, the numerous dissents have fostered an impression that the Fed's general is not entirely in control of his troops.   

"Bernanke has given permission to dissent, and people are using that permission," said Rich Berg, chief executive officer of Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. "Bernanke is a consensus builder, not an autocrat."   

No more than one dissent has been made at any Fed meeting under Bernanke, but the frequency of such votes is thought to uncover deep divisions within the rate-setting Federal Open Mark Committee on the direction of policy at a time the Fed faces challenges on both the growth and inflation fronts.   

"It was the fourth consecutive decision with a dissent, so the discussion was likely vigorous," Gary Bigg, economist at Banc of America, said of Wednesday's vote. "I believe the discussion will be fairly robust going forward."   

Some Fed watchers have criticized the central bank for providing mixed messages on policy as officials have aired divergent views -- sometimes sounding dovish and hawkish on the same day.   

The shark-infested economic waters that the Fed is now swimming in argue for clarity, many analysts contend, and policy-makers recently have started to deliver.   

"Financial stress tends to create unity on the committee, but if markets become stable and the Fed can start looking at the real economy, some voters may come out of their shell," said Michael Feroli, economist at  JP Morgan Chase in New York.   

NO GREENSPAN   

Dissents were not unknown during the Alan Greenspan era at the Fed, but they became relatively rare in the final stages of that 18-year span, driven by the former chairman's belief that unanimous decisions strengthened the Fed's policy hand.   

From 2002 to 2005, Greenspan saw just two dissents from regional bank presidents: one from San Francisco in 2003 and one from Dallas in 2002, both in favor of lower rates. Two dissents were also made by Fed board governors.   

Even so, Greenspan faced more dissents at times of major policy inflection: the Kansas City Fed dissented twice and St. Louis once during the string of 2001 rate cuts, in each case in favor of tighter policy.   

Bernanke has had no dissents from members of the Fed's board since taking the reins on Feb. 1, 2006, but regional bank presidents have been another thing.   

Inflation hawk Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, famously dissented four straight times in favor of higher rates in late 2006.   

THE STREAK   

In October 2007, Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig argued against a rate cut, while in December Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren lobbied for a bigger reduction.   

When the Fed made its surprise rate cut on Jan 22, St. Louis Fed President William Poole voted nay. Fisher's dissent ran the streak to four.   

Among the 2008 voters, New York Fed President Tim Geithner and Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto have never dissented during their relatively brief tenures.   

Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser voted for the first time on Wednesday since joining the Fed in 2006, and stayed with the majority. But he is seen as Lacker's equal among Fed hawks.   

Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern, an elder statesman among the regional chiefs, strung together three hawkish dissents in 1996 but endorsed each decision in 1999, 2002 and 2005.   

"If Fisher can get Stern or Plosser to come over to his side, it would be embarrassing for the committee ... if there's an easing with two dissents," said Feroli. (Additional reporting by Tamawa Kadoya in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)

 HDFed starts two-day meeting, rate cut size debated      BYBy David Lawder      WC451 words   PD29 January 2008   ET20:09   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on Tuesday that was expected to end with the second interest rate cut in just over a week, but market confidence in an aggressive half-percentage point drop was waning.   

A Fed spokesman said the Federal Open Market Committee began its meeting at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). A statement outlining the central bank's rate decision is expected to be released at about 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT) on Wednesday.   
   TDThe Fed is mulling its next step to bolster the economy after stunning markets on Jan. 22 with its biggest rate reduction in more than 23 years -- an emergency move that brought the benchmark federal funds rate down three-quarters of a point to 3.5 percent.   

Since then, investors have widely bet the Fed would keep slashing to head off a recession given worsening financial market conditions.   

But after stronger-than-expected data on consumer confidence and durable goods orders on Tuesday, investors scaled back bets on a half-point move significantly.   

Short-term interest rate futures <FFG8> showed the implied chances for a half-point cut had dipped as low as 60 percent by midday on Tuesday from 86 percent on Monday. A quarter-point cut was still fully priced in.   

New orders for long-lasting U.S.-made manufactured goods rose 5.2 percent last month, the Commerce Department said, well above the 1.5 percent increase expected on Wall Street. The data suggested that the economy, aided by exports, may be healthier than some analysts have believed.   

Separately, the Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment fell to 87.9 in January from an upwardly revised 90.6 in December. Analysts had expected a reading of 87.5, and some said the data reflected consumer worries about housing and stock markets, but more confidence in jobs.   

"This is not the kind of data recessions are made of, and highlights how important employment is going to be in determining whether the economy can sneak by with a growth recession -- growth where unemployment rises -- or something much less benign," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut.   

The Fed's decision, however, will come before the all-important January U.S. payrolls report on Friday. Non-farm job creation dwindled to just 18,000 in December, but analysts polled by Reuters are predicting January job growth of 63,000. (Editing by Andrea Ricci)

   LPLONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The interbank cost of borrowing dollars eased slightly on Wednesday ahead of a widely-expected interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve later in day.   

U.S. rate futures are pricing in around a 75 percent chance of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed when it winds up its two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday, with around a one-in-four chance of a 25 basis point easing.   
   TDThe fed funds rate currently stands at 3.5 percent.   

Three-month dollar Libor slipped to 3.23938 percent from 3.24375 percent on Tuesday <USD3MFSR=> while one-month dollar rates edged down to 3.26375 percent from 3.27125 percent <USD1MFSR=>, according to the British Bankers Association's daily fixing.   

Euro and sterling Libor, while also continuing its broad drift lower in recent weeks, remained stickier.   

Three-month euro Libor was fixed at 4.38313 percent from 4.38688 percent <EUR3MFSR=> on Tuesday, and one-month euro Libor was fixed up a bit at 4.19375 percent compared with 4.19 percent <EUR1MFSR=>.   

Concerted central bank action and growing expectations of a European Central Bank rate cut had pushed euro Libor down over the past month but hopes for an imminent move from the ECB receded on Friday on hawkish talk by bank policymakers.   

Traders have scaled back bets of euro zone interest rate cuts and the trader scandal at French bank Societe Generale which cost it $7 billion has also fueled liquidity fears.   

Three-month sterling rates eased for the first session in five, but only barely, to 5.59 percent <GBP3MFSR=> from 5.59125 percent on Tuesday. One-month rates eased a bit to 5.57250 percent <GBP1MFSR=> from 5.57625 percent.

NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices retreated on Tuesday as a rare bout of firm economic data tempered bets the Federal Reserve would maintain its aggressive approach to cutting interest rates.   
   TDRays of hope for a beleaguered economy emerged from reports on durable goods orders in December and consumer confidence this month, sending bond prices lower as traders reassessed their worst fears for growth. For details see [ID:nN29579979].   

Interest rate futures fell as investors pared the probability they placed on the Fed cutting rates by a half percentage point when policy-makers meet on Wednesday, though they were still betting strongly on such an outcome.   

Stock market gains also dimmed the allure of safe-haven government bonds.   

"It looks like Treasuries have sold off because of the stronger-than-expected durable goods number and another day of positive stock market news," said David Coard, head of fixed income sales and trading at Williams Capital Group in New York.   

"There has been a reduction of bets that the Fed is going to move 50 basis points tomorrow. That's the bottom line and the durable goods number was the main driver of that sentiment. I think they will do 25."   

Five-year notes <US5YT=RR> fell 11/32 in price, which pushed the yield up to 2.87 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> were down 25/32 on the day, which lifted the yield to 3.68 percent from 3.58 percent late on Monday.   

Prices on the 30-year bond <US30YT=RR> tumbled more than a full point on the day, pushing yields up to 4.36 percent.   

CALLING ALL BIDDERS   

Soft demand at an auction of five-year government debt, following Monday's two-year auction, added selling pressure to a bond market already in profit-taking mode after a nearly non-stop rally since the middle of last year.   

The $14 billion sale of five-year debt attracted below-average overall demand. Appetite was restrained among the large institutional investors and foreign central banks, the so-called indirect bidders, that traders monitor closely.   

"There was a little bit of a supply concession in the last two days with the two auctions and then there was the stronger durable goods data," said Carl Lantz, U.S. interest rate strategist at  Credit Suisse in New York.   

"It's not all that busy, with everyone just waiting for the Fed. People are squaring up positions. People who have been long are taking what profits they have left at this point."   

The durable goods orders report was generally robust but followed a period of weakness.   

Dealers said they would keep this in mind as they awaited the Fed's decision on Wednesday.   

"I think big-picture nothing has really changed. The economy is still facing a lot of headwinds," said Lantz at  Credit Suisse, adding that Treasuries should be well supported regardless of the outcome.   

"Either the Fed cuts 50 basis points and is dovish, in which case the front end can rally some more," Lantz said. "Or they go 25 and equities get hammered and the flight to quality means that Treasuries actually don't do too bad." (Editing by Neil Stempleman)

 HDFACTBOX-Gulf Arab responses to U.S.  interest rate  cuts      WC625 words   PD31 January 2008   ET12:38   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPJan 31 (Reuters) - Gulf Arab oil producers, all but one of which peg their currencies to the dollar, have tended to track U.S. interest rate changes to maintain the relative value of their currencies.   

Here are details of how the six, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have responded to five Federal Reserve rate cuts since Sept. 18, which have brought the U.S. benchmark fed funds rate to 3 percent.   
   TDSAUDI ARABIA   

Benchmark rate: Repurchase rate at 5.5 percent since Feb. 8, 2007   

* The central bank, which declined to match the first 50 basis-point cut in September, has slashed its reverse repurchase rate by 200 basis points since Sept. 18 to deter bets on an appreciation of its dollar-pegged riyal.   

The central bank has also raised the reserve requirement of banks to 10 percent from 7 percent in two moves since Nov. 1, forcing lenders to keep more money in its vault to prevent lower interest rates from fuelling inflation.   

Its benchmark lending rate has remained unchanged at 5.5 percent.   

KUWAIT   

Benchmark rate: Discount rate at 5.75 percent since Jan. 23, 2007   

* Kuwait, the only Gulf Arab country to peg its currency to a basket rather than the dollar, lowered its benchmark discount rate for the first time in 18 months by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent on Jan. 22. The central bank governor said the move aimed to reduce the gap between dinar yields and interest rates on deposits in other currencies.   

Kuwait, whose basket gives it more flexibility on interest rates, has reduced its repurchase rate by 175 basis points to 3.5 percent in four moves since Sept. 18.   

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES   

Benchmark rate: Over-night repurchase rate at 3 percent on Jan. 31   

* The central bank has slashed its repo rate by 175 basis points since setting it at 4.75 percent on Nov. 29, two days after the country revamped its monetary policy tools, replacing a daily sale of fixed-rate certificates of deposit with an auction. The central bank has refrained from releasing the auction results.   

QATAR   

Benchmark rate: Lending facility rate at 5.5 percent since July 3, 2006   

* The central bank has cut its overnight deposit facility by 215 basis points since Sept. 18. It has kept its lending facility and repurchase rates steady at 5.5 and 5.55 percent, respectively.   

BAHRAIN   

Benchmark rate: The one-week deposit rate is the central bank's key policy rate.   

* Bahrain, which held back from matching the first Fed cut in September, has reduced its deposit rates by 200 basis points in five moves since Nov. 1. The one-week deposit rate is 3 percent, in line with the Fed, after the latest reduction on Wednesday. Bahrain has kept its overnight secured and repo rates, which guide lending rates, steady at 5.25 percent, having cut each by 25 basis points on Nov. 1. It also raised bank reserve requirements to 7 percent from 5 percent on Jan. 23.

 HDANALYSIS-CMBS era of issuance grinds to halt in January   BYBy Al Yoon      WC702 words   PD29 January 2008   ET22:30   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The credit crunch could see the commercial mortgage-backed securities market passing an ominous milestone -- the first month in its two-decade history without a single issue priced.

None of the $37 billion in issues slated for the first quarter has priced, including Blackstone Group's $10 billion deal backed by Hilton Hotels and bonds assembled by dealers such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc . Their absence bodes poorly for the buyout boom that depended on the market for cheap financing, analysts and investors said.
   TDThe commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) market has been rocked by the fallout of the mortgage crisis as investors reduce risk appetites for all assets. The market in 2008 has faltered further, pushing yield premiums to record levels, saddling issuers with loan inventories and preventing them from making many new loans.

"If you originated loans in 2007, chances are now you are facing a wider spread environment and it may not make sense economically" to issue bonds, said Alan Todd, head of CMBS research at JPMorgan Chase & Co., a top underwriter. "Also, new originations have been slow" because lenders have not been making new fixed-rate loans, he said.

No demand for floating-rate deals also hurt issuance, said Darrell Wheeler, head of CMBS research at Citigroup Inc.

January appears to be the first month without issuance under the current market format, or since the Resolution Trust Corp stopped issuing CMBS in 1995, he said.

Dealers sold a record $233.7 billion of U.S. CMBS in 2007, up 14 percent from 2006 even as volume began to dry up at midyear, according to Credit Suisse. Issuance first exceeded $100 billion in 2005 as the bonds became popular funding tools for leveraged buyouts.

Hopes for issuance in 2008 turned bleak as gyrations in global markets sent risk premiums soaring.

Yields on the safest benchmark 10-year CMBS have blown out by 65 basis points to 145 basis points over interest rate swaps since December, according to JPMorgan. The premium was less than 30 basis points in the first quarter of 2007 when dealers sold more than $62 billion in the bonds.

The 10-year spread reached an intraday high of 175 basis points on Jan. 23 after an emergency Federal Reserve interest rate cut failed to soothe U.S. markets following a global asset sell-off, according to RBS Greenwich Capital. Investors also tried to sell more than $1 billion in existing CMBS, it said.

"For banks, the intraday volatility in spread is just too much to swallow," Brad Messinger, head of capital markets at Zenta, a New York-based company which helps dealers price and sell bonds, said in a Friday interview.

CMBS had also been a key funding source for the buyout boom that peaked last year -- but since the credit crunch lenders have grown wary of buyout-related CMBS, citing concerns over leverage, pricing and a lack of diversity since they are often concentrated on a single sector with unique risks.

Should they be unable to syndicate the debt on favorable terms, underwriters may be forced to take write-downs or make price concessions.

Price volatility in financial markets and expectations that delinquencies on properties from office buildings to hotels will rise has kept investors at arm's length, having watched the implosion in residential mortgage debt. This has sent Wall Street dealers far and wide to drum up new investors, including trips to Asia and Eastern Europe, Zenta's Messinger said.

The logjam will break when hedge funds that have been raising cash decide asset prices have fallen to attractive levels, he said. There is no consensus as to when hedge funds will start buying, Messinger added.

"All the dealers are trying to figure out what to do" to resume lending, Chris Lau said in a Monday trading commentary for RBS Greenwich Capital. Some may forgo issuance for the entire quarter and transfer loans off balance sheets to third-party funds, he said. (Additional reporting by Jonathan Keehner; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)

   LPWASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday resumed a two-day policy meeting that is widely expected to result in a decision to cut U.S. interest rates again to shore up the faltering economy.   

A Fed spokesman said the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee resumed its meeting at 9 a.m. EST (1400 GMT). A statement outlining the central bank's rate decision is expected to be released at about 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT).   
   TDShortly before the meeting began, the U.S. government said the economy expanded at a sluggish 0.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, capping off the weakest year of growth in five years.   

However, a separate report on Wednesday showed an unexpectedly large increase in private-sector employment this month and betting in financial markets on how sharply the Fed may lower borrowing costs was little changed.   

Interest-rate futures prices implied about a 78 percent chance of a half-percentage point cut that would take the benchmark federal funds rate down to 3 percent. (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Andrea Ricci)

 HDASSET-BACKEDS-ABX little changed after Fed rate cut      BYBy Nancy Leinfuss      WC488 words   PD30 January 2008   ET22:36   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A key derivatives index traded mixed on Wednesday after a highly-anticipated interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve to help shore up the U.S. economy still reeling from the subprime mortgage crisis, traders and investors said.   

Fed policymakers cut key interest rates by 0.50 percentage point on Wednesday following an emergency 0.75 percentage point easing last week. By cutting rates the central bank essentially lowers the costs of borrowing for businesses and consumers and helps to keep the economy from slipping into a recession.   
   TDThe ABX, a synthetic index of U.S. home equity ABS tied to credit default swaps, which is used by investors to hedge their subprime mortgage risks, posted slight gains along the highest-tier slice while lower-rated tiers ended firm to weaker, traders said.   

"ABX prices didn't move much. A 50 basis point rate cut was what was expected, anything less would have been a disaster," said one bond investor.   

The "AAA" tier of the ABX 07-1 index traded up to 74.16, versus 74 in the prior session, while the "AA" portion was unchanged at 43.16, while the "A" slice fell one point to trade at 20, traders said. The riskiest "BBB" index fell to 13.24, compared with 14 at the prior close.   

Market analysts agree recent interest rate cuts by the Fed will provided tremendous help to borrowers, facing sharply higher monthly mortgage payments as their home loans reset.   

"The rate cuts are Chairman Bernanke's de facto rate reset freeze that easily eclipse Treasury Secretary Paulson's efforts, since they become effective immediately and the reset freeze applies to all borrowers, not only subprime," said Christopher Flanagan, analyst at JP Morgan Securities.   

The analyst noted that if the Libor rate reaches 2.50 to 2.75 percent, the average subprime mortgage at six-month Libor plus 600 basis points, will remain at 8.50 to 8.75 percent, eliminating or reducing payment shock for borrowers.   

Glenn Schultz, analyst at Wachovia Securities agrees. "The market in all its angst over the subprime meltdown, the problems with the Paulson plan and loan modifications have missed an important turning point in the subprime story. That is, that the Fed, through its monetary policy initiatives, has gone a long way to minimizing payment shock."   

The two rate cuts combined should bring payment shock down from a 33 percent increase in August 2007 to 8 percent at current levels, Schultz noted.   

The Fed had faced heated criticism from some on Wall Street for failing to move quickly and aggressively enough to put a floor under an economy already beset by a deep housing slump once credit market strains erupted last summer. (Editing by Diane Craft)

 HDUPDATE 1-Juncker welcomes Fed cut, worries on FX rates      BYBy Anna Willard      WC517 words   PD31 January 2008   ET08:45   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds details throughout)   

PARIS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates was logical although a further widening in exchange rate differentials would hurt European exporters, Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday.   
   TDHe made the comments a day after the Fed cut its key interest rate by a half-percentage point as part of an aggressive effort to halt a sharp economic slowdown, a move that initially helped to boost the euro against the dollar.   

"The Americans are on the brink of a recession so everything must be used to try and limit the devastating effects," Juncker, who is also the Luxembourg prime minister, told Europe 1 radio. "It's logical for monetary policy to react."   

"Of course if the difference widened more, if it widened dramatically, we would have a level of exchange rate ... where it could become more and more difficult for the European export industry," said the head of the Eurogroup which comprises euro zone finance ministers.   

The U.S. central bank reduced the federal funds rate to 3.0 percent on Wednesday, its second cut in eight days. The ECB has so far refused to follow the Fed line, holding its rate at 4.0 percent as it focuses on inflation concerns.   

Juncker spoke shortly after France's junior minister for Europe, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, said he was concerned that the interest rate differential between the U.S. and Europe would further widen exchange rates.   

"There is a risk of finding ourselves at a level against the dollar that no European would wish for," Jouyet told LCI television. "We must keep an eye so that the interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic do not continue to diverge in such an important way even if the situation in Europe is not the same as in the United States."   

Asked to respond to Jouyet's comments, Juncker said: "He knows very well that the ECB does not have a foreign exchange rate target in itself."   

Juncker said the ECB was sticking to its main aim, ensuring price stability.   

French officials have repeatedly complained that the ECB concentrates too much on controlling inflation and not enough on promoting economic growth.   

Jouyet said ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet should "take these two elements into account in a balanced way".   

French companies say they are at a competitive disadvantage because of the strong euro and President Nicolas Sarkozy has translated these complaints into a criticism of ECB policy.   

German officials have also joined in. The German Finance Ministry said in a monthly report on Thursday that Germany's economy was in "robust shape" but a further appreciation of the euro could dampen the export sector in coming months.   

Trichet has doggedly stuck to his message of ensuring price stability, saying last Friday that a rate cut was not needed to boost growth. (Editing by Crispian Balmer; editing by David Stamp)

 HDANALYSIS-Bunds recovery vs Treasuries not seen until Q2      BYBy George Matlock and Jamie McGeever      WC836 words   PD31 January 2008   ET16:58   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPLONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bonds will continue to offer investors more attractive rates of return than U.S. Treasuries for several weeks yet, a trend analysts reckon may only start to reverse in the second quarter of the year.   

By then, a large chunk of the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts will likely have been delivered or discounted, while the European Central Bank may just have started or be about to begin its own easing cycle.   
   TDIn essence, Treasuries will be so expensive that it will be attractive to bond investors to liquidate these holdings and park the proceeds, or some of them at least, into euro debt.   

"The second quarter offers the break point, with the conclusion that the Fed has cut rates enough," said Jason Simpson, bonds strategist at ABN AMRO in London.   

"I reckon investors should start selling U.S. Treasuries and buying Bunds when the 2-year note yield falls to 1 or 1.5 percent. For the 10-year T-Note that would be 3 percent."   

A bond's yield moves inversely to its price.   

In London trade on Thursday two-year and ten-year U.S. yields stood at around 2.10 percent <US2YT=RR> and 3.60 percent <US10YT=RR>, respectively.   

Simpson expects the Fed to lower benchmark borrowing costs to 2.5 percent by the end of June, while financial markets expect them to come down to 2.25 percent or below.   

The Fed has already slashed U.S. interest rates by 225 percentage points since September, the latest 50 basis points on Wednesday, to ward off the threat of recession from decline in the U.S. housing market and its impact on the global financial system.   

The first estimate of fourth quarter U.S. growth on Wednesday showed the world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of only 0.6 percent. That's sharply down from 4.9 percent in the previous three months, half the consensus estimate and why overall growth in 2007 was its slowest since 2002.   

This weak U.S. growth sentiment should weigh on investors for a few months yet. But then Europe comes under the spotlight.   

"U.S. bonds will continue to outperform for some months, across the yield curve too. But in four to eight weeks it will start to change," said Padhraic Garvey, head of investment grade strategy at ING in Amsterdam.   

EUROPE NEXT?   

The International Monetary Fund this week lowered its 2008 U.S. growth forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 1.5 percent. But it also cut its projection for euro zone growth by half a percentage point to a broadly similar 1.6 percent.   

While futures markets are discounting further Fed easing, they only expect the ECB to cut rates by a quarter percentage point by June and again in the second half of the year to 3.5 percent.   

The ECB's steadfast stance on rates and repeated signals it's in no hurry to ease policy for fear of stoking inflation expectations has cushioned the recent fall in euro zone yields.   

Figures on Thursday showed that consumer price inflation in the euro zone rose to its highest level on record this month of 3.2 percent.   

Nathalie Fillet, senior rates strategist at  BNP Paribas in London, reckons data like that make it less likely the ECB will even cut rates this year at all.   

If it doesn't, it may be difficult for U.S.-euro zone spreads to come back in the U.S. favour led by purchases of European bonds. Still, with the Fed likely to cut rates further, investors will be tempted to sell Treasuries at some point.   

"The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield could fall to 3.5 percent but there is really good resistance at 3.5 percent. If the yield falls below that, it is a sign to sell Treasuries. But it's unlikely to happen before the second half of the year," Fillet said.   

The difference between 10-year U.S. and euro zone bond yields has come in by around 20 basis points in recent sessions. But last week the gap stretched to 55 basis points in favour of Bunds, the biggest gap in Bunds' favour since late 2002 and marking a swing of around 100 basis points in the last six months.   

The shift in shorter-dated yield spreads, which are more responsive to interest rate moves and expectations, has been even more dramatic.   

Two-year euro zone government debt last week yielded around 140 basis points more than comparable U.S. paper, also the widest gap since late 2002 and marking a swing of 200 basis points since the middle of last year.   

That spread has also hemmed in over recent sessions, to around 125 basis points on Thursday.

 HDInvestors Want More  Interest Rate  Cuts      BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER      CRAP Economics Writer   WC791 words   PD31 January 2008   ET11:54   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, criticized last year for being too tentative in cutting interest rates, has shown he can act boldly. But the Fed's two aggressive rate cuts in the past eight days have left investors demanding still more.   

That may be a sign of how much trouble the economy is facing, with many analysts contending that the country is flirting with a recession and may, in fact, already be in one.   
   TDThe Fed announced Wednesday that it was cutting its federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, by a half-point, double the quarter-point cut that many economists had been expecting. That move followed on the heels of a reduction last week in the funds rate of three-quarters of a point, which had been the biggest single rate cut in more than two decades.   

Initially, the Dow Jones industrial average was up by more than 200 points after the Fed announcement, but then investors pulled back and the Dow finished the day down 37.47 points, indicating lingering worries about the economy.   

All the changes mean that the funds rate, which stood at 5.25 percent in early September before the Fed started cutting rates, now is at 3 percent. The Fed is hoping the lower rates will stimulate the economy through increased borrowing by consumers and businesses.   

While Bernanke and his Fed colleagues were criticized last year for giving the appearance that they were cutting rates only grudgingly, the January rate cuts have signaled that the Fed is in full-blown crisis mode.   

The 1.25 percentage point reduction in the funds rate in just over a week is unprecedented in recent memory. The Fed hasn't been that aggressive about cutting the funds rate since the early 1980s, when then-Chairman Paul Volcker was reversing a tightening cycle that had driven interest rates to the highest levels since the Civil War in a successful effort to break the back of a decade-long bout of inflation.   

In its statement Wednesday, Fed officials said its string of rate cuts "should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity."   

Analysts saw that language as an effort to tell markets that just because the Fed slashed rates in January, such bold actions should not be expected in the future. But those words could very well fall on deaf ears.   

"The markets felt the Fed had fallen behind the curve. That caused a loss of credibility," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors. "Once the Fed loses credibility, it can be hard to regain it."   

Investors are already betting that there are more rate cuts to come. A futures contract tied to the federal funds rate is projecting that rate could get down as low as 2 percent this summer.   

The Fed's next meeting is March 18 and that will be followed by meetings in April and June. Many analysts said the Fed could trim the funds rate by a series of quarter-point moves during that time period, especially if the economic data remains weak.   

The government reported Wednesday that the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at a barely discernible 0.6 percent rate in the October-December period. The fear of some economists is that the GDP rate could slip into negative territory in the current quarter. By one definition, a recession occurs when the GDP is negative for two consecutive quarters.   

While the Fed is not publicly forecasting a recession, Bernanke and other officials have said they expect to see a period of slow growth, reflecting the impact of the severe housing slump and the credit squeeze which hit last August.   

"Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households," the Fed said in explaining Wednesday's rate cut.   

"The Federal Reserve is obviously very nervous about what is going on in the financial system and the housing market," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at  Moody's Economy.com.   

While Fed officials were widely viewed as being slow to react last fall, analysts said they are now making up lost ground.   

"The Fed misjudged the problems in the economy and the financial system through the Fed's December meeting. They just underestimated what was going on," Zandi said. "But I think they caught up in January and now they are fully engaged."   

Zandi predicted a series of quarter-point rate cuts at upcoming meetings, but he said if the financial system begins to unravel, the Fed will return to more aggressive half-point rate reductions.

   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Gold and platinum prices eased off record highs Tuesday as traders cashed in on profits ahead of an expected interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.   

Silver hit its highest level in almost 30 years and agricultural futures settled mixed.   
   TDThe Fed opened its two-day meeting with many investors anticipating a one-half percentage point cut to 3 percent when the meeting wraps up Wednesday. The central bank made an emergency three-quarter-point cut last week in hopes of jump-starting the faltering U.S. economy.   

Another rate reduction could further undermine the dollar and boost the appeal of precious metals as a safe asset in times of economic turmoil.   

A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated commodities more attractive to investors, particularly overseas buyers.   

The euro fell against the dollar in late trading Tuesday, fetching $1.4774.   

"A lot of this stems from what's going to happen tomorrow with the Federal Reserve and the dollar," said David Beahm, a precious metals analyst at  Blanchard and Co. Inc. "Who knows, they may surprise us again."   

A rate cut of more than one-half percentage point could push gold to $1,000 an ounce by February, he said.   

Gold for April delivery surged to a record $939 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, easily eclipsing Monday's record of $929.80. Traders cashed in on the high prices, and gold settled at $930.80, down $2.   

Still, when adjusted for inflation, gold remains well below its all-time highs in 1980. An ounce of gold at $940 then would be worth about $2,400 today.   

April platinum prices jumped to a record $1,734.90 an ounce on the Nymex before falling $6.80 to close at $1,721.90. March silver climbed to $16.905, it highest level since 1980, before settling at $16.80, up 5 cents.   

March copper gained 10.9 cents to end at $3.2990 an ounce.   

Supporting precious metals prices were continued supply disruptions in South Africa, a leading supplier of gold and platinum. Several major mining companies, including AngloGold Ahsanti Ltd.,  Gold Fields Ltd. and  Harmony Gold Mining Co., were forced to halt operations Friday because of a national electricity shortage, ceasing production at some of the world's largest mines.   

Two of the mining companies said Tuesday they plan to resume work soon. South Africa is the world's leading platinum producer and is second only to China in world gold production.   

Oil futures ended an erratic session higher as investors weighed predictions for a Fed rate cut and expectations that OPEC will keep production steady.   

Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose 65 cents to settle at $91.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling as low as $90.33 earlier.   

Agricultural futures settled mixed Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.   

Wheat for March delivery fell 19 cents to $9.44 a bushel and March corn dropped 1.25 cent to $5.01 a bushel. March oats gained 1.25 cent to $3.2425 a bushel, while March soybeans rose 13 cents to $12.6675 a bushel.

 HDTelecom stocks trade slightly lower after Fed cuts interest rates for second time this month      WC239 words   PD30 January 2008   ET20:41   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Shares of some of the biggest telecommunications companies were trading slightly lower Wednesday -- though some erased bigger losses from earlier in the day -- after the Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate for the second time this month to give the lagging U.S. economy a boost.   

As expected, the Federal Reserve cut federal funds rate by a one half of a percentage point to 3 percent. The Fed had also cut rates last Tuesday, by three-quarters of a percentage point, following a global sell-off of stocks a day earlier amid concerns over a possible recession in the U.S.   
   TDShares of  Sprint Nextel Corp. were down as much as 6 percent earlier Wednesday, but after the rate cut the stock regained much of those losses.   

Still, shares of the top three U.S. telecom carriers --  AT&T, Verizon and Sprint -- have declined overall since the start of the year, in part hurt by investor worries over the economic slowdown.   

Here is how some key telecom stocks were performing Wednesday afternoon:   

AT&T Inc., up 5 cents to $37.94   

Sprint Nextel Corp., down 22 cents to $10.58   

Verizon Communications Inc., down 11 cents to $38.60   

Embarq Corp., up 9 cents to $45.24   

Qwest Communications International Inc., up 4 cents to $5.88

 HDWall Street mostly higher as  Federal Reserve  starts 2-day meeting on interest rates      BYBy JOE BEL BRUNO      CRAP Business Writer   WC1,044 words   PD29 January 2008   ET23:41   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Wall Street advanced sharply Tuesday as the Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting expected to bring another interest rate cut to revitalize the U.S. economy.   

The Fed's rate decision is clearly the market's focus this week, and trading has been marked by investors' conjectures about policymakers' thoughts on the weak economy and crunched financial industry. With an announcement not expected until Wednesday afternoon, the market in the meantime digested data on earnings, consumer spending and durable goods.   
   TDInvestors did get some encouragement about the economy after the Commerce Department said orders for big-ticket items rose 5.2 percent in December, the widest jump in five months. In addition, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence fell in January -- pretty much as expected.   

Economic data will continue to be scrutinized as investors try to determine what the Fed's take is on the economy. Investors are angling for a half-point cut following an emergency three-quarter-point cut last week.   

"The market is just in a holding pattern," said Todd Leone, managing director of equity trading at Cowen & Co. "It seems we've hit a short-term bottom, and the market has been stabilizing as we wait to hear what the Fed says."   

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 96.41, or 0.78 percent, to 12,480.30. The blue chip index closed near its high of the day.   

Broader indexes also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.34, or 0.62 percent, to 1,362.30, and the Nasdaq composite advanced 8.15, or 0.35 percent, to 2,358.06.   

Government bond prices fell as stocks rose, indicating that investors feel less need for the safety of Treasurys. The 10-year Treasury note's yield, which moves opposite its price, was at 3.66 percent, up from 3.58 percent late Monday, and rose to 3.68 percent in after-hours trading.   

The dollar was mixed against most major currencies, and gold prices fell.   

Oil prices moved higher as traders waited to see what the Fed's next move will be. A barrel of light sweet crude rose 65 cents to $91.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   

Wall Street has been extremely volatile in recent weeks amid fears of a U.S. recession and further write-downs in the financial sector. However, that has given way to a more quiet tone this week as investors looked for their second-straight day of gains before the Fed's decision.   

Central bankers are widely expected to lower its key rate, now at 3.5 percent, by as much as one-half percentage point to 3 percent when policymakers wrap up on Wednesday. This will be the last meeting for seven weeks, but that doesn't rule out another emergency cut in the meantime.   

Rate cuts are just one part of the central bank's plan to boost the economy. The Fed auctioned $30 billion in funds to commercial banks on Tuesday -- the fourth time since last month it has provided cash-strapped banks with extra reserves.   

The auction is designed to keep banks lending and prevent a severe credit squeeze from pushing the country into a recession. Global banks have lost about $141 billion since the credit crisis began last year.   

But, all of this has done little to convince investors that Wall Street will return to the high levels seen in October anytime soon. Since most investors have priced in a rate cut, the market might still continue to trend lower until the economy shows signs the Fed's policy is working, analysts said.   

"It is going to take a little time, and one thing people have to realize is that sometimes consolidation is healthy because the market can't run forever," said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. "Since October we've been worried about slower growth and rising inflation, and right now we're in a haze."   

Consolidation over the past three months has certainly been dramatic. The Dow is down about 12 percent, or more than 1,700 points; the S&P has plunged 13 percent, or about 204 points; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has lost about 507 points, or 18 percent.   

Larson also said the market is scrutinizing corporate earnings, and what chief executives say about 2008. As American Express Co.'s fourth-quarter results indicated Monday, companies are being forced to prepare for a climate throughout 2008 of deteriorating credit and slower spending.   

AmEx, the world's third-largest credit card brand, said its fourth-quarter profit fell 10 percent after socking away more cash in reserve to use in case cardholders can't pay back their debt. Shares rose 40 cents to $47.80.   

In other corporate news, embattled mortgage lender  Countrywide Financial Corp., which was recently bought by  Bank of America Corp., posted a sharp loss, as expected, due to its missteps in subprime lending. Countrywide rose 36 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $6.31; BofA added 74 cents to $41.93.   

Search engine  Yahoo Inc. reported fourth quarter earnings Tuesday that beat expectations, but sales guidance for 2008 disappointed investors. Shares of the company fell $1.11, or 5.2 percent, to 19.70 in after-hours trading after it closed at $20.81 during the regular session.   

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.81, or 0.40 percent, to 705.20.   

Advancing issues led decliners by a 2-to-1 basis on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 4.07 billion shares, up from Monday's 3.96 billion.   

In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei stock average closed up 2.99 percent; Shanghai's key index added 0.87 percent; and Hong Kong's main index rose 0.99 percent. In European trading, London's FTSE rose 1.66 percent; Frankfurt's DAX rose 1.09 percent; and Paris' CAC rose 1.92 percent.

 HDGold futures hit record following Fed decision to slash key  interest rate    BYBy STEVENSON JACOBS      CRAP Business Writer   WC643 words   PD30 January 2008   ET23:11   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Gold prices soared to a record Wednesday after the Federal Reserve slashed its key interest rate -- a potentially inflationary move that undercut the dollar and boosted the metal's appeal as a stable investment.   

The Fed cut its benchmark federal funds rate by a widely expected half percentage point, following a bold three-quarter-point reduction last week that was aimed at staving off a U.S. recession.   
   TDFollowing the Fed decision, gold for April delivery surged to an all-time high of $942.20 an ounce in aftermarket trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It later pulled back to $935 an ounce, still up $4.20.   

Before the rate cut, gold settled $4.50 lower at $926.30 an ounce as investors waited to see if the central bank would cut by half a point or a more modest quarter point as some had expected.   

"The market has reacted to the cut. It had a powerful impact on gold despite the fact that it was broadly anticipated," said James Steel, a precious metals analyst at  HSBC in New York.   

The Fed's move lowered the funds rate to 3 percent. It marked the fifth time the central bank has cut the funds rate since it started with a half-point cut on Sept. 18 in response to the severe credit crisis which hit global markets in August.   

Lower interest rates can boost the economy but also depress the U.S. currency, raising the possibility of higher inflation and leading investors to shift resources into hard assets like gold.   

The dollar fell against the 15-nation euro, which fetched $1.4857 in Wednesday afternoon trading.   

Other precious metals traded mixed after the Fed's cut. March silver rose 13 cents to $16.930 an ounce on the Nymex, while March copper fell 2.95 cents to $3.2695 a pound.   

Also weighing on investors Wednesday was a report by the Commerce Department showing the economy slowed more than expected in late 2007. The economy expanded at a 0.6 percent annual rate, below the 0.8 percent pace projected by analysts polled by Thomson/IFR and well below the 4.9 percent growth seen in the third quarter.   

Gold and other precious metals are seen as safe-haven investments in times of economic turmoil. Gold increased in value by nearly 32 percent last year and breached the $900-an-ounce barrier for the first time this month.   

Analysts predict the metal could test the $1,000 mark before April.   

"I don't see anything stopping gold from going higher," said Carlos Sanchez, analyst at CMP Group.   

In energy markets, oil futures rose after the Fed decision. Earlier, crude futures fluctuated after the government reported larger than expected increases in crude oil and gasoline inventories last week.   

The Energy Department's Energy Information Administration said crude and gasoline supplies rose by 3.6 million barrels each during the week ended Jan. 25. Analysts had expected crude supplies to rise by 2.3 million barrels, and gasoline inventories to rise by 1.9 million barrels.   

Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose 69 cents to settle at $92.33 a barrel on the Nymex.   

Other energy futures also rose. February gasoline futures edged up 0.45 cent to settle at $2.334 a gallon, and February heating oil futures added 0.75 cent to settle at $2.5493 a gallon.   

Meanwhile, agricultural commodities traded mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.   

Wheat for March delivery lost 21.5 cents to settle at $9.225 a bushel, while March soybeans gained 9 cents to settle at $12.7575 a bushel. March corn fell 2.5 cents to settle at $4.985 a bushel.

 HDINSTANT VIEW 4-U.S. Fed cuts rates by another half point      WC2,151 words   PD30 January 2008   ET20:47   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve cut a key U.S. interest rate by a half-percentage point on Wednesday as part of an aggressive effort to halt a sharp slowdown in an economy hit by a housing slump and a credit crunch.   

Story: [ID:nN30192682] Text: [ID:nTRT000309]   
   TDChronology: [ID:nN12EDFUND] KEY POINTS: * The Fed's action takes the federal funds rate target to 3 percent, the lowest since June 2005. * The cut comes just eight days after it slashed rates by a bold three-quarters of a point. * The cumulative 1.25 percentage point reduction in the benchmark overnight rate in less than two weeks ranks among the most abrupt rate-cutting sprees in the modern history of the U.S. central bank. COMMENTS:   

AMO SAHOTA, PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, HIFX, SAN FRANCISCO:   

"This move is really designed to help financial markets even if it allows inflation pressures to pick up later on down the line.   

"The big challenge is going to be with euro/dollar and whether it has enough momentum to push up through its high and make headway into the 1.50s. The market may want to wait for the ECB and what it does with its policy decision."   

BILL O'NEILL, MANAGING PARTNER, LOGIC ADVISORS, UPPER SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY:   

"This is certainly constructive. It weakens the dollar and it tends to be inflationary, so this is a plus for gold. And I think it will help continue the upward trend that we've been seeing in gold. This is going to help all the precious metals and should help the copper market as well."   

"I think the gains in copper are probably exaggerated. But certainly we are going to have more stimulative activity. And the Fed left open the possibility of further rate cuts. That was very significant."   

IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK:   

"The Fed's statement does not say, but we expect to see in the minutes, that the Fed's new forecasts are much gloomier than in October. The statement repeats that there is downside risk to growth but drops 'appreciable' and says in addition that the policy action so far 'should promote moderate growth over time.' They are still ready to 'act in a timely manner as needed' but the hint here is that they think further easing will be much slower - markets permitting."   

DAVID GREENWALD, PARTNER, SCALENE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA:   

"I am a little disappointed by the 50 basis-point cut. I thought the Fed was a little more in control and was hoping they would show a litle bit of spine. But they seem to be bowing to the market. Now cutting by 50 seems like they're chasing their tails. Their actions have me concerned about their credibility. Because of that, the euro is nearing its all-time high versus the dollar. I don't think that's a surprise."   

"The Fed looks foolish. It seems they're afraid of the market. Everyone knows that it takes a while for 75 basis points to get through the economy and by cutting 50 now, I just think they're not leaving much room in the future."   

DAVID WATT, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO:   

"It's largely what everybody was expecting. I am somewhat surprised at the violent market reaction to that. People were expecting 50 basis points and for the Fed to leave the door open to more rate cuts. That's basically what they did. The reaction to sell the U.S. dollar seems to be a little bit of a suprise.   

"Even if (the jobs report) comes in weaker or negative, it's only going to be the first bad employment report. We are not getting any indications that it will necessarily be that weak. Initial jobs less claims have been fairly steady to a little bit lower, the ADP employment number was above expectations. It really doesn't look like we are going to see a bad jobs report. The Q4 GDP number was much lower-than-expected. Everybody seems to be extremely atuned to any indication economy might be slowing into a recession."   

KEVIN LOGAN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT, NEW YORK:   

"They're taking straight aim at the financial markets in order to calm down financial turmoil and create conditions that will help these financial institutions repair some of the damage they've endured over the past couple of months. What they're concerned about is financial markets and the solvency and of all these financial institutions."   

ART FRANK, HEAD OF MBS RESEARCH,  DEUTSCHE BANK AG, NEW YORK:   

"It is what many MBS traders were expecting, and at the moment we are tighter to swaps but not dramatically. It is possible MBS tighten more because in the longer term, lower rates make the CMO arbitrage better (via) a steeper yield curve, and there's hope that banks that aren't too capital constrained now have better carry on mortgages, so they might buy more MBS. It would have been a disappointment to the market if it'd only been 25 basis points."   

JEFF KLEINTOP, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL SERVICES IN BOSTON:   

"The Fed is demonstrating that they are getting ahead of the curve. Given that the weakness in the economy is stemming from the repricing of adjustable-rate mortgages, the Fed is pulling a key lever in liming the negative effects from that. The statement itself dropped the word appreciable from "downside risks" so maybe they feel that now, with this latest policy action, they have taken the worst-case scenario of a deep recession off the table."   

FRED DICKSON, MARKET STRATEGIST, DIRECTOR OF RETAIL RESEARCH, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO., LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON:   

"50 basis points basically placated both the stock and the bond markets. The Fed left the door open for further rate cuts, and the wording of the statement focused on their actions being targeted to the situation in the financial markets. Inflation didn't appear to be a problem, and the bias is still toward easing, with slowing growth in the economy the big risk.   

It's a convincing move, but expected. It's going to help ease the situation in the credit markets and in availability of loans to smaller business where there might have been some credit tightening. Whether it's enough to ward off a recession still remains to be seen. I think we'll have a better clue on Friday when we see the jobs report.   

Since 50 basis points was expected, I wouldn't be surprised to see some selling and profit-taking (in stocks) later in the day, and end of up flat on the day or below current levels."   

KEN LANDON, G10 CURRENCY STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN CHASE, NEW YORK:   

"They are not in panic mode. They are focused on the real economy, and they need to cut rates. Let's face it, they were behind the curve before and now they are trying to get to where they think they should be.   

"The dollar may be some downside in the short term but I think the market will start to reward future growth. At some point, the market is going to wake up and realize this is good for the U.S. economy."   

PETER BEUTEL, PRESIDENT, CAMERON HANOVER, NEW CANAAN, CONNECTICUT:   

"This is kind of what we have been expecting but a lot of people actually needed to see it. In my opinion, which is very petro-centric, this is both good news and bad news. The good news is that this may preclude a recession; the bad news is that this is pushing oil prices higher than they would otherwise be.   

"Many of the problems of this economy are caused by higher oil prices which are the underpinnings of an inflationary trend that is building. And while Congress is preparing to give people money in the form of tax rebates, higher oil prices, and heating oil prices and gasoline prices at the pump, take that money right back." [20080130 194728 GMT]   

JEFFREY GUNDLACH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF TCW GROUP IN LOS ANGELES:   

"The Federal Reserve is panicking and they have been panicking for the past 10 days -- we have gotten 125 basis points. It's too late to help the housing market. It is already stuck. The time to do this was back in August before you allowed a culture of defaults to develop between media saturation of upcoming reset problems and political grandstanding. If they had cut rates back in August, they would have avoided a certain increment of the housing problem but people have already defaulted."   

BILL HAMPEL, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.:   

"The financial markets would have reacted negatively if the Fed had only cut rates by 25 basis points instead of 50, although the Fed tries to resist such pressure. The other motive for the cut would be that the downdraft on the economy is strong enough to warrant a 50-basis-point cut. If we go into a full-fledged recession, which seems more likely than not, the fed funds rate will go down to 2 percent by summer which is a reason that the Fed is not cutting rates gradually. We'll know in a month or two whether we've slipped into recession and if we have, the Fed will want to cut aggressively."   

JOHN DERRICK, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES MANAGER, U.S. GLOBAL INVESTORS, INC., SAN ANTONIO TEXAS:   

"The Treasury market's reaction tells you the long end of the market, contrary to what the Fed says, is really worried about inflation."   

"This is very aggressive action of 125 basis points of cuts in about a week."   

JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES, GALENA, ILLINOIS:   

"I think the market had been discounting a cut of 50 points for the last couple of sessions. So this was not really a big surprise. It looks to me like it's lifted crude prices 20, 25 cents here after that news came out and some of that is in conjunction with a strengthening in the stock markets.   

"By and large, most of it had been discounted, but the wording within the report appears supportive to the equity markets and that is just spilling over into the petroleum market at the present time."   

MARK MEADOWS, A MARKET ANALYST AT TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON, D.C.:   

"The language in the statement was fairly strong, suggesting the Fed is still worried with the possibility of further deterioration in the U.S. economy. This move, combined with last week's cut should be enough for them to address some of these worries and they are probably done for now. The dollar is weakening as expected, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it rebounding later today or tomorrow."   

JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO:   

"The market got what it wanted. The perception that the Fed is being bullied by the market remains in place.   

"In my view the Fed is trying to address the banking crisis every bit as much as it's trying to address the economy. They want to make sure the banks have adequate liquidity and make a decent enough profit, and to keep credit flowing."   

TODD SCHOENBERGER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BROKERAGE, USAA INVESTMENT CO., SAN ANTONIO:   

"After analyzing this week's data, they had to cut 50 basis points, rather than to worry about another emergency rate cut. This will help the U.S. economy tremendously.   

Investors are thinking of moving back to equities if you could stomach the volatility. They were migrating into bonds for safety."   

TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITIGROUP FUTURES RESEARCH, NEW YORK:   

"Certainly the bond market saw this coming. It has been so widely anticipated it is hard to think of it as news.

 HDUS TREASURY OUTLOOK-Job, GDP data serve as Fed's open acts      BYBy Richard Leong      WC561 words   PD29 January 2008   ET20:55   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Traders will digest fresh U.S. job and economic growth data on Wednesday prior to a widely expected interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve following last week's hefty emergency move.   

Weak readings on job and economic growth would cement expectations the Fed will lower rates in the coming months, said traders and analysts who will be looking at the Fed's post-meeting policy statement for its intention to ease rates more.   
   TD"I don't want them to say they're over and done," said Thomas di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co. in New York. "If that's the case, you'll see a sell-off in Treasuries."   

Investors and traders hope that falling interest rates, together with a proposed $150 billion federal stimulus package, could forestall a U.S. recession.   

Some Treasuries selling already occurred on Tuesday in response to a surprisingly strong 5.2 percent jump in December durable goods orders. The jump supported a less dire outlook on the economy and led traders to reduce their bullish bond bets.   

Many traders still bet the Fed will trim its federal funds target rate by half a percentage point to 3.00 percent on Wednesday at the end of its two-day meeting.   

If this were to happen, the cumulative 1.25 percentage points of easing since last week would be the largest move in a two-week period since the Fed began using the fed funds rate as its primary policy tool in the early 1990s.   

There has been second-guessing among traders, however, whether the Fed may opt for a quarter-point cut.   

On Tuesday, the price on benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> was down 20/32 at 104-26/32. Its yield, which moves inversely with price, was 3.66 percent, up 7 basis points from late Monday.   

JOB, GDP DATA   

Prior to the Fed's rate decision and policy statement, the release of data on private payrolls from ADP and the government's initial estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product could either undermine or reinforce expectations of more Fed rate cuts, analysts and traders said.   

Signs of slowing growth, especially in the labor sector, will surely fuel speculation the Fed must do more to prevent the economy from contracting, they said.   

Even if fourth-quarter GDP beats a forecast for 1.2 percent annualized growth, it is crucial the Fed continues to lower rates because of downside risks from an increasingly shaky financial sector, according to Christian Menegatti, lead analyst at RGE Monitor.com in New York.   

"Positive growth is not going to deter the Fed from cutting rates by 50 basis points," Menegatti said. He reckoned that a U.S. recession may have begun in December.   

While a recession is still a minority market view, there has not much been good news to cheer about either, given weak data on the housing market.   

A report from  Standard & Poor's on Tuesday showed a record 8.4 percent year-over-year drop in home prices in November.   

"Housing will have nowhere to go but down," said Jefferies' di Galoma. (Editing by Leslie Adler)

 HDUS RATE FUTURES-Stocks jump pares ideas of big Fed ease      BYBy Ros Krasny      WC602 words   PD31 January 2008   ET22:24   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Updates prices, comments with stock market rally)   

CHICAGO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Gains in U.S. short-term interest rate futures were trimmed late on Thursday as a rise in U.S. stock prices cast doubt on the need for another round of big Federal Reserve rate cuts.   
   TDFutures <FFJ8> show a 68-percent chance for the Federal Open Market Committee to lower its fed funds rate by a half-point on March 18, down from more than 90 percent earlier but up from 46 percent on Wednesday.   

Selling picked up as the Dow Jones industrial average at one point jumped more than 250 points and other major U.S. indices surged to close about 1.7 percent higher.   

Traders were also taking some money off the table before Friday's monthly nonfarm payrolls report for January, which promises to be a big market mover.   

"The volatility pony continues to be alive and well," said Rudy Narvas, analyst at 4CAST Ltd in New York.   

Early strength in rate futures followed an unexpected spike in weekly jobless claims to their highest level in over two years.   

At the same time, though, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge showed price increases in December were still running higher than preferred by many policy-makers.   

Another half-point rate cut in March would take the federal funds rate to 2.5 percent from the 3 percent set on Wednesday, and a high of 5.25 percent before the FOMC meeting in mid-September.   

Futures <FFN8> show the fed funds rate falling to between 2 percent and 2.25 percent by mid-year.   

"I think the Fed will stop at 2 percent," said Kurt Karl, head of economic research at  Swiss Re in New York.   

Initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan 26 were 375,000 against forecasts of 315,000. Apart from weeks in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September and October 2005, claims were the highest since early 2004.   

Analysts blamed the week's jump, in part, to distortions from the Martin Luther King Jr holiday, which fell later than usual this year on Jan 21, and to poor weather conditions in the Midwest U.S.   

The Commerce Department said the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for December was 0.2 percent, as expected.   

That kept the year-on-year rate at 2.2 percent, likely high enough to make some FOMC voters queasy about extending the run of rate cuts.   

"Both core and overall year on year PCE chain price gains will likely remain above the Fed's 1.5 percent to 2 percent comfort zone for some time," said strategists at Action Economics.   

On Wednesday, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher voted against the central bank's rate cut, preferring that rates had been left unchanged for now.   

Of the dissents to four consecutive FOMC rate decisions since October, three have been in favor of tighter policy.   

The Fed's double-whammy rate cuts on Jan 22 and Jan 30 have driven the spread between yields on 10-year Treasury notes and 10-year inflation protected securities to about 2.42 percentage points from about 2.23 percentage points.   

"The Fed is now setting up unwanted conditions in the future, such as inflation, too much liquidity, and investors seeking way too much risk," said Dan North, chief economist at trade credit insurer  Euler Hermes ACI in Owings Mills, Maryland.

CHICAGO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. short-term interest rate futures shook off early losses on Wednesday after a weak reading on fourth-quarter growth that seemed to built the case for a large rate cut from the Federal Reserve.   
   TDProspects for the Federal Open Market Committee to lower benchmark lending rates by 50 basis points <FFG8> at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday rose to 80 percent from as low as 68 percent earlier.   

"No question the GDP number tells us the economy is on the brink of recession, if not in one already," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York.   

Real fourth-quarter gross domestic product rose by 0.6 percent, according to the government's advance estimate, below the median forecast for a 1.2-percent rise and matching the level from the first quarter of 2007.   

For the whole of 2007 U.S. growth was the lowest in five years.   

The GDP data offset news from ADP Employer Services that U.S. private employers added a relatively robust 130,000 jobs in January.   

The Fed lowered its target fed funds rate by 75 basis points on Jan. 22, to 3.5 percent, taking total easing since mid-September to 175 basis points.   

Analysts said current conditions suggested growth would not quickly bounce back in the first half of 2008, pointing to the need for more Fed rate cuts.   

"Because the housing decline and credit situation have intensified in recent months, the outlook for first-quarter growth is worrisome," said Steven Wood, economist at Insight Economics in Danville, California. (Editing by Andrea Ricci)

 HDAs US recession looms, yield curve looks prescient      BYBy Pedro Nicolaci da Costa      WC864 words   PD30 January 2008   ET19:52   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - When short-term U.S. interest rates crept above their long-term counterparts in 2006, many economists dismissed the long-held harbinger of recession thinking their crystal balls were busted.   

Other economic signals were flashing good times, so why was this sign of gloom making an unwelcome appearance? A solution emerged: dismiss the trend, and find reasons why things were different this time.   
   TDExcept they weren't. As a housing-led credit spiral has brought growth near a halt, it looks as though the interest rate tarot cards were right on the money.   

The U.S. economy expanded at just a 0.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, and for all of 2007 posted its weakest showing in five years.   

Until recently, though, the recent inversion of the yield curve had been dismissed as a fluke, despite four of the past five such episodes having preceded the last four U.S. recessions.   

So persuasive was the newfound consensus on the curve's waning powers as forecasting tool that The Conference Board, an economic research firm, gave it less weight when calculating its Index of Leading Economic Indicators.   

"There was this widely held belief that somehow longer-term Treasury rates were just artificially low, so the signal from the inversion was not viewed as relevant," said Keith Hembre, chief economist at First American Funds in Minneapolis, Minnesota. "Now we've got a pretty weak economic environment ahead of us, and a recession is likely this year."   

It wasn't just Wall Street that believed the yield curve's years of service as a recession indicator were due for a forced retirement. Both Federal Reserve Chairmen Ben Bernanke and his predecessor Alan Greenspan embraced the idea.   

"I would not interpret the currently very flat yield curve as indicating a significant economic slowdown to come," Bernanke said in his first speech to Wall Street as head of the Fed in March 2006.   

He was essentially repeating the Greenspan mantra, captured in what was perhaps the last of the Chairman's many famous catch phrases: the conundrum. In this view, unusually high savings in Asia and concomitant purchases of Treasury debt by overseas central banks, not the prospect of recession, was behind the anomaly in yields.   

Normally, lenders demand higher interest rates for longer-term loans. When the yield curve inverts, borrowers must actually pay more to borrow over short periods, depriving banks of a key source of profits.   

TRUSTY OLD CURVE   

In this business cycle, the inversion never relatively deep. At its November 2006 trough, the yield spread between 10- and two-year Treasury notes fell to about minus 16 basis points. In contrast, that differential was as deep as minus 50 basis points ahead of the 2001 recession.   

This shallowness bolstered the newly formed consensus maintaining that there was nothing to worry about.   

Yet around 18 months after a consistently inverted yield trend emerged, just the sort of time lag typically seen between a full-blown inversion and recession, the yield curve is showing its predictive powers are not to be messed with.   

"The whole thing is surreal. In the last four weeks the whole world realized we were going into a recession," said Richard Gilhooly, senior bond strategist at  BNP Paribas. "Our economists have been talking about it for a year and a half."   

To be sure, the economy has not yet contracted, though Wednesday's GDP data shows recent growth has been negligible at best. And, with unemployment on the rise and retail spending showing signs of exhaustion, many now believe the economy's fate is sealed.   

In fact, some investors including PIMCO fund manager Bill Gross believe the economy began contracting in December.   

By all accounts, a recession in corporate profits is already here. Under the weight of more than $100 billion in mortgage-related write-offs in the banking sector, Reuters Estimates now forecasts fourth-quarter profits among S&P 500 companies will drop nearly 18 percent, threatening to wipe out all of the gains in the three previous quarters.   

A decline in earnings growth in 2007 would be the first since 2001, a recession year when earnings declined 15.79 percent. Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at  Merrill Lynch, has noted that, even for the unbelievers of the curve's macro forecasting abilities, its hunch for a profits recession is foolproof.   

Not everyone is a convert though. Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich, says the curve's premonition may have been happenstance. He argues that the extent of the current financial crisis, which has brought the economy to a tipping point, was difficult to forecast. Nonetheless, he acknowledges it is a notable coincidence.   

"There will be some who will point to the yield curve as having been an accurate predictor," Stanley said. "Maybe you could argue that there were some people who were really pessimistic about the long-term outlook and they had it all right. I'm not convinced." (Editing by Tom Hals)

 HDUS RATE FUTURES-Chances rise for another 50 point Fed cut      BYBy Ros Krasny      WC363 words   PD30 January 2008   ET20:25   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP  (Adds details, analyst comments)   
   TD CHICAGO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. short-term interest rate futures rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered benchmark lending rates by 50 basis points and promised to "act in a timely manner" to address risks to the economy.   

 Futures markets fully price another 25 basis point rate cut from the Fed at its March 18 meeting <FFJ8>, and as much as a 52-percent chance of another 50 basis point reduction.   

 Before the end of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting futures had leaned toward a 25 basis point cut in March but showed no chance of another 50 basis point cut.   

 Wednesday's move took the benchmark fed funds rate to 3 percent from 5.25 percent when the easing cycle started in mid-September, the most rapid reduction since 1989.   

 In comments accompanying the rate cut, the Fed noted that financial markets remain under considerable stress.   

 "This is consistent with (Chairman Ben) Bernanke's concern about the feedback loop from the financial markets to the real economy," said Marc Chandler, strategist at  Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.   

 Wednesday's FOMC vote followed the release of fourth-quarter GDP data showing growth at the end of 2007 was weaker than expected.   

 Given ongoing problems in the credit and housing markets, many forecasters expect growth to stay soft at least during the first half of 2008.   

 Futures <FFN8> see the fed funds rate by mid-year dropping to 2.25 percent.   

 "If we go into a full-fledged recession, which seems more likely than not, the fed funds rate will go down to 2.0 percent by summer," said Bill Hampel, chief economist at the National Credit Union Association in Washington.   

 Still, the FOMC statement dropped the word "appreciable" from its assessment of downside risks to the economy, suggesting to some that the rate cutting cycle could end sooner rather than later.

CHICAGO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Expectations for another aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate cut this week wavered on Tuesday after stronger than expected readings on consumer confidence and durable goods orders.   
   TDIn short-term rate futures <FFG8>, the implied chances for a 50 basis point rate at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting dipped as low as 60 percent from 86 percent on Monday.   

The FOMC starts a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday to mull its next move after an emergency rate cut on Jan 22 that slashed the benchmark federal funds rate to 3.5 percent from 4.25 percent.   

Selling in futures picked up after January's reading on consumer confidence was a shade above expectations and the December measure was revised upward.   

The index for January was 87.9 against the forecast 87.5, and December's measure was raised to 90.6 from 88.6, the Conference Board reported.   

"This is not the kind of data recessions are made of," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut.   

Still, some analysts focused on the "expectations" index in the report, which fell to 69.6 from 75.8.   

"The expectations index is consistent with real spending grinding almost to a halt in year-on-year terms," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.   

Earlier, the Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods, or big-ticket items expected to last for several years, rose by 5.2 percent in December, well above the consensus forecast for a 1.5-percent gain.   

Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business investment, rose by 4.4 percent, also much more than forecast and its first increase since September.   

"After several months of sluggishness, durable goods orders ended the year on a very strong note suggesting industrial demand continues to hold up," said Anna Piretti, economist at  BNP Paribas in New York.   

Taken together, the reports cast some doubt on whether the Fed needs to "go big" again this week.   

If the Fed cuts by 50 basis points on Wednesday, the cumulative 125 basis points of easing would be biggest move in a two-week period since the U.S. central bank began using the fed funds rate as its primary policy tool in the early 1990s.   

Since mid-September the FOMC has lowered rates by a total of 175 basis points.   

Dealers anticipate further rate cuts from the Fed over the next few months. By mid-year <FFN8> futures are projecting a fed funds rate between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent.

   LPLONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The interbank cost of borrowing dollars fell sharply on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve delivered yet another hefty interest rate cut to try and prevent slowing growth from turning into recession.   

As expected, the Fed lowered its key fed funds target rate half a percentage point to 3 percent on Wednesday, meaning it has slashed benchmark borrowing costs 225 basis points since September.   
   TDThree-month dollar Libor fell to 3.11188 percent from 3.23938 percent on Wednesday <USD3MFSR=> while one-month dollar rates fell to 3.14375 percent from 3.26375 percent <USD1MFSR=>, according to the British Bankers Association's daily fixing.   

But the fall in euro and sterling Libor was much more modest.   

Three-month euro Libor was fixed at 4.37750 percent from 4.38313 percent <EUR3MFSR=> on Wednesday and one-month euro Libor was fixed at 4.19250 percent compared with 4.19375 percent <EUR1MFSR=>.   

Concerted central bank action and growing expectations of a European Central Bank rate cut had pushed euro Libor down over the past month but hopes for an imminent move from the ECB has receded on hawkish talk by policymakers and elevated inflation levels.   

Three-month sterling rates fell a point to 5.58 percent <GBP3MFSR=> and one-month rates were at 5.56750 percent <GBP1MFSR=> from 5.57250 percent.

 HDUS RATE FUTURES-Confident of another 50 bps Fed cut      BYBy Ros Krasny      WC345 words   PD31 January 2008   ET14:38   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited

CHICAGO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. short-term interest rate futures extended gains on Thursday after weekly jobless claims spiked unexpectedly to the highest in over two years.   
   TDAt the same time, the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge continued to show prices running above the level preferred by many policy-makers in December.   

Futures <FFJ8> now show about a 90-percent implied chance that the Fed will slash benchmark rates by another 50 basis points in March, up from 40 percent late on Wednesday.   

Another half-point rate cut would take the federal funds rate down to 2.5 percent.   

"I think the Fed will stop at 2 percent," said Kurt Karl, head of economic research at  Swiss Re in New York.   

Initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 26 were 375,000 against forecasts of 315,000. Apart from weeks in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September and October 2005, claims were the highest since early 2004.   

Analysts blamed the jump, in part, on distortions from last Monday's Martin Luther King Jr holiday, which fell later than usual this year, and to poor weather in the U.S. Midwest.   

Still, "with continued claims still showing a drift higher, there is nothing concrete to refute the Fed communique suggestions of 'some softening' in labor markets," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut.   

The Commerce Department said the core personal consumption expenditures price index for December was 0.2 percent, as expected. That kept the year-on-year rate at 2.2 percent.   

"Both core and overall year-on-year PCE chain price gains will likely remain above the Fed's 1.5 percent to 2 percent comfort zone for some time," said strategists at Action Economics. (Additional reporting by Chris Reese in New York; Editing by James Dalgleish)

 HDASSET-BACKEDS-Better buying ahead of Fed   BYBy Nancy Leinfuss      WC487 words   PD29 January 2008   ET22:48   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Investor buying in the U.S. asset-backed cash and derivative segments picked up on Tuesday, as a highly anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut boosted the tone in the marketplace, traders and investors said.

"The market is a little bit optimistic at this point in front of the Fed. People have been bidding up the price of cash bonds, as well as the ABX, in the higher end of the capital structure," said one ABS trader.
   TDThe ABX is a synthetic index of U.S. home equity ABS tied to credit default swaps, used by investors to hedge their subprime mortgage risks.

Top-tier segments of the ABX 07-1 index finished higher on Tuesday. The "AAA" tier rose to 74.16, compared with 73.26 in the prior session, while the "AA" portion rose to 43.16, against 42.56 at Monday's close, traders said. The riskiest "BBB" slice held steady at 14, traders said.

Fed policy-makers began a two-day meeting expected to result in a half-percentage-point rate cut on Wednesday, following an emergency 0.75-percentage-point reduction last week to shore up an economy still reeling from the subprime mortgage crisis.

"The Fed cutting interest rates across the board by 75 basis points last week helped a lot and if they cut again tomorrow that's going to help tremendously with mortgage resets," said one bond investor.

The Fed has been heavily criticized by some on Wall Street for failing to move quickly and aggressively enough to put a floor under an economy already beset by a deep housing slump once credit market strains erupted last summer.

Still, a $1.5 billion securities liquidation of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were also the focus of market participants. Goldman Sachs was seeking bids for the securities, which will be sold by auction on Wednesday at 11 a.m., market sources said.

The upcoming auction follows a series of portfolio liquidations of distressed RMBS and CDOs over recent weeks. CDOs are repackaged asset-backed securities that typically own a variety of debt and are sold to investors in slices with different yields depending on the credit risk.

Banks have been taking the biggest losses on CDOs and other structured finance vehicles as rising defaults on U.S. home mortgages and falling house prices undermine their value.

Over the past two months, more than 50 ABS CDOs have experienced an event of default as a result of the credit deterioration in the market for nonprime RMBS, according to Moody's Investors Service. Under an event of default, controlling investors can either ask the trustee for an acceleration or a liquidation of assets. (Editing by Editing by Jonathan Oatis)

 HDFACTBOX-History of sharp Fed  interest rate  cuts      WC373 words   PD29 January 2008   ET23:36   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's three-quarters of percentage point cut to the overnight federal funds rate on Jan. 22 was among its biggest and most abrupt reductions in borrowing costs since the early 1980s.   

The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is expected to cut rates again at a two-day meeting concluding on Wednesday.   
   TDHistorical comparisons to rate cuts earlier than 1990 are difficult to pinpoint because the Fed shifted gradually over the 1980s to a policy of attaining a specified level of the federal funds rate, a process that was completed by the end of the decade.   

Since July 1990, the Fed has cut the federal funds rate by a half-percentage point 13 times, but never by as much as three-quarters of a point at one time until Jan. 22.   

Following are past instances when policy-makers have sharply lowered the federal funds rate over brief periods:   


 -- Jan. 22, 2008
    From 4.25 percent to 3.5 percent, a drop of 75 basis
points (a basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage
point)
 -- Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 31, 2001
    From 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, a decline of 100 basis
points.
 -- Dec. 6, 1991 to Dec. 20, 1991
    From 4.75 percent to 4 percent, a fall of 75 basis
points.
 -- Early September 1984 to mid-October 1984
    From a range of 11.75 percent to 11.5 percent to around
10 percent, a decrease of 175 to 150 basis points.
 -- Aug. 2, 1982 to Aug. 27, 1982
    From a range of 12 percent to 11.5 percent to around 9.5
percent, an easing of 250 to 200 basis points.
 -- April 1980 to mid-May 1980
    From around 20 percent to a range of 11.5 percent and
10.5 percent, a tumble of around 950 to 850 basis points.

 HDTREASURIES-Edge higher in Asia before Fed, data      BYBy Rika Otsuka      WC418 words   PD30 January 2008   ET05:24   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries edged higher in Asia on Wednesday as investors waited to see the size of a widely expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut following last week's hefty emergency move.   
   TD Many market participants bet the U.S. central bank will lower the federal funds rate by half a percentage point to 3.0 percent after a two-day meeting ending later in the day.   

 Last week the Fed slashed interest rates by 75 basis points, its biggest rate cut in a quarter century, to fight against the threat of a U.S. recession this year.  Some traders, however, trimmed their bets for an aggressive Fed move, now expecting a quarter percentage point rate cut after Tuesday's solid data on durable good orders in December.   

 Investors took a wait-and-see stance on Wednesday as a 25 basis point rate cut could prompt those who have expected more aggressive monetary easing to dump Treasuries.   

 At the same time, a less aggressive move by the Fed is likely to spark a stock sell-off, prompting investors to seek the safety of government debt.   

 "One cannot say that a smaller cut is negative for Treasuries and a bigger one is positive," said Akihiro Nishida, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "This time it's not that simple."   

 Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> rose 6/32 in price to yield 3.656 percent, down nearly 3 basis points from the previous day's U.S. trade.   

 Two-year notes <US2YT=RR> were unchanged to yield 2.291 percent.   

 Treasury 10-year futures <TYv1> slipped 1/32 to 116-16/32.   

 Besides the Fed rate verdict, investors were awaiting a post-meeting statement, the initial estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product and data on private payrolls from ADP Employer Services for clues to the Fed's monetary policy after this month.   

 "Few expect the Fed will stop slashing interest rates this month even if it delivers a half percentage point rate cut today," said Mitsubishi UFJ's Nishida.   

 The ADP jobs report is likely to affect expectations for the government's monthly employment data due on Friday.

   LPLONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries edged higher in Europe on Wednesday as global stocks fell after Swiss bank UBS stirred fears that the credit crunch was worsening and investors braced for a widely expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut.   

European stocks <.FTEU3> dropped after UBS reported an additional $4 billion in writedowns, lifting the total cost of its exposure to the U.S. subprime debacle to $18.4 billion.   
   TDThe market spotlight remained on the Fed policy meeting which ends today.   

Many market participants bet the U.S. central bank will lower the federal funds rate by half a percentage point to 3.0 percent after a surprise 75 basis point cut last week.   

Some traders, however, trimmed their bets for an aggressive Fed move, now expecting a quarter percentage point rate cut after Tuesday's solid data on durable good orders in December.   

Investors took a wait-and-see stance on Wednesday as a 25 basis point rate cut could prompt those expecting a more aggressive cut dump Treasuries.   

At the same time, a less aggressive move by the Fed is likely to spark a stock sell-off, prompting investors to seek the safety of government debt.   

"The two key drivers are obviously how deep, how significant the recession risks are and how far the Fed is prepared to risk the medium term inflation outlook to deal with the current credit crunch and the recession risks," said Robin Marshall, director fixed income NCL Smith & Williamson.   

"The focus tonight will be the statement in how far they signal they are sort of done for the time being. I'm sure they may want to leave the door open for more cuts but they may want to try and roll back expectations a bit that this is a blank cheque for financial markets," he said.   

A half a percentage point rate cut would lead to more steepening of the U.S. yield curve, strategists say.   

By 1007 GMT in Europe, benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> were 9/32 higher in price to yield 3.649 percent, down 3.3 basis points from late U.S. trade on Tuesday.   

Two-year notes <US2YT=RR> were 2/32 up in price to yield 2.270 percent, 2.8 basis points lower than in New York trade late the previous session.   

Treasury 10-year futures <TYv1> nudged up 1/32 to 116-18/32.   

"While we agree with the macro picture calling for further easing beyond today's meeting, it is really only sustained safe haven flows and further equity trauma that can even hold current yields in place," said Charles Diebel at Nomura International.   

"It may be that 2s hold while the Fed plays catch up but if market pricing is correct, the Fed still has a lot of work to do and against an uncertain backdrop and continued inflation risks, it may be that the Fed cannot deliver what the market currently prices," he said.   

Besides the Fed rate verdict and post-meeting statement, investors were waiting for an initial estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product and data on private payrolls from ADP Employer Services for clues to Fed policy after this month.

 HDSterling steady before Fed rate decision      WC312 words   PD30 January 2008   ET09:59   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPLONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Sterling held steady against the euro and dollar on Wednesday in range-bound trading before an decision on U.S. interest rates from the Federal Reserve later in the day. The pound was close to a four-week high against the dollar which it struck the previous session as expectations of a hefty Fed rate cut are increasing sterling's yield appeal.   

Sterling has also benefited from a sense that problems affecting the UK economy will also hit others.   
   TD"Over the last month or so, prospects outside the UK have deteriorated, and that accounts for the pound's appreciation rather than things improving in the UK," said Paul Robinson, currency strategist at  Barclays Capital.

At 0837 GMT the pound was trading at $1.9903, having fallen as low as $1.9335 last week <GBP=>. The euro was steady at 74.20 pence having traded as high as 76.13 pence earlier this month <EURGBP=>.   

"People overreacted to bad news in the UK. The situation is not as apocalyptic as people thought a month or two ago," said Robinson, although he added that problems will persist and the pound is likely to stay under pressure.   

Investors are still pricing in up to four rate cuts from the Bank of England this year. However, the pound's interest rate differential against other currencies has improved as expectations of rate cuts from the European Central Band and Fed have increased.   

Investors will look to UK mortgage and credit data at 0930 GMT for further clues on the outlook for the UK economy, but market moves are likely to be limited before the Fed rate decision at 1915 GMT, analysts said.

   LPLONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Sterling edged lower versus the dollar on Wednesday but remained close to the year's high before a decision on U.S. interest rates from the Federal Reserve later in the day.   

The pound earlier touched a four-week peak against the dollar but retreated after U.S. private sector jobs data came in stronger than expected.   
   TDHowever the pound stayed close to the high just below the psychologically key $2 level as expectations of a hefty Fed rate cut later in the session are increasing sterling's yield appeal.   

"There is a lot of focus on the Fed which is set to cut quickly, while it's likely that the Bank of England is not set to cut as aggressively as many initially believed, so the pound holds the balance of power," said Robert Minikin, senior FX strategist at Standard Chartered.   

At 1454 GMT the pound was trading down 0.1 percent at $1.9881, having touched $1.9949, its highest since the start of the year and well above the $1.9335 it fell to last week <GBP=>.   

The euro was up 0.15 percent at 74.33 pence having traded as high as 76.13 pence earlier this month <EURGBP=>.   

UK mortgage approvals fell in December to the lowest since 1999, data showed on Wednesday piling further pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates next week from the current 5.5 percent.   

But policymakers' room for manoeuvre is limited by rising prices. A survey showed inflation expectations reaching record levels this month.   

Investors are still pricing in up to four rate cuts from the Bank of England this year. However, the pound's interest rate differential against other currencies is expected to widen as expectations of rate cuts from the European Central Bank and Fed have increased.

 HDPOLL-Dealers expect another Fed rate cut in March      BYBy Tamawa Kadoya      WC581 words   PD30 January 2008   ET23:28   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street predicts the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy again in March but is uncertain about a rate cut beyond that, a Reuters poll showed after the U.S. central bank slashed key interest rates on Wednesday.   

A total of 15 out of 16 primary dealers polled expect the Fed to cut benchmark federal funds rate at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 18.   
   TDNine of those expect the Fed to lower the federal funds rate target by a quarter percentage point, while six firms see a larger 50 basis point reduction.   

Deutsche Bank was the sole primary dealer -- those that
deal directly with the Fed -- that expects the central bank to
   

hold steady in March.   

On Wednesday, the Fed cut the benchmark federal funds rate target by a half percentage point, as widely expected, to 3.00 percent, its lowest level since May 2005.   

It has now cut the fed funds rate by a cumulative 125 basis points in the past two weeks, the biggest move since the U.S. central bank began using the fed funds rate as its primary policy tool in the early 1990s.   

The poll showed dealers were almost equally split whether the Fed would ease or stand pat at the April FOMC meeting.   

"Overall, the tone (of the Fed's statement) suggests a willingness to continue easing if growth data continue to weaken," said analysts at UBS Securities in New York, who forecast rate cuts in March and April.   

"We expect policy to go on hold as the economy starts to pull out of recession in the second half of the year."   

The median forecast for the low in the fed funds rate for the current cycle was at 2.5 percent, unchanged from a previous poll taken on Monday.   

Interest rate futures fully price another 25 basis point rate cut at the March meeting, and as much as an 52 percent chance of another 50 basis point reduction.

 HDTREASURIES-Inch up in Asia on Fed cut, bond insurers      BYBy Naomi Tajitsu      WC599 words   PD31 January 2008   ET04:36   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Short-dated U.S. Treasuries inched up in Asia, supported after rallying on a decision by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the second time in just over a week, along with the possibility that more cuts may be in store.   
   TD Dealers said speculation of ratings downgrades to top U.S. bond insurers was also helping to boost bonds, after a cut to No. 4  FGIC Corp's credit rating stoked concerns that financial institutions who bought their insurance may have to write down billions more in credit-related losses.   

 The two-year yield inched towards a near four-year low hit last week, steepening the yield curve, as Treasuries were boosted on the view that credit woes were far from over, while the overall U.S. economy continues to suffer.   

 "The monoline impact is big," said a dealer at a Japanese trust bank, referring to the bond insurers. "The market's waiting to see what's going to happen next."   

MBIA Inc , one of the top U.S. bond insurers that has been hurt by credit problems, late on Wednesday said it had received $500 million in funding from Warburg Pincus as part of an earlier deal to sell a $1 billion stake to the private equity firm to shore up capital.   

 Market participants said Treasuries would keep their stride, with demand to centre on shorter maturities as investors flee to the safety of government debt as global equities slump on the view that credit problems will sting the U.S. economy, which is already on the verge of a recession.   

 Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. economic growth skidded to a near halt in the fourth quarter, adding to the argument that a recession is looming. A strong reading of U.S. employment released the same day did little to alter that view.   

 The benchmark 10-year Treasury <US10YT=RR> edged up 3/22 in price to yield 3.630 percent from 3.648 percent late in New York.   

 Two-year notes <US2YT=RR> were 1/22 higher to yield 2.138 percent versus 2.162 percent.   

 Thursday's move kept the short end of the yield curve supported after the Fed's decision to lower its main interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.0 percent -- hot on the heels of an emergency 75-basis-point cut only last week.   

 Early gains in short maturities expanded the two-year/10-year spread to 149 basis points, its widest since late 2004, as gains in longer-dated bonds have petered out on concerns that a lower fed funds rate may spur inflation at some point down the line.   

 A Reuters poll shows that 15 out of 16 U.S. primary dealers expect the Fed to cut rates at its next policy meeting in March, with nine forecasting a 25-basis-point cut, while six see rates heading 50 basis points lower.   

 Dealers said that the health of the bond insurers and the credit market along with economic data would hold the key to the Fed's next move, with some saying they expected economic conditions to worsen.   

 The market awaited figures on U.S. incomes and spending, as well as factory activity later in the session, which land before crucial non-farm payrolls and the Institute of Supply Management's monthly survey due on Friday.

 HDUS TREASURY OUTLOOK-Weak payroll data seen adding to gloom      BYBy Richard Leong      WC499 words   PD31 January 2008   ET21:58   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A weak U.S. payroll report on Friday could ignite a rally in the Treasury debt prices and solidify expectations that a recession is imminent, which would cause the Federal Reserve to keep lowering interest rates.   

Against the backdrop of this week's mixed set of economic data, investors have flocked into bonds from stocks whenever fresh news emerged on bank write-downs and downgrades of bond insurers, analysts and investors said.   
   TD"The market is reacting to bad news from financial institutions. That doesn't stop until housing stops falling," said Mustafa Chowdhury, head of U.S. rates research at  Deutsche Bank in New York.   

In this anxious climate, the payroll report could play the pivotal role in fueling the current bond rally. Benchmark 10-year yield which moves inversely with price fell 0.4 percentage point in January.   

"It's much more important than it usually is. Last month, it was pretty bad," Jason Brady, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said of Friday's payroll report.   

In December, employers added only 18,000 jobs in December, the smallest increase since August 2003, while the unemployment rate rose to 5 percent in the the biggest monthly increase since October 2001.   

Economists predicted job creation likely accelerated in January, but it is unclear on the magnitude of the improvement in the aftermath of this week's other labor figures.   

The ADP National Employment Report showed private jobs rose by 130,000, nearly three times more than forecast, but the government said first-time filings for unemployment benefits jumped to 375,000 last week, up from 301,000 the prior week.   

The median forecast on January payrolls calls for an 80,000 increase with the unemployment rate holding at 5.0 percent, according to analysts polled by Reuters.   

In addition to the employment report, weak readings on manufacturing and consumer confidence from the Institute for Supply Management and Reuters/University of Michigan, respectively, will justify to low yields on low-risk U.S. government bonds, Thornburg's Brady said.   

"Bonds are pricing in a pretty unpleasant set of circumstances," he said.   

This bleak picture will likely lead the Fed to drop its federal funds target rate further. In less than two weeks, the U.S. central bank has already slashed the short-term rate by 1.25 percentage points to 3.00 percent.   

On Thursday, U.S. interest rate futures <FFJ8> implied traders see more than a 50 percent chance of a half-point rate cut at its March 18th policy meeting.   

Among various Treasury maturities, two-year notes <US2YT=RR> were flat in price for a 2.17 percent yield late Thursday, while 10-year debt <US10YT=RR> was unchanged in price for a 3.64 percent yield. (Editing by Neil Stempleman)

 HDReport: Greenspan says likelihood of US recession is at least 50 percent      WC217 words   PD30 January 2008   ET13:59   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the likelihood of an American recession remained 50 percent, reiterating in comments released Wednesday that there were "few signs thus far that we are already in one."   

Greenspan's comments came in an interview published on German newspaper Die Zeit's Web site on the same day the Fed is expected to announce its second interest rate cut in just more than a week.   
   TD"While I believe the odds of a recession are 50 percent or better, there is as yet little evidence that we have moved into one," he was quoted by the newspaper as saying. "Recessions are characterized by discontinuities, often sharp changes in employment and production. With the exception of a few such events in the last three weeks there are not enough of them to say the regime has really changed. I think that it probably will, but the evidence says, it has not yet."   

Asked if the Fed, or any economic stimulus packages offered up the U.S. government, could help ward off any recession, Greenspan said likely not.   

"Global forces can now override most anything that monetary and fiscal policy can do," he told the newspaper.
