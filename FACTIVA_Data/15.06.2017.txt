   LPSwitzerland's central bank has blamed the strong Swiss franc for leaving the country trailing the eurozone's economic recovery and said it would keep in place an ultra-loose monetary stance that has lasted more than two years.

Thomas Jordan, Swiss National Bank chairman, pointed to the diverging economic performances and said the Swiss franc was still "significantly" overvalued. "The Swiss economy is growing but at a lower rate compared to the eurozone economy and the US economy, and inflation remains subdued," he said.
   TDThe SNB yesterday left its main policy interest rate unchanged at minus 0.75 per cent, a level set in January 2015. The option of a further interest rate cut remained open, Mr Jordan said.

His comments contrasted with the tone struck last week by the European Central Bank , which took a first small step towards scaling back its ultra-loose policy by saying it would not cut its record-low interest rates any further.

Since the global financial crisis of 2007-08, investors have seen affluent Switzerland as a haven in times of economic and political instability. But the consequent strength of the franc has hit Switzerland's export industries, especially sectors such as watchmaking that rely on domestic manufacturing.

In January 2015, the SNB jolted global financial markets by unexpectedly abandoning a formal cap on the franc's value against the euro. Since that so-called "Frankenschock" , the central bank has battled to prevent the currency's appreciation by intervening heavily in foreign exchange markets, resulting in its balance sheet expanding to more than SFr700bn ($717bn).

While Switzerland avoided falling into a post-Frankenschock recession and Mr Jordan said yesterday there were indications the economy was "on the road to recovery", its recent growth rate has noticeably lagged behind the eurozone .

In the first three months of 2017, Swiss gross domestic product expanded by 0.3 per cent, compared with 0.6 per cent in the eurozone.

The revival had "not yet taken hold in all areas of the economy" and utilisation of production capacity was "unsatisfactory", Mr Jordan warned. The SNB expected an inflation rate of just 0.3 per cent this year. It revised down its 2018 inflation forecast from 0.4 per cent, also to 0.3 per cent.

Some pressure has been taken off the SNB since the French presidential election. Investors feared fresh instability in Europe if far-right National Front candidate Marine Le Pen had won, which would have sent the franc even higher.

The likelihood of further Swiss interest rate cuts also has been reduced by the US Federal Reserve's steps towards normalising monetary policy, including this week's quarter percentage point interest rate rise.

The SNB worries, too, that negative interest rates are creating damaging distortions in the economy and financial markets.

Its latest financial stability report, also published yesterday, highlighted risks of domestic banks' exposure to the Switzerland's frothy housing market.

By Ann Saphir
   TDDALLAS, June 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should be cautious about any further interest-rate hikes, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Friday, just two days after he voted with the majority of his colleagues to raise rates for the second time this year.

"We should be very careful about raising rates and we should do it patiently and carefully," Kaplan said at a meeting of the Park Cities Rotary Club in Dallas, adding that he will need to see improvements in inflation, which has weakened in recent months.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen earlier this week expressed confidence that with the U.S. unemployment rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, inflation will rise toward the Fed's 2-percent goal over the medium term. Kaplan's comments suggest that her confidence may not be fully shared by all her colleagues. Kaplan also repeated his call for immigration reform, continued trade with Mexico and more global integration as ways to counter slow U.S. economic growth.

"I'd love to see our country make the right decisions on how we think about trade," Kaplan said, adding that running a trade deficit with Mexico is different from running a trade deficit with some other countries like China because trade with Mexico boosts jobs and competitiveness in the United States.

The U.S. also needs to "come to grips" with immigration reform, he said, because immigrants have historically been big contributors to U.S. labor force growth. (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

 SEMarkets   HDEmerging Markets No Longer Fear the Fed; Latest U.S.  interest-rate  increase draws a muted market response   BYBy Steven Russolillo and Saumya Vaishampayan    WC710 words   PD15 June 2017   ET08:31   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWho's afraid of the Federal Reserve? Not, it seems, investors in emerging markets.

The Fed's overnight \b interest-rate\b0  increase , the second this year, drew a muted response in early trading Thursday. In Asia, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped 1% and Korea's Kospi index slipped 0.6%; both remain up by double-digit percentages for the year. The U.S. dollar was broadly steady against major global currencies.
   TDAt the start of the year there were concerns that as U.S. interest rates rise, money would flow out of emerging markets . But the Fed's tightening has been gradual and well-telegraphed, and central banks in Europe and Japan have continued their loose-money policies . Combine that with investors' unceasing pursuit of high-yield assets, and the result has been a boon for emerging markets stocks and bonds. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, one of the biggest funds that invests in emerging-market stocks, has gained 19% this year.

And even though the Fed is now detailing plans to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet this year—which could push up long-term U.S. Treasury yields—many investors remain emerging-market optimists.

The Fed's current approach to shrinking its balance sheet "is like trying to empty a bathtub with a thimble," said Ashley Perrott, head of pan-Asian fixed income at UBS Asset Management in Singapore.

"If the economic data stays decent and the economic trajectory is as they expect it to be, then I don't think the rundown in the balance sheet is likely to upset other markets too much," he said.

Foreigners bought an estimated net $20.5 billion of emerging-market stocks and bonds in May, the sixth straight month of net inflows, according to the Institute of International Finance. This year's pace is on par with the average from 2010 to 2014, it said.

It isn't just the search for yield that is boosting the allure. Also helping: Resilient trade and economic growth for many emerging markets, including China, where first-quarter growth was rosier than expected.

The concern, however, is that the wave of money into emerging markets could just as easily recede, as during the "taper tantrum" of 2013 , when investors stampeded out of emerging market assets after the Fed indicated it could begin winding down its bond purchases.

This year's contrasting calm can be credited to better communication between central bankers and investors.

"Emerging markets four or five years ago were so worried about the Fed slowing asset purchases and entering a rate-hiking cycle," said Arthur Kwong, head of Asia Pacific Equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management. "But now that's not the case. There has been so much time and communication from the Fed that there are very few surprises anymore."

Sure, some large money managers are trimming their holdings. Goldman Sachs Asset Management said last week it has cut its exposure to emerging-market currencies.

Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week showed that fast-moving investors like hedge funds did little to change their bullish positioning on emerging-market currencies, according to analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.

"Hot money is always a cause for concern," said Dwyfor Evans, head of macro-strategy for Asia Pacific at State Street Global Markets. "We know that just looking at history of markets over the past 20 years, hot money is hot money by definition and doesn't stay in emerging markets when there are compelling reasons for it to move elsewhere."

But he added that low volatility  is typically a beneficial factor for emerging markets and the gains in risky assets for much of the year are still supported by the broader macroeconomic environment.

"I think it's only natural at this stage for investors to start thinking about how to protect themselves in emerging markets and risk markets broadly," Mr. Evans said.

   LPWall Street struggles with fall in financial and energy stocks as economic data show weakness in core inflation rate

US Treasury prices rose across the board while the dollar sank as the latest economic data fuelled further uncertainty about the pace of Federal Reserveinterest rate increases this year - even as the central bank looked set to raise borrowing costs yesterday.
   TDSharp losses for financial and energy stocks - as oil prices tumbled after the latest US inventories report - left Wall Street struggling to regain the momentum that took the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average to record highs on Tuesday.

Gold was a notable beneficiary of the slide for the dollar and bond yields.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury , which moves inversely to its price, was down 10 basis points at 2.10 per cent at midday in New York - the lowest since just after the US presidential election last November.

The more policy-sensitive two-year yield was 7bp lower at a one-week low of 1.29 per cent.

The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a weighted basket of peers, was down 0.6 per cent at 96.41, also a seven-month low.

The euro was up 0.5 per cent at $1.1275, while the dollar was 0.8 per cent lower versus the yen at ¥109.17.

Those moves came after data showed headline US consumer prices falling 0.1 per cent in May, taking the year-on-year increase down to 1.9 per cent from 2.2 per cent in April.

More importantly, from the Fed's perspective, was a rise of just 0.1 per cent last month in "core" prices, which excludes food and energy, that left the annual increase at a two-year low of 1.7 per cent, down from 1.9 per cent.

"From out of nowhere we have now had three months of unusual weakness in underlying prices, at the same time as the unemployment rate has plummeted below most estimates of its long-run sustainable rate," noted Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics.

"The first instinct of Fed officials was to attribute the weakness in core inflation to transitory factors, but three months of softness is a lot harder to ignore."

Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit, agreed, saying: "This weakness in the core inflation rate is becoming a growing headache for the Federal Reserve."

Other US data showed a 0.3 per cent drop in headline retail sales last month, a worse turnout than had been expected, although previous months' readings were revised higher.

Core sales, the so-called "control group", were flat on the month, also lower than expected.

"The longer we go without seeing growth and inflationary pressures the more the markets become less convinced about higher interest rates," said James Knightley, economist at ING.

"With little sign of tax reform and fiscal stimulus coming, the Fed will likely sound more cautious on the prospect of an additional hike later this year."

The US figures also helped push government bond yields lower in Europe, with that on the 10-year Bund falling 4bp to 0.23 per cent and the 10-year UK gilt down 10bp to 0.93 per cent.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 equity index was down 0.1 per cent at 2,438, after closing on Tuesday at a record 2,440.35.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which also set a record close in the previous session, was steady, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent as technology stocks continued to rally following the steep sell-off this week.

In Europe, the pan-regional Stoxx 600 reversed an early rise to close 0.3 per cent lower. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.4 per cent as sterling climbed 0.5 per cent against the weaker dollar to $1.2810.

Energy stocks were heavy fallers on both sides of the Atlantic as oil prices fell close to levels last seen in November. Brent, the international crude benchmark, was down 3.6 per cent at $46.96 a barrel.

US crude inventories fell 1.7m barrels last week, according to the US Energy Information Administration, compared with expectations for a drop of 2.3m barrels.

Gasoline stockpiles jumped by 2.1m barrels, a second successive big weekly increase.

But the drop in oil prices failed to call a halt to the steady appreciation of the Canadian dollar seen since the start of this week.

The US dollar was down another 0.2 per cent against its Canadian namesake to a four-month low of C$1.3208 as speculation continued to build that the Bank of Canada could be closer to raising interest rates than had previously been thought.

Gold rose $10 to $1,275 an ounce, its highest in almost a week.

 SEEconomy   HDBank of England Turns Hawkish on Rates; Officials on BOE's Monetary Policy Committee signal that their tolerance for rising inflation is wearing thin   BYBy Jason Douglas and Wiktor Szary    WC736 words   PD15 June 2017   ET13:12   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPLONDON—A trio of Bank of England officials broke ranks with their colleagues in June to push for an immediate increase in interest rates, one of several signals that the U.K. central bank has moved a step closer to withdrawing the emergency stimulus it put in place after last year's Brexit referendum.

The BOE said Thursday that a majority of officials voted to hold the central bank's benchmark interest rate steady this month at 0.25% but minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee's discussions showed officials are growing increasingly anxious about quickening inflation.
   TDThe unexpectedly hawkish stance initially pushed the pound higher, though by midafternoon it was down 0.06% against the dollar at $1.2745. The news comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday said it would increase its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25% and penciled in one more increase later this year if the economy performs in line with its forecast.

For three MPC members—Kristin Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders—intensifying inflationary pressures justified an immediate increase in the BOE's benchmark rate to 0.5%, a move that would reverse the quarter-point cut implemented in August.

The remaining five members of the panel, including Gov. Mark Carney, voted to stay put for now, citing uncertainty over the outlook for growth, the minutes record. One seat on the nine-member panel is currently vacant following the departure in February of Deputy Governor Minouche Shafik.

All eight officials agreed, though, that their tolerance for rising inflation is wearing thin. Officials had previously said they were prepared to tolerate a burst of rapid price-growth to keep the economy on an even keel as the U.K. began exit talks with the European Union.

But the minutes record their unease after annual inflation accelerated to 2.9% in May, well in excess of the BOE's 2% goal and the bank's own forecasts. They also noted the economy appeared poised to recover somewhat in the second quarter after a soft start to the year and that the labor market remained healthy.

"Overall, the degree of spare capacity in the economy appeared limited, but, at the same time, the inflation overshoot relative to the target could be more pronounced than previously thought," the minutes record.

With inflation accelerating and promising signals on growth, "there were arguments in favor of a moderate tightening in monetary policy," the MPC said.

The minutes of June's meeting contained other signals that officials are adopting a more hawkish stance on borrowing costs. A statement included as recently as May that interest rates could be cut as well as raised was dropped. Officials noted that domestic inflationary pressures in the British economy appeared to be intensifying. And they sounded upbeat on the prospects for exports and business investment to power growth while squeezed consumers take a breather.

Joanna Davies, senior economist at Fathom Consulting in London, said it is possible the MPC may raise the central bank's benchmark rate later this year to reverse August's cut to 0.25%. But she said she doubted such a move would be followed by others.

"With economic growth set to soften, we would not view any such move as a step on the road to policy normalization, despite the more hawkish tone of this month's MPC meeting," she said.

The minutes made no reference to last week's election in the U.K., which cost Prime Minister Theresa May her Parliamentary majority. The surprise result has raised doubts about Mrs. May's future as leader and her government's Brexit strategy.

Mr. Carney had been due to speak Thursday alongside the U.K.'s Treasury chief, Philip Hammond, at an annual gathering of bankers in London's financial district. But the event was canceled following a fire in an apartment block in London early Wednesday that left at least 17 dead.

 HDHow Fed hike will affect US consumers and overseas economies   BYBy CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER and ALEX VEIGA    CRAP Business Writers   WC1,315 words   PD15 June 2017   ET06:27   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2017.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — Credit card holders will soon pay more. So will people with adjustable-rate mortgages or home equity lines of credit.

But most would-be home buyers needn't worry. And auto loan rates won't likely change much. For savers? Rates should creep up, at least for the highest-yielding CDs and saving accounts, though on average they'll still pay a pittance.
   TDThe cumulative impact of another Federal Reserveinterest rate hike — its fourth in 18 months — will range widely for individuals and businesses with loans or income-producing accounts.

And the consequences range beyond U.S. shores. A series of Fed hikes generally means that overseas investors in search of interest income can increase their returns by shifting money into the United States. Higher U.S. rates also tend to cause an outflow of capital from developing countries that can ill-afford it.

The most immediate effects, though, are generally on borrowers in the United States. When the Fed lifts the short-term rate it controls by one-quarter of a percentage point, as it did Wednesday, it typically translates into a quarter-point rate increase for credit card debt and home equity lines, as well as for some adjustable mortgages.

Fed policymakers have raised their benchmark rate to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent and indicated that they foresee one additional hike this year, assuming that the economy remains on solid footing.

For someone with a $5,000 credit card balance who makes a minimum payment each month, the Fed's four rate increases since December 2015 equal an additional $700 in payments over the life of the loan, according to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

"That's where consumers are feeling it and are going to continue to feel it," McBride said.

But home and auto loan rates are another story: Despite the Fed's moves, they've barely budged since December 2015, when the central bank announced its first increase after seven years of near-zero rates.

Here are some questions and answers on what the Fed's moves could mean for consumers, businesses, investors and the economy:

___

Q. Why haven't mortgage rates increased?

A. Because fixed-rate mortgage rates don't typically follow the Fed's changes. Sometimes they even move in the opposite direction. So it doesn't necessarily make sense to rush into buying a home or refinancing a mortgage. The hike often won't translate into higher mortgage rates.

Fixed long-term mortgages tend to track the rate on the 10-year Treasury, which, in turn, is influenced by such factors as investors' expectations of future inflation to global demand for U.S. Treasurys.

In December 2015, a week before the first increase, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 4.06 percent, according to Bankrate.com. It actually fell for most of 2016, then jumped later in the year and peaked at 4.44 percent in mid-March this year.

But since then, long-term mortgage rates have declined and are back to almost exactly where they began: The 30-year averaged 4.04 percent last week.

Even the increase that began in late 2016 had little to do with the Fed. Rather, investors dumped Treasurys and bought stocks in anticipation of faster growth and higher inflation after Donald Trump's election. Better growth overseas also raised optimism.

But as Trump's tax and infrastructure spending proposals have stalled, investors' outlooks have dimmed. Demand for the 10-year Treasury has risen, and so its yield has dropped, reducing mortgage rates with it.

Other factors can also keep rates low. When global investors grow nervous, they often pour money into Treasurys because they're seen as ultra-safe. That buying pressure holds down Treasury rates.

___

Q. So where will home loan rates go from here?

A. Hard to tell. The Fed expects to lift its benchmark rate one more time this year and three times in 2018. Eventually, those increases should put upward pressure on mortgage rates, but it's impossible to say when.

Mortgage rates are still very low by historical standards. Before the Great Recession, the 30-year rate had never dipped below 5 percent.

___

Q. How could the Fed's actions affect other countries around the world?

A. Higher rates in the United States tend to attract more investment from overseas. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are still keeping their benchmark rates near zero to try to stimulate those economies. So investors can earn more by investing in dollar-denominated assets.

That inflow pushes up the value of the dollar, which can make U.S. exports costlier overseas. It can also pull money out of developing countries, where rates are usually higher but government bonds carry more risk. A flow of funds out of developing nations can lower their currencies relative to the dollar, making it harder for businesses in those nations to repay debts they have incurred in dollars.

___

Q. My credit rating isn't so great. How will I be affected?

A. Doug Amis, a certified financial planner in Cary, North Carolina, says consumers with less-than-sterling credit can expect to pay more, especially when financing the purchase of a used car.

"There's going to be an opportunity to increase those rates higher," Amis said. "So if you have poor credit, this is going to impact you."

Still, even with another rate hike, the impact on consumers and businesses is likely to remain mild, as rates remain very low, relative to years ago, Amis noted.

___

Q. Have the Fed's moves boosted the puny rates available for savers?

A. In a few cases, yes. McBride says some smaller banks are starting to offer higher rates on CDs and savings accounts than larger banks are. The huge national banks already have "more deposits than they know what to do with," McBride said, so haven't lifted their rates at all.

As a result, the disparity between the smaller local banks and nationwide institutions is widening, he said: "Exploit that difference. It's money in your pocket."

So far, the average rate on a one-year CD has barely risen since the Fed's rate hikes began, inching up from 0.27 percent in December 2015 to 0.35 percent now, according to Bankrate.com. But the highest-yielding CDs have risen from 1.35 percent to 1.5 percent.

___

Q. What if I'm a retiree invested in bonds?

A. Amis says he tells his fixed-income clients not to stress out over another rate hike.

"This is part of investing in fixed income, and it's not a signal to jump ship and go into dividend-paying equities," he said. "I would recommend they stay the course and earn the coupon."

Since rates began rising again, Amis has been advising retirees and others with fixed-income investments like bonds to ensure that their portfolios are balanced between very short-term and long-term bonds. Longer-term bonds typically pay higher rates, and as rates rise, the short-term securities will be replaced with higher-yielding ones.

By Jan Harvey

LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Copper fell for a fourth day on Thursday after the Federal Reserve lifted U.S. interest rates and took a more hawkish than expected stance on future policy, boosting the dollar and weighing on assets priced in the U.S. currency.

The dollar strengthened as expectations for another U.S. rate increase this year were kept alive by a policy statement that indicated huge emergency funds pumped into the economy since 2009 could be trimmed.

"The recovery in copper prices from the early May lows to the recent highs was helped by the weakening dollar," said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. "We see the dollar strengthening in the second half of this year. That should cause some headwinds for the metals markets."

Below-forecast U.S. inflation and retail sales data on Wednesday, coming hot on the heels of reports showing Chinese growth could lose momentum, had already reinforced concerns about the outlook for raw materials demand.

Overall, the outlook for Chinese growth will be the leading driver for copper prices, Menke said.

"The data we've seen this week in terms of fixed-asset investment, infrastructure and also property reflects the market's belief that we're about to see a slowdown from that side," he said. "That is something the copper market is (reflecting) currently."

* LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper did not trade at the close but was last bid down 0.7 percent at $5,661 a tonne.

* FEDERAL RESERVE: The Fed raised interest rates for the second time in three months and said it would start cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.

* COPPER STOCKS: Copper inventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses <MCU-STOCKS> fell by another 4,125 tonnes, exchange data showed, taking them to their lowest in more than six weeks.

* STEEL PRICES: Steel raw material zinc rose after capacity cuts in China drove up steel prices by 3 percent. LME zinc ended the day 0.4 percent up at $2,505.

* ZINC DEFICIT: The global zinc market deepened its deficit to 92,400 tonnes in April from a revised 72,700 tonnes in March, data from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) showed.

* ZINC STOCKS: Zinc stocks in LME warehouses <MZN-STOCKS> fell another 1,800 tonnes to 316,175 tonnes, their lowest since early 2009, exchange data showed.

* RUSAL: Russian aluminium giant Rusal said it plans to boost its production by 19 percent from 2016 levels to 4.4 million tonnes by 2021 amid rising global demand. Aluminium finished 0.6 percent down at $1,872.

* OTHER METALS: LME lead closed 0.6 percent up at $2,092 a tonne, while tin gained 1.4 percent to $19,500 and Nickel lost 1 percent to $8,850.

June 14 (Reuters) -
   TDSTORY: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, citing continued U.S. economic growth and job market strength, and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.

KEY POINTS:

The decision lifted the U.S. central bank's benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent as it proceeds with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade.

The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

COMMENTS:

KRISTINA HOOPER, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT INVESCO LTD IN NEW YORK

“This is what I expected – that the Fed would be in something of a hurry to get out plans for balance sheet normalization in advance of any changes in FOMC membership, but that we likely won’t see the start of implementation until the fourth quarter. And as I expected, the Fed will be slowly and carefully normalizing. What’s perhaps most noteworthy is that the Fed has taken its data dependent monetary policy with regards to the fed funds rate and extended it to balance sheet normalization – note the sentence in the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans:

MICHAEL PURVES, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST AT WEEDEN & CO IN NEW YORK

"When you look at the Fed statement and you think about how the recent data has been trending and you think about the market reaction, the core question is does the Fed really change their narrative aggressively. Not today so much but do we start seeing a much more dovish narrative going forward? Because it's going to be really hard to defend some of the things that they have put in this statement, if in fact the data doesn't start getting better soon.

"A couple of weeks ago (Fed Governor) Lael Brainard gave a speech that was very much of the view that we are not seeing the inflation necessary to really talk seriously about a balance sheet reduction any time soon. That, sort of more fringe narrative, is going to go mainstream.

JOE MANIMBO, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, WESTERN UNION BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, WASHINGTON

“The U.S. dollar cut session losses after the Fed raised rates... and signaled another rate increase before the end of the year. Ahead of the Fed’s decision, the broadly weighted U.S. dollar index had fallen to fresh lows for the year after disappointing news on the U.S. economy cast doubt on further rate increases. While the Fed noted the recent slowing in inflation that was evident in today’s consumer price index, the bank’s forecasts for the economy maintained confidence in its underlying strength. The Fed revised up slightly its forecasts for growth this year while it nudged down its predictions for unemployment and inflation. The Fed chair’s comments at the bottom of the hour are also likely to impact currencies. The Fed’s glass half full assessment of the U.S. economy should support the dollar. But if the Fed’s view should prove overly optimistic the dollar would be at risk of deepening its recent losses.”

HEIDI LEARNER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NEW YORK, SAVILLS STUDLEY, SAVILLS PLC

“The market should take confidence in the fact that they’re being very transparent in setting clear policy steps in terms of how they normalize the balance sheet. Certainly more transparency is a good thing.

“After this morning’s dip in CPI to 1.7 percent from 2.3 percent year on year at the beginning of the year, it would be hard for them not to adjust that down, the same thing about their changes to the unemployment rate, the dip down for 2018, 2019 has to reflect the fact we’re already at 4.3 percent.

“I would have liked to see some mention about the extent to which they’re concerned about the decline in inflation. That’s probably behind Kashkari’s dissent in terms in wanting to keep rates where they were, but they didn’t seem terribly worried.

“If you look at the fact that now we’ve had two rate hikes this year, you could argue we’ve gone from 2.6 percent in 10-year Treasuries, now down to almost 2.10 percent, so that 50 basis points increase we’ve had in Fed Funds has been equal to the decline in 10-year Treasury yields. So clearly the flattening of the yield curve here suggests maybe not as much growth or not as much tightening as would have been the case.

BRETT RYAN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, NEW YORK:

"The fact that they kept the interest rate trajectory the same is not surprising. Despite the weak inflation prints recently they are not reexamining or rethinking the path of rates just yet. We did get more details than expected on reinvestment tapering but they were in line with what we were expecting.

"They upgraded their level of concern about inflation by stating that the committee is monitoring the inflation "closely." To the backdrop, they lowered inflation forecasts in the summer of economic projections by 0.3 pct in the headline and 0.2 percent in the core. That sets a low bar to get to their forecast target by year-end. As long as your core PCE is on track to hit 1.7 percent, market participants should expect another rate hike by the end of this year.

"In terms of our forecast, nothing really has changed. We still think in September they take a pause. They announce implementation of taper. They could hike at that time, but we think they probably pause then and then hike in December assuming things go well.

"They did a good job communicating.

"The market is still underpricing 2018 and 2019 well below where the Fed thinks things are going to be in terms of rates.

MARK CABANA, HEAD OF U.S. SHORT RATES STRATEGY AT BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH IN NEW YORK:

“I don’t think that there is really too much new in here outside of the fact that the Fed remains committed to the slow gradual normalization process despite some of the weak data that we’ve had. It just looks like the Fed is sticking to their story and the market remains highly skeptical that the Fed is going to be able to deliver just based upon underlying data. I would think that at some point the market is going to be pricing in even greater risks that the Fed might be moving too quickly, and we’ve certainly seen some of that price action over recent days with yields falling and inflation breakevens moving lower, but for now it seems like the Fed is pretty committed to stay on their path.”

DAN IVASCYN, GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIF:

“The statement was slightly on the hawkish side. I think it’s just how Central Banks speak. I think that, more important, arguably today was the weakness of the retail and inflation data. As our economist pointed out, there’s a trend and signs of weakening in the harder data. There’s some pressure on inflation and we think the Fed is going to take note of this weaker data. The reality is that they are going to be data-dependent and we remain cautious on interest-rate risk, but we’re not massively selling bonds here. Be careful not to be bearish on this statement.”

BILL NORTHEY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, US BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT, HELENA, MONTANA

"The muted market reaction thus far I think that’s what is standing out to me.

“Notably as I’m looking down through the adjustments that were made … the PCE inflation expectations for 2017 have been materially ratcheted down from 1.9 to 1.6 percent. That’s notable because that indicates that the Fed is viewing that there’s less inflation in the system and would look at this as a relatively dovish hike.”

“To the extent that this is viewed as a materially dovish hike we could see a little bit more weakness in the dollar.”

“When you’re looking at lower levels of inflation and potentially a Fed that may have to take a somewhat slower path towards policy rate normalization that could allow rates to stay lower for a longer period of time across the Treasury curve and continue to provide more accommodation, things that have been positive from an equity markets perspective. Certainly valuations across the equity market complex are full at this time and aided by low interest rates and low inflation.”

KULLY SAMRA, UK MANAGING DIRECTOR AT CHARLES SCHWAB, SAID:

“An interest rate rise today was highly expected and shows the Fed continues to be confident in moving towards normalizing monetary policy. Despite recent underwhelming jobs numbers, the underlying US economic data remains robust enough to warrant tightening.

“While the economy is bouncing back from a weak first quarter, earnings have been strong and even in the wake of continued political uncertainty, corporate confidence remains secure. The market has demonstrated that it is comfortable with gradual rate hikes and will be reassured that the Fed has today committed to its promises. We expect at least one more rate hike this year but incoming data will influence future decisions.”

“The next step for the Fed will be to reduce its balance sheet and stocks could experience bouts of volatility in the coming months due to both political surprises and Fed policy communications. The bull market still has legs, but investors should be aware that risks are elevated.”

BRENT SCHUTTE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT IN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN

“This one was priced in by the market and even with the weaker inflation data today everyone still expected the Fed to hike rates because the market had given them the green light to do so. There is a lot of information also to digest in this one with the balance sheet reduction and some slight tweaks to the language. But in general the underlying economic backdrop, in my mind, supports what they did today. The funny thing is the retail sales data was actually decent. Everybody forgets to look at the revisions and if you look at the revisions for the last two months they were actually up quite a bit. So you have retail sales which actually now are additive to second-quarter GDP.

"Everybody is fixated on the inflation data and it is a little bit of a mystery. But in general you are at this point in the economic cycle where unemployment is, where qualified workers are hard to find. The textbook says that inflation should rise, the question is if this time is different. We still believe supply and demand works and because there is not much supply of labor and a ton of demand, wages will rise and the way companies will pay for those wages is through rising prices which will translate to rising inflation in the future.”

RICH TAYLOR, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT AMERICAN CENTURY INVESTMENTS IN MOUNTAIN VIEW CALIFORNIA

"The big takeaways were as expected. What is noteworthy is that today Yellen laid out the balance sheet reduction plan with a lot more detail."

"Obviously with the big drop off in inflation this morning, which was a bit of a surprise, and the recent softening of economic data in general, it certainly gave the Fed pause with regards to September."

"The market's not reacting much because the 25 basis point increase was widely expected."

"In the bond market we're still range bound. For investors it’s still a yield grab in the credit markets even though the credit markets are very expensive. Bond investors don't have to worry about significantly higher rates for quite a while."

"There's too many headwinds on the economic and geopolitical front to take up interest rates out of the recent range any time soon."

"We still think there's one more 25 basis point move, obviously data dependent but it might not happen until December if we continue to get soft inflation data."

BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT IN MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN

“The FOMC met expectations and delivered a dovish hike. It’s dovish in that they acknowledge the data has softened and they haven’t dismissed the weaker inflation readings as being merely transitory. While the base case can be for another rate hike this year, it’s not unthinkable that they could just pause until September or even December to get the “coast is clear” signal on inflation.

“The balance sheet reduction plan is so mild and mechanical that it shouldn’t be an issue for the longer-dated Treasury or MBS markets. They stormed into the room with QE and are tiptoeing out almost unnoticed.”

GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK

“Generally speaking this does seem like a more hawkish statement. The Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open (for) the start of balance sheet runoff, and the fact that they haven’t slowed their projected path of rate hikes suggest they can do both balance sheet and rate hikes at the same time.”

MARKET REACTION:

STOCKS: Stocks moved slightly higher then flattened. The S&P 500 was last down 0.2 percent after being down 0.06 percent just before the decision.

BONDS: U.S. Treasury yields briefly fall, then retrace and edge higher.

FOREX: The U.S. dollar index pared earlier losses.

“Generally speaking this does seem like a more hawkish statement. The Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open (for) the start of balance sheet runoff, and the fact that they haven’t slowed their projected path of rate hikes suggest they can do both balance sheet and rate hikes at the same time.”

MARKET REACTION:

STOCKS: Stocks moved slightly higher then flattened. The S&P 500 was last down 0.1 percent after being down 0.06 percent just before the decision.

BONDS: U.S. Treasury yields briefly fall, then retrace.

FOREX: The U.S. dollar index pared earlier losses.

 HDFed raises key rate and unveils plan to reduce bond holdings   BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER    CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,354 words   PD15 June 2017   ET00:21   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2017.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate for the third time in six months, providing its latest vote of confidence in a slow-growing but durable economy. The Fed also announced plans to start gradually paring its bond holdings later this year, which could cause long-term rates to rise.

The increase in the Fed's short-term rate by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and slightly better returns for savers. The Fed foresees one additional rate hike this year but gave no hint of when that might occur.
   TDThe overarching message the Fed sent Wednesday was an upbeat one: It believes the U.S. economy is on firm footing as it enters its ninth year of recovery from the Great Recession, with little risk of a recession. Though the economy is growing only sluggishly and though inflation remains chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target, it foresees improvement in both measures over time.

And the most important pillar of the economy — the job market — remains solid if slowing, with unemployment at a 16-year-low of 4.3 percent — even below the level the Fed associates with full employment.

The Fed's decision to raise rates, announced in a statement after its latest policy meeting, was approved 8-1, with Neel Kashkari, head of the Fed's Minneapolis regional bank, dissenting in favor of holding rates unchanged.

The announcement that the Fed plans to begin paring its balance sheet later this year — "provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated" — involves its enormous portfolio of Treasury and mortgage bonds. The Fed began buying the bonds after the Great Recession to try to depress long-term loan rates. That effort resulted in a five-fold increase in its portfolio to $4.5 trillion.

On Wednesday, the Fed said it would eventually allow a small amount of bonds to mature without being replaced — an amount that would gradually rise as markets adjusted to the process. This process could put upward pressure on long-term borrowing rates.

The Fed would start with monthly reductions in Treasury holdings of no more than $6 billion and $4 billion in mortgage bonds. Those figures would rise in increments over a year until they reached $30 billion a month in Treasurys and $20 billion in mortgage bonds.

"With the Fed stating its intentions to start reducing the size of the balance sheet this year, it is offering a clear vote of confidence for the economy," said Curt Long, chief economist of the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions.

Chair Janet Yellen was asked at a news conference whether she worried that the Fed could rattle markets once it starts shrinking its bond holdings. She said the central bank feels confident it can avoid "market strains" by detailing its plan far in advance and by stressing that the process will be gradual.

The Fed provided no date for the start of the bond sales but said that if the economy fares as expected, "we could put this into effect relatively soon."

The Fed also issued updated economic forecasts that showed it foresees one additional rate increase this year to follow Wednesday's increase and an earlier rate hike in March.

The rate forecast, based on individual projections from each member, envisions three more rate hikes in 2018 and three more in 2019. By then, the Fed's forecast would put its key policy rate at 3 percent. That's the level the Fed believes is a neutral rate — neither stimulating growth nor restraining it.

But the Fed's forecasts are only predictions and are frequently revised as its assessments evolve. Some economists suggested that even though the Fed foresees one more rate hike this year, the persistently low inflation may lead it to leave rates alone until 2018. Some also note that political paralysis in Washington has raised doubts about whether Congress will increase the nation's borrowing limit and pass a new budget. That possibility, too, could lead the Fed to wait.

Another rate hike this year is "becoming less of a sure thing as every month of data comes out," said Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Economics. If inflation doesn't pick up, he said, the Fed will find that raising rates and reducing its balance sheet is "going to be a difficult maneuver."

The Fed's revised forecasts reduced its estimate for unemployment by year's end to 4.3 percent from a March projection of 4.5 percent. Unemployment has already reached a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.

The Fed kept forecast for economic growth this year of 2.2 percent, up slightly from its March forecast, with growth of 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019. Those forecasts are far below the 3 percent annual growth the Trump administration has said it can achieve through tax cuts, deregulation and tougher enforcement of trade rules to protect American jobs.

The central bank updated its inflation projections to take account of a slowdown. It forecast that prices will rise just 1.6 percent this year, down from a March forecast of 1.9 percent. The Fed still foresees prices, as measured by a gauge tied to consumer spending, rising 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, achieving its target.

President Donald Trump is expected soon to fill three vacancies on the Fed's influential board, and those new members, depending on who they are, could alter its rate-setting policy.

The betting is that the administration will choose officials who will tilt the Fed toward a more "hawkish" stance. Hawks tend to worry that rates kept too low for too long could escalate inflation or fuel asset bubbles. By contrast, "doves" favor the direction taken under Yellen, favoring relatively low rates to maximize employment.

Yellen, the first woman to lead the Fed, is serving a term that will end in February. So far, Trump has sent conflicting signals about whether he plans to nominate her for a second term.

 SEEconomy   HDWhat Economists Say About the Fed's June Rate Decision; Reactions from economist on the bank's move and its announced strategy   BYBy Kate Davidson    WC532 words   PD14 June 2017   ET23:52   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPThe Federal Reserveraised its benchmark federal funds rate to a range between 1.00% and 1.25% on Wednesday and announced a framework for reducing its $4.5 trillion portfolio of holdings sometime this year.

Officials also released new quarterly economic projections, and Chairwoman Janet Yellenheld a press conference. Here are some reactions from economists:
   TDAlthough we continue to expect another hike this September with balance sheet runoff being announced in December, there are risks to that call. First, the statement acknowledged the weak inflation, but the Committee seems to be looking through it. Ongoing soft inflation could delay another step to normalization. Second, the lean in the paragraph about the balance sheet increases somewhat the likelihood that the Committee runs off its balance sheet in September, rather than December, but for now, we are retaining our call of a December runoff. --Seth Carpenter, Samuel Coffin and Robert Sockin, UBS

Fitch believes the Fed is increasingly comfortable with its normalization process and less data-dependent following recent inflation readings that have been slightly lower than consensus expectations (although they remain close to target). The interest rate hike showed the Fed was prepared to look through weak first quarter consumption and GDP and underlines Fed concerns about unemployment falling too far below its equilibrium rate. --Brian Coulton, Mark Brown, Fitch Ratings

The unemployment rate has dropped by half a point in the past four months, but the Fed now expects, comically, no further decline across the rest of the year. This makes no sense at all and likely will have to be revised in September, by which point it might be just 4.0%, well below the Fed's 4.6% Nairu [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment] estimate, down 0.1pp from March. That's just not consistent with the market's view that the Fed will hike only once more in this cycle. One side has to blink, and given the Fed's 50-year obsession with the unemployment rate, it's unlikely to be Dr. Yellen. --Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics

The FOMC statement was about as expected. The committee raised the fed funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, and announced some information on reducing the size of its balance sheet. The near-term expected path for the fed funds rate looks similar to the previous path. The FOMC, rightfully so, expressed a little more uncertainty that inflation would return to the 2 percent target, but that is still the most likely outcome given an unemployment rate in May of 4.3 percent. --Gus Faucher and Stuart Hoffman, PNC

The Fed seems comfortable with the economic outlook, although recent inflation developments have unnerved it and further unexpected softness could see a modestly more cautious approach to tightening. However, for now the FOMC appears to remain convinced that in the light of a tight labour market the "appropriate management of risks" includes "gradual" withdrawal of policy accommodation. --David Page, AXA IM

 HD*S&P Economists Report On  Federal Reserve  Policy Rate Increase   WC1,644 words   PD14 June 2017   ET23:30   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP14 Jun 2017 17:30 ET  Press Release: S&P Economists Report On Federal Reserve Policy Rate Increase
   TD
 
 
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) June 14, 2017--As broadly anticipated, the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hiked the Federal funds rate by 25 basis 
points (bps) today to the target range of 1.00%-1.25%. The decision was 8 to 
1, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari preferring to leave rates 
unchanged. S&P Global continues to expect one more rate hike of 25 bps in 2017. 
 
The Fed also outlined details on balance sheet normalization, stating it 
intends to start the unwinding process this year if the economy evolves as 
anticipated. The Fed didn't provide an exact start date or the optimal size of 
the balance sheet at the end of the normalization process, but it did provide 
how it would taper reinvestments. 
 
The normalization plan states that the FOMC expects to trim $10 billion per 
month from reinvestment in the first three months ($6 billion for Treasuries 
and $4 billion for agency debt and mortgage-backed securities) and raise the 
amount by $10 billion every three months until it reaches $50 billion per 
month within 12 months ($30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for agency 
debt and mortgage-backed securities). The cap will then remain in place until 
the portfolio shrinks to the size necessary to implement monetary policy 
efficiently and effectively, though the FOMC may settle on a larger portfolio 
than what it held before the financial crisis. In her press conference 
following the meeting, Chairwoman Janet Yellen made the point the Fed could 
implement the balance sheet unwind "fairly soon." 
 
In the policy statement, the Fed said that the economy continues to expand at 
a moderate pace, with household spending and business investment picking up. 
The statement acknowledged job gains have moderated recently, but they have 
been solid nevertheless. The Fed noted the recent decline in inflation but 
said it's expected to stabilize around the 2% objective over the medium term. 
In her remarks, Chairwoman Yellen made a point about inflation that one-off 
reductions in wireless telephone services and prescription drugs are holding 
down broader prices. 
 
The FOMC forecast revisions revealed very little change from those made in 
March. The FOMC members' median GDP growth forecast for this year is 2.2% (was 
2.1% in March) and 2.1% for 2018 (unchanged from March). The committee's 
median forecast for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation was 
revised down to 1.6% for 2017 (was 1.9%) and remained unchanged at 2.0% for 
2018 onwards; the median projection for core PCE (excluding food and energy) 
inflation edged down to 1.7% from 1.9%. Core inflation was 1.5% year on year 
in April. The Fed also revised down its forecast of the year-end unemployment 
rate--to 4.3% in 2017 (was 4.5%) and 4.2% in 2018-2019 (was 4.5% in March 
projections). Its estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment edged 
down to 4.6% (was 4.7% in March). 
 
The overall range of the Fed's so called "dot plot" of interest rate 
projection is still more or less the same as in March with a slight downward 
tweak in the estimate for 2019 (2.9% now versus 3.0% in March). To be sure, 
the Fed's median interest rate projection still anticipates only three rate 
hikes of 25 bps each in 2017 (i.e., one more hike this year) and similarly 
three hikes in 2018. 
 
All indications from the FOMC statement, forecasts, and Chairwoman Yellen's 
press conference are that the FOMC will take a "gradual" approach and will 
remain data-dependent.

 HDFitch: Fed Heading for Faster-than-Expected Normalisation   WC1,697 words   PD14 June 2017   ET21:50   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LP(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, June 14 (Fitch) Today's rate hike and comments by the Federal Reserve reinforces our view that U.S. interest rates will normalise faster than financial markets expect, Fitch Ratings says. The Fed on Wednesday raised the fed funds target rate for the third time in seven months, to 1.00%-1.25%. The Fed also announced that it expects to start phasing out full balance sheet reinvestment in 2017 and provided details on the modalities of doing so. The rate increase and accompanying comments bolster our view that the fed funds rate is likely to normalise at 3.5% by 2020, and U.S. 10-year bond yields will rise back above 4%. These developments would mark a significant shift in the global interest rate environment.
   TD Fitch believes the Fed is increasingly comfortable with its normalisation process and less data-dependent following recent inflation readings that have been slightly lower than consensus expectations (although they remain close to target). The interest rate hike showed the Fed was prepared to look through weak first quarter consumption and GDP and underlines Fed concerns about unemployment falling too far below its equilibrium rate. . Our fed funds rate forecasts also reflect scepticism regarding the idea that the equilibrium (or "natural") U.S. real interest rate has fallen close to zero. We think the fall in actual real rates is explained by the slowdown in potential GDP growth driven by demographics and weaker productivity growth, and by an elongated credit and monetary policy cycle. As this extended credit cycle comes to an end, Fitch believes the Fed will set rates according to its view of the U.S.'s long-term potential growth rate and its inflation target. This suggests the equilibrium nominal fed funds rate would be 3.5%-4% if real rates normalise in line with our estimate of U.S. potential growth at slightly below 2%. The impact on bond yields will also be determined by how far the term premium rises from the current historically low level partly caused by the Fed's Quantitative Easing (QE) programme. The Fed's approach to balance sheet normalisation sees reinvestment only to the extent that maturities exceed pre-set caps. The caps will initially be set at low levels but will rise to maximum levels of USD30bn per month for Treasuries and USD20bn per month for agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.

 HDFed raises rates, unveils balance sheet cuts in sign of confidence   WC782 words   PD14 June 2017   ET22:16   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year, signaling its confidence in a growing U.S. economy and strengthening job market.

In lifting its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent and forecasting one more hike this year, the Fed seemed to largely brush off a recent run of mixed economic data.
   TDThe U.S. central bank's rate-setting committee said the economy had continued to strengthen, job gains remained solid and indicated it viewed a recent softness in inflation as largely transitory.

The Fed also gave a first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

It expects to begin the normalization of its balance sheet this year, gradually ramping up the pace. The plan, which would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities, did not specify the overall size of the reduction.

"What I can tell you is that we anticipate reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis," Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference following the release of the Fed's policy statement.

She added that the balance sheet normalization could be put into effect "relatively soon."

The initial cap for the reduction of the Fed's Treasuries holdings would be set at $6 billion per month, increasing by $6 billion increments every three months over a 12-month period until it reached $30 billion per month.

For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, rising by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reached $20 billion per month.

U.S. stocks edged lower and prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains after the Fed's policy statement. The dollar <.DXY> was largely flat against a basket of currencies after reversing earlier losses, while the price of gold fell.

"The Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open (for) the start of balance sheet runoff, and the fact that they haven't slowed their projected path of rate hikes suggest they can do both balance sheet and rate hikes at the same time," said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities.

EYES ON INFLATION

The Fed has now raised rates four times as part of a normalization of monetary policy that began in December 2015. The central bank had pushed rates to near zero in response to the financial crisis.

Fed policymakers also released their latest set of quarterly economic forecasts, which showed only temporary concern about inflation and continued confidence about economic growth in the coming years.

They forecast U.S. economic growth of 2.2 percent in 2017, an increase from the previous projection in March. Inflation was expected to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast.

A retreat in inflation over the past two months has caused jitters that the shortfall, if sustained, could alter the pace of future rate hikes. But the Fed maintained its forecast for three rate hikes next year.

The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent, from 1.8 percent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank's 2 percent target for more than five years.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Labor Department reported consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, the second drop in three months.

Yellen indicated the Fed still remained confident inflation would rise to its target over the medium term, bolstered by what she described as a robust labor market that is continuing to strengthen.

The Fed's estimates for the unemployment rate by the end of this year moved down to 4.3 percent, the current level, and to 4.2 percent in 2018, indicating the Fed believes the labor market will continue to tighten.

The median estimate of the long-run neutral rate, which is seen as the level of monetary policy that neither boosts nor slows the economy, was unchanged at 3.0 percent.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented in Wednesday's decision.

   LP1501 ET - The dollar is paring deep losses from earlier in the day as Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen sounds an upbeat tone on the economy in a press conference following the Fed's decision to raise rates. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.3% compared to losses of 0.6% earlier in the day. Yellen's statements that the economy appears to have rebounded and the Fed's economic projections released earlier show that officials believe recent weakness in inflation and other data is transitory, Commonwealth Forex's Omer Esiner says. (chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com)
   TD1430 ET - The Treasury curve is flattening more after the Fed which raises short term rates and sticks to its plan of raising rates once more by the end of this year. This galvanizes bond investors and traders to sell short-term debt and buy long term debt, a bet that further tightenings would slow down growth and inflation. The yield spread between the 10-year note and the 2-year note is recently at 80bps, near the 75bps from July 2016 that was the flattest since 2007. (min.zeng@wsj.com)

1409 ET - In the wake of several soft inflation readings, Fed officials lower their median forecast for inflation this year. Officials now see PCE inflation growing 1.6% on the year in 2017, down from a 1.9% forecast in March. They also cut their expectation for 2017 core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, to 1.7% from 1.9% in their last forecast. The Fed targets 2% headline inflation growth, but it has struggled for years to hit that. (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry)

1405 ET - Fed officials lowered their median projection for where they see the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year, to 4.3% from the 4.5% they predicted in March. Private economists had expected the move given the labor market's recent performance. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in May, its lowest level in 16 years and well below the level Fed officials had in March expected to see by the end of the year. Officials cut their forecasts for the years ahead too: to 4.2% from 4.5% for both 2018 and 2019. In the longer run, policy makers see the jobless rate at 4.6%, down slightly from 4.7% in March. (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry)

1403 ET - The Fed says that it plans to start tapering its balance sheet later this year, in a gradual fashion. It plans to slowly and predictable slow the ongoing process of reinvestment, as was widely expected. It will allow Treasurys to shrink faster than mortgage securities. The Fed does not know the level of reserves they'd like to see in the banking system, and it does not know how far it wants to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It also reaffirmed that short-term rate changes are the main way it will affect the economy. There are few surprises in the announcement, but the still unresolved starting date suggests markets will have to mull not just the timing of an increase, but the start of balance sheet draw down as well. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1316 ET - The Fed's "dot plot" and economic forecasts are likely to be affected by unexpected weakness in inflation and surprising unemployment strength. If so, a diminished inflation outlook joined with expectations of even lower joblessness highlights an increasingly discordant case for future rate rises. The exit of Fed governor Daniel Tarullo and Richmond Fed leader Jeffrey Lacker, and the entrance of Raphael Bostic at the Atlanta Fed, could alter the interest rate outlook at the margins. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1259 ET - If the Fed does indeed raise rates and announce its balance sheet plans today, it's pretty much a sure thing Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari will dissent. He's worried inflation is too low and unsure how markets might respond to balance sheet cuts, and that's put him at odds with his colleagues. He already booked a dissent in March. There's an outside chance Chicago Fed leader Charles Evans could find a way to a no vote given recent inflation weakness, but that seems unlikely. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1244 ET - "We now expect the FOMC statement to include a stronger acknowledgement of the recent soft inflation data, and our expectations for the Summary of Economic Projections have become incrementally more dovish," economists at Goldman Sachs say following the soft CPI reading. The bank sticks to its call of another rate hike in December following an increase today. The bank expects the Fed's update dotplot--scheduled at around 2 p.m. along with the Fed statement--to continue to show a median of 3 rate hikes in 2018. That is a small downward revision from the bank's previous expectation of an increase to 3.5 hikes.(min.zeng@wsj.com)

1102 ET The euro rises to a seven-month high against a weaker dollar after U.S. inflation and retail sales data came in below forecasts, ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting later Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates, with focus on how quickly rates may rise further. "For the Fed, today's reports are a twin disappointment but not likely enough to fundamentally change their outlook for continued growth and inflation gradually converging to target over time," says Michael Hanson, strategist at TD Securities. Although unlikely to be a theme this week, continued "softness" in economic data "could call into question the Fed's conviction." EUR/USD rises 0.7% to $1.1297, stopping shy of chart resistance at $1.13 and the November 9 peak $1.1305. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)

0953 ET - Markets remain confident that the Fed will raise interest rates at the close of its meeting today, but weak inflation data released this morning is raising doubts about future tightening. Fed-funds futures now show a 43% chance that the Fed follows a rate-increase today with more tightening this year, CME Group data show. That's down from 52% a day earlier. Renewed doubts about the Fed's rate path are weighing on the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields. WSJ Dollar Index slides 0.6%, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falls to a new 2017 low. (chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com; @chelseydulaney)

0942 ET - With most seeing a Fed interest-rate increase as a foregone conclusion, analysts say their focus will be on something else: whether the central bank acknowledges a recent soft patch in inflation. The consumer price index fell slightly in May, pushing yields on the 10-year US Treasury note lower and marking the second decline for the index in the past three months. Extended weakness could complicate the Fed's plans for future rate increases. Another issue: how the Fed plans to wind down its balance sheet. "The balance sheet runoff discussion continues to be the most risky thing the Fed is engaging in, and they do not want to trigger another taper tantrum," said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

0850 ET - The breakeven of France's July 2027 OATei, a bond indexed to eurozone inflation, is one of the cheapest among eurozone linkers and is also attractive versus inflation swaps, says Aman Bansal, rates strategist at Citi. This linker, along with the July 2047 OATei and the March 2025 OATi--which is indexed to French inflation--will be reopened at an auction on Thursday. Citi holds long positions in the 2027 OATei breakeven versus Germany's April 2026 linker Bund, and also versus the July 2047 OATei, Mr. Bansal says. Citi finds that entry levels still look attractive to buy July 2027 OATei breakevens on cross market basis and on the curve. The French Treasury Agency auctions a total of EUR1 billion to EUR1.5 billion in the three linkers. (emese.bartha@wsj.com ; @EmeseBartha)

   LPU.S. stock indices initially rose, but then gave up those gains after the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point and unveiled plans to begin shrinking its $4.5 billion balance sheet starting this year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell five points, or 0.02% to 21,320, paring back earlier gains that lifted the benchmark more than 40 points. But the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.5%, or 32.5 points.
   TDThe rate hike was as expected, with policy makers voting to raise interest rates to a range of 1% to 1.25%, despite weaker inflation and some signs of economic softening. The central bank still sees the economy reaching its 2% inflation goal.

The Fed still eyes one more rate hike this year, highlighting a rosier job market.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury ticked higher following the announcement, rising to 2.133% from 2.10% earlier today data showed a negative turn for consumer price inflation and retails sales. Bond prices fall as yield rise.

Shares of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT) inched 1.6% higher to $126.32 a share.

Elsewhere in the ETF realm, the Financials Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF) was down 0.4% to $24.38, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLB) has fallen 1.3% to $54.39. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLE) has tumbled 2.1% to $66 a share.

 HDUS Fed raises key  interest rate  to 1.0-1.25%, signals one more hike   BYHeather SCOTT    WC562 words   PD14 June 2017   ET20:35   SNAgence France Presse   SCAFPR   LAEnglish   CYCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2017 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved. 
   LPThe US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 1.0-1.25% on Wednesday and signaled another increase remains likely this year, despite the recent spate of weak economic data.

In explaining the second rate hike of 2017, the Fed noted that "the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year."
   TDBut the US central bank acknowledged that the preferred inflation measure will remain below the two percent target for some time.

The Fed's quarterly projections show they still anticipate making a third rate increase this year, with the median federal funds rate ending 2017 at 1.4 percent.

That would be followed by three rate increases in 2018 and three more in 2019, with the key rate at 2.9 percent by the end of that period.

Analysts in recent weeks have become increasingly doubtful the Fed will indeed go ahead with a third rate increase later this year, as inflation, consumption and other economic data have indicated the weakness seen in the first quarter has continued.

However, the statement from the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated that it still believes "with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."

The decision came just hours after government data was released showing the Consumer Price Index fell further from the two percent target in May, and retail sales declined, pushing Fed futures markets to put the chances for another rate increase this year to below 50 percent.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was holding a press conference to explain the decision further, and observers will look for justification of the Fed's confidence.

One FOMC member, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari, dissented, voting against the rate hike, preferring to keep policy on hold for now.

In their quarterly projections, Fed officials saw the economy growing slightly faster than previously forecast, with GDP up 2.2 percent this year, a tenth of a percentage point higher than in March, but unemployment and inflation now seen lower.

The estimate for the central bank's preferred measure of inflation, the PCE price index, was cut three-tenths to 1.6 percent, while the core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was cut two-tenths to 1.7 percent, according to the Summary of Economic Projections.

In the policy statement, the FOMC said: "Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected remain somewhat below two percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's two percent objective over the medium term."

The Fed now sees the unemployment rate ending the year at 4.3 percent, where it sits currently, rather than the 4.5 percent previously expected.

The central bank also confirmed that it will begin later this year to implement a plan to reduce the size of its investment holdings, which were built up to record levels during the financial crisis to help support the economy, especially once interest rates reached zero.

As long as the economy "evolves broadly as expected," the plan "would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings."

And it predicted U.S. unemployment would end the year at 4.3% instead of its previous 4.5% forecast. The Fed said the U.S. economy is growing "modestly so far this year." The vote to raise rates was 8-1, with Neel Kashkari preferring to leave them unchanged.

   LPThe Federal Reserve is likely to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point after its two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday, the fourth such increase since December 2015. Officials also will release new projections for the economy and interest rates, and could announce their plan for shrinking the Fed's portfolio of Treasury and mortgage bonds. The central bank will release a statement and the forecasts at 2 p.m. EDT, and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen holds her quarterly press conference at 2:30 p.m. Here's what to watch for:

The Upward Path for Interest Rates
   TDAs in previous years, the Fed and markets are at odds over the central bank's projected path of rate increases. Fed officials in March raised their benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 0.75% and 1%, and penciled in two more quarter-point rate rises this year. The new forecasts to be released Wednesday will show whether they are sticking to that story. Investors, though, see a nearly 50% probability that this week's rate increase will be the last one this year, according to fed-funds futures data from CME Group. In the past, the Fed has eventually lowered its expectations to match market estimates.

Balance Sheet in the Balance

Investors will be particularly attuned to any new Fed information on its plans for shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. Officials have laid out a tentative plan to slowly let those securities run off the balance sheet as they mature. It is still unclear how long and gradual the Fed will want this process to be, or when it will begin. Expect to get a few more answers Wednesday, either from the Fed statement or from Ms. Yellen during her press conference.

The New Low on Employment

How low can the unemployment rate go? In March, Fed officials anticipated it would end the year at 4.5%. It already is at 4.3% and still could fall farther. Clearly, officials are going to have to revisit their employment projections for 2017. And they could lower their 4.7% estimate for the longer-term unemployment rate, the level that signals a fully healthy labor market. If they do, it might help explain why inflation pressures have been so muted.

Inflation, the Perpetual Weakling

Inflation hit the Fed's 2% target in February after undershooting it for nearly five years, which appeared to validate officials' economic outlook. Since then, though, the personal-consumption expenditures price index—the Fed's preferred gauge—sunk back to 1.7% in April. Officials say the recent drop is merely a temporary phenomenon. But what if it isn't? Look to the statement and Ms. Yellen's press conference for clues about the Fed's latest thinking on sluggish price gains.

The Chairwoman's Future

Ms. Yellen's term as chairwoman ends next February. But her term on the Fed's board of governors isn't up until 2024. In the past, Fed chairmen have stepped down once their term at the helm is up to avoid upstaging their successors. Ms. Yellen hasn't ruled out staying on if she isn't offered a second term as chairwoman. If she does, it would give President Donald Trump one less seat to fill on the seven-member Fed board. Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out reappointing her, but isn't expected to do so. Ms. Yellen may give insight into her thinking during her press conference.

 HDFed Officials Lower Forecasts for Unemployment -- Market Talk   WC1,448 words   PD14 June 2017   ET20:05   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP1405 ET - Fed officials lowered their median projection for where they see the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year, to 4.3% from the 4.5% they predicted in March. Private economists had expected the move given the labor market's recent performance. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in May, its lowest level in 16 years and well below the level Fed officials had in March expected to see by the end of the year. Officials cut their forecasts for the years ahead too: to 4.2% from 4.5% for both 2018 and 2019. In the longer run, policy makers see the jobless rate at 4.6%, down slightly from 4.7% in March. (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry)
   TD1403 ET - The Fed says that it plans to start tapering its balance sheet later this year, in a gradual fashion. It plans to slowly and predictable slow the ongoing process of reinvestment, as was widely expected. It will allow Treasurys to shrink faster than mortgage securities. The Fed does not know the level of reserves they'd like to see in the banking system, and it does not know how far it wants to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It also reaffirmed that short-term rate changes are the main way it will affect the economy. There are few surprises in the announcement, but the still unresolved starting date suggests markets will have to mull not just the timing of an increase, but the start of balance sheet draw down as well. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1316 ET - The Fed's "dot plot" and economic forecasts are likely to be affected by unexpected weakness in inflation and surprising unemployment strength. If so, a diminished inflation outlook joined with expectations of even lower joblessness highlights an increasingly discordant case for future rate rises. The exit of Fed governor Daniel Tarullo and Richmond Fed leader Jeffrey Lacker, and the entrance of Raphael Bostic at the Atlanta Fed, could alter the interest rate outlook at the margins. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1259 ET - If the Fed does indeed raise rates and announce its balance sheet plans today, it's pretty much a sure thing Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari will dissent. He's worried inflation is too low and unsure how markets might respond to balance sheet cuts, and that's put him at odds with his colleagues. He already booked a dissent in March. There's an outside chance Chicago Fed leader Charles Evans could find a way to a no vote given recent inflation weakness, but that seems unlikely. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1244 ET - "We now expect the FOMC statement to include a stronger acknowledgement of the recent soft inflation data, and our expectations for the Summary of Economic Projections have become incrementally more dovish," economists at Goldman Sachs say following the soft CPI reading. The bank sticks to its call of another rate hike in December following an increase today. The bank expects the Fed's update dotplot--scheduled at around 2 p.m. along with the Fed statement--to continue to show a median of 3 rate hikes in 2018. That is a small downward revision from the bank's previous expectation of an increase to 3.5 hikes.(min.zeng@wsj.com)

1102 ET The euro rises to a seven-month high against a weaker dollar after U.S. inflation and retail sales data came in below forecasts, ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting later Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates, with focus on how quickly rates may rise further. "For the Fed, today's reports are a twin disappointment but not likely enough to fundamentally change their outlook for continued growth and inflation gradually converging to target over time," says Michael Hanson, strategist at TD Securities. Although unlikely to be a theme this week, continued "softness" in economic data "could call into question the Fed's conviction." EUR/USD rises 0.7% to $1.1297, stopping shy of chart resistance at $1.13 and the November 9 peak $1.1305. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)

0953 ET - Markets remain confident that the Fed will raise interest rates at the close of its meeting today, but weak inflation data released this morning is raising doubts about future tightening. Fed-funds futures now show a 43% chance that the Fed follows a rate-increase today with more tightening this year, CME Group data show. That's down from 52% a day earlier. Renewed doubts about the Fed's rate path are weighing on the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields. WSJ Dollar Index slides 0.6%, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falls to a new 2017 low. (chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com; @chelseydulaney)

0942 ET - With most seeing a Fed interest-rate increase as a foregone conclusion, analysts say their focus will be on something else: whether the central bank acknowledges a recent soft patch in inflation. The consumer price index fell slightly in May, pushing yields on the 10-year US Treasury note lower and marking the second decline for the index in the past three months. Extended weakness could complicate the Fed's plans for future rate increases. Another issue: how the Fed plans to wind down its balance sheet. "The balance sheet runoff discussion continues to be the most risky thing the Fed is engaging in, and they do not want to trigger another taper tantrum," said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services.

0850 ET - The breakeven of France's July 2027 OATei, a bond indexed to eurozone inflation, is one of the cheapest among eurozone linkers and is also attractive versus inflation swaps, says Aman Bansal, rates strategist at Citi. This linker, along with the July 2047 OATei and the March 2025 OATi--which is indexed to French inflation--will be reopened at an auction on Thursday. Citi holds long positions in the 2027 OATei breakeven versus Germany's April 2026 linker Bund, and also versus the July 2047 OATei, Mr. Bansal says. Citi finds that entry levels still look attractive to buy July 2027 OATei breakevens on cross market basis and on the curve. The French Treasury Agency auctions a total of EUR1 billion to EUR1.5 billion in the three linkers. (emese.bartha@wsj.com ; @EmeseBartha)

0850 ET - The soft CPI drives investors to dial back inflation bets by selling TIPS and migrating cash into nominal bonds. The allocation contributes to the big slide in 10-year Treasury yield after the data. The 10-year breakeven rate, or the yield premium on the 10-year note relative to the 10-year TIPS, is down 4bps at 173bps, the lowest since November. With inflation expectation moving away from the Fed's 2% target, policy makers may need to be cautious in raising rates. (min.zeng@wsj.com)

0841 ET - Weak retail sales and smaller-than-forecast core CPI spark buying frenzy in Treasurys, sending the 10-year yield to a session low. The yield falls to near 2017 low below 2.16%. The data boosts market expectation that a possible rata hike announced by the Fed later today may be the last one this year given signs of slowing growth momentum and inflation. But some warn the bond market may be underestimating the Fed's desire to normalize interest rates. Fed rate decision is due at 2pm followed by Yellen's briefing. The yield on the 10-year note is 2.157% vs 2.206%. (min.zeng@wsj.com)

0837 ET - The Fed won't get much comfort about the strength of the US economy from today's economic data. Not only did retail sales fall 0.3% in May, but inflation weakened. The Labor Department's consumer price index fell 0.1% in May from a month earlier, the second decline in three months. The annual gain fell to 1.9% in May from 2.2% in April. Lower gasoline costs were a major culprit. Core prices, which exclude food and gas, increased 0.1% last month from April and rose 1.7% over the past year. Weaker overall inflation won't likely dissuade the Fed from raising interest rates after its policy meeting Wednesday. But, combined with new signs of weak consumer spending, the inflation figures could affect the timing of future increases. (joshua.mitchell@wsj.com; @JMitchellWSJ)

0833 ET - US retail sales slipped in May as Americans trimmed spending at auto dealers, gas stations and department stores, another hurdle for the slow-growing economy. Sales at retail stores and restaurants dropped by 0.3% from the prior month, the steepest decline since January 2016. Excluding autos, sales were down 0.3%, excluding gasoline they were down 0.1% and excluding both they were flat. Sales at nonstore retailers, mostly online shopping at places like Amazon.com, posted a healthy 0.8% rise. Elsewhere the picture was fairly bleak, with sales down or flat at restaurants and bars, and electronics, building supply, health, and sporting goods stores. Retail sales capture a slice of consumer spending, a key driver of the economy. (jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.com; @jeffsparshott)

0747 ET - UBS issues downbeat forecasts for South Africa and Russia GDP growth and is also less positive on emerging market EMEA currencies. With Russia recently leaving a prolonged recession, with less growth in early 2017, UBS maintains its GDP forecast at 1.3%. It cuts its GDP forecast for South Africa, which also saw more modest GDP growth early in the year, to 0.7%. These are the only two countries where UBS predicts 2018 GDP growth to exceed 2017 growth. UBS also says although the ZAR, TRY, PLN and RUB started the year strong, it expects the currencies to weaken by year end. UBS predicts most central banks will maintain their current rates through the end of the year, excepting Russia which is expected to cut rates to 8%, and the Czech Republic which is expected to raise rates to 0.25% in the fourth quarter. (sarah.gardner@dowjones.com)

0734 ET - In its latest forecast updates on emerging EMEA, UBS analysts increase 2017 GDP forecasts for the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Turkey. It expects GDP to rise by between 3.8% and 3.9% in Poland, Hungary and Turkey, and by 3.2% in the Czech Republic. "The combination of solid Q1 GDP prints, stronger Eurozone recovery, UBS' downward revision in oil price trajectory and several country specific factors (strong consumer and rising EU fund absorption in CEE, credit and fiscal boost in Turkey)" are primary reasons for the forecast upgrades, UBS says. It adds that growth for these countries is likely to have peaked in the first quarter or first half. (sarah.gardner@dowjones.com)

   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer prices declined in May, reflecting a big drop in energy prices and smaller declines in a number of other areas. It was the second monthly decline in the past three months and underscores how inflation has been a no-show in the slow-growing U.S. economy.

Consumer prices edged down 0.1 percent last month following a small 0.2 percent increase in April, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Prices had fallen 0.3 percent in March. In addition to a drop in energy costs last month, the price of clothing, airline fares and medical care also declined.
   TDCore inflation, which excludes energy and food, rose a slight 0.1 percent in May.

The Federal Reserve was expected to boost a key interest rate later Wednesday. But some economists suggested that the unexpected slowdown in inflation in recent months may cause the Fed to slow the pace of further rate hikes.

"From out of nowhere we have now had three months of unusual weakness in underlying prices," said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics.

He said the inflation slowdown was occurring at the same time that the unemployment rate has fallen to a 16-year low.

"It won't stop the Fed from hiking interest rates later today, but it increases the downside risks to our forecast that there will be a further two rate hikes in the second half of this year," he said in a research note.

Over the past 12 months, consumer prices are up 1.9 percent while core inflation has risen 1.7 percent. The Federal Reserve seeks to manage interest rates to promote moderate annual gains in inflation of 2 percent. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, tied to consumer spending, has been below 2 percent for five years and in recent months slipped back a bit.

However, Fed officials have said they believe the recent slowdown in price gains reflected transitory factors and they expect inflation will resume moving toward 2 percent as low unemployment helps to boost wages. Unemployment in May dipped to 4.3 percent.

In May, food costs edged up a tiny 0.2 percent while energy costs fell 2.7 percent, led by a 6.2 percent drop in the price of gasoline. Over the past 12 months, food costs are up just 0.9 percent while energy prices have risen 5.4 percent.

Clothing costs dropped 0.8 percent in May while the cost of new cars and used cars both fell 0.2 percent.

Medical services such as the cost of doctor's visits dipped 0.1 percent in May but have risen 2.5 percent over the past 12 months.

   LPEuropean stock markets rose Wednesday and the dollar mostly firmed against rivals after drops for Asian equity indices and a record-high close on Wall Street, as traders awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate meeting.

The US central bank is all but certain to raise interest rates, leaving the main focus on chair Janet Yellen's comments.
   TDSome analysts suggest the rise could be the Fed's last this year as traders fret over tepid US inflation and the future of President Donald Trump's big-spending, tax-cutting agenda.

Hopes for those policies had fuelled expectations of a surge in prices -- and a jump in borrowing costs -- but the agenda is now in trouble as the tycoon faces political crises.

"With the rate hike now 96 percent priced in, focus will fall on the Fed's forward guidance and importantly their views surrounding low inflation," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda trading group.

In Europe on Wednesday, a closely-watched survey showed that confidence among German investors fell back in June -- breaking a run of euphoric mood indicators in recent months.

The ZEW institute's poll measuring economic expectations among financial players shed 2.0 points to 18.6 points in June -- well below its long-term average of 23.9.

Despite the June drop, "prospects for the German economy remain favourable, not least thanks to the positive development of economic growth in the European Union in the first quarter of this year", ZEW president Achim Wambach said in a statement.

In Britain meanwhile, official data showed that the unemployment rate remains at 4.6 percent, the lowest level for 42 years. At the same time however, average weekly earnings are falling against a backdrop of rising UK inflation caused in large part by a weak pound lifting import costs.

"There was more bad news for the UK consumer on Wednesday after regular wage growth, excluding bonuses, fell to 1.7 percent, its lowest level since late 2014," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at traders City Index.

"Falling real wage growth is not a new theme, but the fact that inflation-adjusted wage growth has continued to fall to its lowest level for three years, is likely to keep a lid on" a recovery for sterling, which has fallen sharply for much of the time since Britain last year voted to exit the European Union.

Elsewhere Wednesday, oil prices rose before the release of US energy inventory numbers that provide clues regarding crude demand in the world's biggest economy.

Watchdog the International Energy Agency said Wednesday that global oil output will expand faster than worldwide demand next year, primarily as US producers rack up crude production, and that could hamper exporters' efforts to prop up prices.

The IEA's assessment came a day after OPEC complained that increased output in the US was slowing efforts to rebalance supply and demand in the oil market.

 HDGLOBAL MARKETS--Stocks march on as Fed rate hike looms, dollar steady   WC499 words   PD14 June 2017   ET10:56   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPLONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Wednesday, but worries about stretched valuations and caution before a near-certain rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve kept their gains in check, while the dollar steadied against a basket of major currencies.

The widely expected quarter-point interest rate hike will take the Fed funds target rate above 1 percent for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
   TDMarket participants' focus will be on signals on the frequency of further hikes and how the Fed plans to unwind its huge Treasury bond stockpile over the years ahead.

The U.S. central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday with a news conference to follow from Chair Janet Yellen.

"With financial conditions remaining supportive ... and US financials breaking higher, the Fed may see little reason to moderate its rate hike projections when meeting today," strategists at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.

The U.S. bank expects the dollar to gain 2 percent against major currencies over the next few weeks.

On Wednesday, the dollar index barely budged as slightly firmer moves against the euro and yen were offset by losses against the commodity bloc of currencies, such as the Australian and Canadian dollars.

Worries about the pace of global growth and weakness in markets for the commodities they produce drove a 5-percent slide in the values of both Australia's and Canada's dollars between March and May.

Relatively upbeat economic data from China and a surge in expectations of higher Canadian interest rates have helped currencies of commodities-related economies.

Optimism about the global economy also underpinned European equities where the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.6 percent, led by industrials and financials. Stocks on Wall Streets hit a record high overnight.

However, worries about valuations, particularly in the tech sector which nosedived last week, are on the rise.

A record number of investors said equities are overvalued and three-quarters said internet stocks are expensive or in a bubble, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager poll showed on Tuesday

Strategists at Deutsche Bank warned that its European "complacency indicator", which measures valuations relative to market volatility, was at an 11-year high, and the bank expects economic momentum to fade in coming months.

The MSCI All-Country World index was up 0.1 percent and has remained stuck in a tight range this month.

Europe's benchmark bond yield held near seven-week lows ahead of the Fed decision.

In commodities, oil prices fell more than 1 percent, on the backfoot again on worries about US oversupply. Brent crude oil was down 45 cents a barrel at $48.27 while U.S. crude was 50 cents lower at $45.96. (Reporting by Vikram Subhedar; Editing by Andrew Heavens)

 SEMarkets   HDIceland's Central Bank Cuts Rates on Strong Króna; Decision comes despite a strong domestic economy and prospects of considerable fiscal easing   BYBy Nina Adam    WC244 words   PD14 June 2017   ET11:50   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPFRANKFURT—Iceland's central bank on Wednesday cut its key interest rate by another 0.25 percentage points, as a firming national currency continued to weigh on the island's inflation outlook.             
   TDSedlabanki Islands lowered the interest rate on seven-day term deposits to 4.5% from 4.75%. The decision, which marks the second rate cut in about four weeks, comes despite a strong domestic economy and prospects of considerable fiscal easing.             

"A stronger anchor for inflation expectations at target and the appreciation of the króna have enabled the Monetary Policy Committee to achieve its legally mandated price stability objective with a lower interest rate than would otherwise have been possible," the central bank said.             

In a global context, the decision is unusual, because most developed-country central banks are not currently contemplating rate cuts or other forms of additional stimulus.             

On the contrary, the U.S. Federal Reserve has embarked on a series of interest rate rises and others are expected to follow later this year and during 2018—if the global economy continues to grow, as expected.             

Iceland's economy has performed strongly in recent years, led by booming tourism. And the central bank in May raised its economic growth forecast for 2017 to 6.3% from 5.3%, citing better exports and the prospect of more fiscal easing.

 HD3 things to watch for from the  Federal Reserve  on Wednesday   BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER    CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,031 words   PD14 June 2017   ET09:01   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2017.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — There isn't much suspense about what the Fed will announce when its latest policy meeting ends Wednesday: That it's raising its key short-term interest rate for the third time in six months.

The job market — with unemployment at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent — has improved to such an extent that the Fed is thought to feel it's time to modestly raise its benchmark rate again. The move, to a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent, will likely lead to somewhat higher rates on some consumer and business loans. The idea is to ensure that the U.S. economy doesn't overheat.
   TDBut beyond the announcement of another rate hike, anticipation surrounds the possibility that the Fed could signal policy shifts in a statement it will issue, in updated economic forecasts and in a news conference with Chair Janet Yellen. Investors want to know, for example, how fast the pace of rate increases may be in coming months or whether Washington's political paralysis has concerned the Fed.

Here are three things to watch for after the Fed's meeting ends:

___

FUTURE PACE OF RATE HIKES:

After leaving its benchmark rate at a record low near zero for seven years, the Fed has raised rates three times, by a quarter-point each time — once in December 2015, again last December and a third time in March. The Fed has previously forecast that it will raise rates three times in 2017.

Though investors have pegged the likelihood of a rate increase Wednesday at near 100 percent, there's much less certainty about the prospect or timing of any further hikes. Some Fed watchers expect another increase in September. Others say the Fed may want to wait until December. The reasoning is that the policymakers will want more time to determine whether a slowdown in growth and inflation at the start of 2017 was indeed "transitory," as they described it in May, or the start of another slump that could lead the Fed to halt its rate hikes.

Investors will be watching the language in the Fed's policy statement to describe the economy, along with Yellen's comments during her news conference.

One signal could come from the Fed's quarterly "dot plot." This is an illustration representing the anonymous forecasts of each Fed official — the board members as well as the 12 regional bank presidents — for the timing of future rate hikes. It's this chart that provides the current expectation of three rate increases during 2017.

___

BALANCE SHEET REDUCTIONS

Starting in 2008, the Fed expanded its balance sheet five-fold to its current $4.5 trillion through purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities. The Fed began the purchases after it had cut its main policy lever, the federal funds rate, to a record low near zero. The bond purchases were intended to depress long-term borrowing rates as an additional way to energize the economy as it struggled to emerge from the Great Recession.

The Fed is no longer buying new bonds. But it's been replacing maturing bonds to prevent its portfolio from shrinking. Speculation has grown that Yellen may reveal details at her news conference of a plan to gradually reduce the portfolio.

One possibility suggested would have the Fed begin to pare its holdings late this year and then gradually shed incrementally larger amounts into next year, while allowing the financial markets to adjust to the impact.

Investors are keenly interested in whatever the Fed says about its balance sheet because gradual reductions in its portfolio could raise long-term rates, even if only slightly. The Fed will likely want to unveil its plan well in advance of actually trimming its portfolio to avoid spooking the markets.

___

WASHINGTON'S POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION

During his campaign, President Donald Trump pledged to pursue a program of deep tax cuts, less regulation, more infrastructure spending and tougher enforcement of trade rules. He billed his plan as a way to accelerate economic growth from the sluggish 2.1 percent annual rate of the past eight years. Trump said his program would double growth to 4 percent or better, though the administration based its first budget plan on achieving a lower but still highly ambitious goal of 3 percent annual growth.

The problem is that Trump's economic agenda remains stalled, in part because of resistance in Congress, in part because of a lack of details so far from the administration. Concern has also arisen that Congress could delay action on raising the federal debt limit and approving a new budget — possibilities that could upset markets.

Given such risks, analysts will be watching to see whether the Fed offers a more pessimistic outlook for the economy in the updated projections it will issue Wednesday. In its previous forecast in March, the Fed had predicted growth for this year and next year at 2.1 percent, unchanged from the lackluster pace of recent years

Investors will also be listening for any signals Yellen sends about her own future. After Trump's surprise election victory, Yellen had announced that she planned to serve out her term, which ends in February. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he would nominate Yellen for a second term.

In the meantime, Trump has three vacancies to fill on the central bank's seven-member board, an opportunity for him to begin influencing Fed policy. The administration has yet to nominate any candidates for Senate confirmation.
