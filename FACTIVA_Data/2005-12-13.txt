   LPThe dollar weakened on Monday ahead of Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting, with investors expecting that it may say interest rates are no longer stimulating the US economy.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its key rate for a 13th straight time to 4.25 per cent but markets were speculating that the central bank will tweak its language and provide clues on the pace of future rate hikes.
   TDThe greenback dropped nearly one per cent against the euro and was $1.1885 against the euro at 11.45 GMT. It also hit a 14-year low of C$1.1523 against the Canadian dollar. It was down 0.4 per cent at C$1.1525.

The dollar also eased against the yen to Y120.50 from Y120.69, erasing an earlier gain. Against sterling it fell to $1.7640 from $1.75.

The yen was weighed by expectations for more selling by Japanese investors and mutual funds, while individual investors were putting winter bonuses to work in high yielders such as the Australian dollar.

The euro reached a record Y143.40 against the yen, while sterling hit a seven-year high around Y212.85 and the Australian dollar edged back towards last week's 8l-year high at Y90.42.

Sterling gains came ahead of a series of UK economic figures which were expected to show few prospects for growth or inflation that would bolster a case for interest rate rises.

The New Zealand dollar gained more than one per cent peaking at $0.7093, rebounding from a sharp fall last week. However, later the currency eased to $0.7074 against the dollar.

 CLMTuesday's Markets   HDGreenspan's Parting Shot? --- DJIA Jumps 55.95 Points as Fed Raises Rates But Hints at an End; Next Meeting Is His Last   BYBy E.S. Browning    WC834 words   PD14 December 2005   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPINVESTORS APPLAUDED the Federal Reserve's latest announcement on interest rates, but by day's end, the applause began to fade.

Stocks initially surged after the Fed raised its target short-term interest rate and dropped a strong hint that it is nearing the end of its 17-month campaign of rate increases.
   TDBut as the day wore on, some analysts warned that the Fed probably still has two or more rate increases to come next year. And some money managers took advantage of rising stock prices during the day to sell and lock in results before the year ends, which also helped push stocks back down.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up as much as 103.74 after the Fed news, finished with a gain of 55.95 points, or 0.52%, at 10823.72. The Dow again is moving within sight of the 11000 mark, but it is up just 0.4% this year, and remains more than 100 points off the 4 1/2-year high of 10940.55 hit in March.

The Nasdaq Composite Index and Standard &Poor's 500-stock index both neared their own recent 4 1/2-year highs, although the late-day selling left them just short of those marks. Trading was heavy.

Even many bullish investors said they expect one or two more Fed rate increases, and that helped keep a lid on the optimism.

"I do think the Fed has told us: Not many more," said Alfred Kugel, chief investment strategist at Chicago investment-management firm Atlantic Trust/Stein Roe. He expects the Fed to boost its target rate twice more next year. The Fed pushed the target, which influences the rate for overnight bank lending, to 4.25% yesterday, and Mr. Kugel said he thought it could go as high as 4.75% next year.

The prospect of an end to rate increases is good news for the economy, and "that means that we could have a continuation of the year-end rally. Not a big one, but some," Mr. Kugel said.

As usual, banks including J.P. Morgan Chase, Wachovia and Wells Fargo immediately raised the prime rate, the base rate for many consumer and business loans, by a quarter point, to 7.25%. The higher prime rate is an almost automatic response to a Fed move. It is one way that the Fed rate increases translate into real-world slowing of the economy, by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow.

Treasury bond prices rose amid expectations that the Fed's target interest rate won't go up much further.

The dollar, which had fallen in anticipation of a Fed signal that its rate increases were coming to an end, recovered somewhat as analysts concluded that there could be further increases next year. The talk of an end to Fed rate increases was bad news for gold, which investors sometimes buy when they are worried about coming trouble. Gold gave back some of its recent gains. Oil was little changed.

The Fed's statement after its interest-rate meeting yesterday caught investors' eyes because it didn't include a reference to rates being "accommodative," which appeared in earlier statements. That was taken as a signal that the Fed thinks rates now are in the "neutral" area, meaning that, unless the Fed suddenly sees a problem such as inflation looming, rates are about where they can stay.

The Fed also stopped talking about raising rates at a "measured" pace, sparking speculation that it might now raise rates intermittently, instead of bumping them up a quarter-point at each meeting. Some investors began to speculate that the Fed might take a pause in its rate increases at its Jan. 31 or March 28 meeting.

The January meeting will be Alan Greenspan's last as Fed chairman, while the March meeting would be Ben Bernanke's first in that role. The Fed doesn't hold a February interest-rate meeting.

But the Fed also inserted a comment that "further measured policy firming" -- meaning more rate increases -- "is likely to be needed," and that was what helped stifle the optimism at day's end.

The S&P 500 rose 0.56% yesterday, or 7.00 points, to 1267.43, up 4.6% this year. The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.18%, or 4.05 points, to 2265.00, up 4.1% for 2005.

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks and bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, or $2.81 for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield down to 4.523%.

The dollar strengthened, to 120.12 yen, up from 119.72, while the euro fell against the dollar to $1.1929 from $1.1952.

 CLMMonday's Markets   HDHigh Hopes for Fed Moves Fail to Lift Stocks   BYBy E.S. Browning    WC462 words   PD13 December 2005   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPINVESTORS HAVE turned optimistic about what the Federal Reserve will say after today's meeting on interest rates, but you wouldn't know it from the stock market's performance.

Hopes that the Fed -- after its expected 13th interest-rate increase in this cycle -- will signal a coming end to rate increases were stifled by fears about rising oil prices, and stocks went nowhere. Gold futures, however, continued to soar, jumping $1.40 to $528.40 an ounce, another 24-year high. The metal is benefiting from worries about inflation, the dollar and international political tensions.
   TDThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10.81 points, or 0.1%, to 10767.77, down 0.1% since the year began. The broader Standard &Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.08%, or 1.06 points, to 1260.43, up 4% for 2005.

Investors widely expect the Fed to modify the statement it issues after its meeting, to suggest that it is getting near the end of interest-rate increases. But that didn't put to rest concerns that the Fed still could raise rates at two or more additional meetings, including today's, before it stops. So when oil prices pushed back above $60 a barrel -- rising $1.91 to $61.30 -- stock indexes turned listless.

"We may be closer to the end than the beginning of the rate increases, but there are probably another couple to come," said stock trader Michael Driscoll at New York brokerage firm Bear Stearns. "The Santa Claus rally is probably going to be in a little bit of jeopardy unless we get some backup in energy prices."

The Dow industrials also suffered from news that a judge declared a mistrial in a lawsuit over Dow-component Merck's painkiller Vioxx.

The dollar took its hardest fall in four months against the yen, amid fears that an end to U.S. interest-rate increases will soften demand for dollars.

The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.19%, or 4.22 points, to 2260.95, up 3.9% this year.

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks were mixed. On the Big Board, where 1.41 billion shares traded, 1,779 stocks rose and 1,565 fell.

Bond prices declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, or $1.88 for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield up to 4.557%. The 30-year bond was down 7/32 to yield 4.749%.

The dollar weakened. Late in New York, it traded at 119.72 yen, down from 120.64, while the euro rose against the dollar to $1.1952 from $1.1817.

 CLMCredit Markets   HDTreasurys Prices Rise Modestly After Fed Rate, Policy Decision   BYBy Michael Mackenzie Dow Jones Newswires    WC794 words   PD14 December 2005   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC3   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPThe prices of Treasury securities strengthened modestly after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised interest rates and altered its policy statement.

In a fully expected move, the FOMC raised its federal funds target to 4.25% from 4%, the 13th such increase since June 2004 when the overnight borrowing rate was 1%. In its accompanying statement, the FOMC dropped the phrase that policy remains "accommodative."
   TD"They are signaling they are not too far from finishing their tightening by dropping accommodative," said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.

That was enough to push Treasury prices a little higher, yet the move lacked conviction, as the Fed at the same time affirmed it will continue tightening policy because of concerns about inflation.

The market reaction was "more noise than anything else," said Anton Pil, global head of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York, adding that investors are back to watching economic data for clues as to future policy moves.

The FOMC said "some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance."

At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 9/32 point, or $2.8125 per $1,000 face value, at 99 26/32. Its yield fell to 4.523% from 4.557% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was up 13/32 point at 109 17/32 to yield 4.723%, while the two-year note, the most sensitive to monetary policy changes, barely budged, adding 2/32 to 99 22/32 to yield 4.413%.

Interest-rate futures continued to price in a further quarter-point rate increase at the January meeting of the FOMC, with opinion split as to whether the funds rate will reach 4.75% in March.

Commercial banks raised their prime rate to 7.25%, further squeezing borrowers whose interest-rate payments are tied to the prime rate -- for instance, payments on certain types of home-equity loans.

Mr. Pil said the FOMC is likely to raise rates to 4.75% by March and then pause at that level, when Ben Bernanke will have taken the reins from retiring Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.

The spread between two-year and 10-year note yields was steady at 0.11 percentage point.

Further rate increases should compress this relationship close to zero and possibly invert the yield curve, if the 10-year yield falls below that of the two-year note, Mr. Konstam of CSFB said.

"The curve typically inverts right at the end of the tightening cycle," he added.

However, a key ingredient for pushing the yield curve into inversion would be a slower economic growth next year -- a pace below 2.5% compared with this year's 3.5% pace -- as the Fed continues to tighten policy, Mr. Pil said.

Emerging Markets

Brazil said it will pay off loans from the International Monetary Fund two years ahead of schedule, making for the biggest single repayment to the IMF.

The government said it will make a $15.46 billion early payment, directly from Brazilian foreign reserves, eliminating Brazil's debt with the multilateral lender by the end of the month. The move, the government said, reflects the strength of Latin America's biggest economy.

According to Finance Minister Antonio Palocci, owing to the early payments, Brazil will save some $900 million in interest expense in 2006 and 2007. Mr. Palocci said Brazil expects to continue "close and friendly" relations with the IMF.

Risk premiums on Brazil dollar-denominated debt tightened on the news, narrowing 0.10 percentage point to 3.07 percentage points over comparable U.S. Treasurys on the J.P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index Plus.

Igor Arsenin, sovereign strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, said the repayment generally shows "the decreased vulnerability of Brazil to the external environment."

   LPThe US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled the final stage in its rate tightening campaign, as it stopped describing monetary policy as accommodative but highlighted inflation risks.

The Federal Open Market Committee raised the Federal funds rate another quarter point, its 13th consecutive move, bringing the target rate to 4.25 per cent. But it deleted the language - used repeatedly since June of last year, when the Fed funds rate was at 1 per cent - that "policy accommodation" would continue to be removed at a rate "that was likely to be measured".
   TDThe statement made explicit the Fed's intention of slowing growth in the economy to contain inflation pressures. But it gave a looser formulation on the future of interest rate increases, suggesting uncertainty among policymakers about how much further rates would rise, suggesting the central bank was close to the end of the tightening cycle. "The committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance," it says. "The committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives."

The new formulation suggested the committee would raise rates again in January, at the last meeting chaired by Alan Greenspan, and probably after that - but also handed a cleaner slate to his successor, Ben Bernanke, who will take over in February and chair his firstmeeting in March. The Federal Reserve said economic expansion remained solid in spite of high energy prices and disruptions related to the Gulf coast hurricanes.

--Does Not Update Current Economic Forecast
--Notes Future Federal Reserve Chair is Inflation Targeting Proponent

By Courtney Tower

     OTTAWA (MNI) - Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge said Monday that 
central banks from rich and poor countries alike are turning to formal 
inflation targeting as their key instrument of monetary policy. 

     Dodge made a spirited argument for a policy focused on keeping 
inflation within defined targets, in a speech in the western Canadian 
city of Regina, just as the United States moves at the Federal Reserve 
from a chairman who opposes the practice to a proponent. 

     Debate in the United States on the issue is likely to increase as 
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has spoken often against inflation 
targeting, is to be succeeded by Ben Bernanke, described by Dodge as "an 
enthusiastic proponent." 

     Dodge devoted his entire speech before the Regina, Saskatchewan, 
Chamber of Commerce to inflation targeting, steering clear of economic 
forecasts or other issues that might roil the political climate during 
Canada's current national election campaign. 

     The Bank of Canada adopted explicit inflation targets -- using 
monetary policy, interest rate increases or decreases, to keep national 
inflation within a 1%-3% range, in 1991. Canada was the second country 
to do so, after New Zealand. Now, Dodge said, about 20 central banks 
have done so, ranging from those of the United Kingdom and Sweden to 
those of Chile and Brazil. 

     "In every case, inflation targeting has been a success," he said. 
"Inflation rates have been reduced, and central banks have generally 
been able to hit their targets. Inflation has become less persistent 
where inflation targeting is practised, and it is reasonable to assume 
that well-anchored inflation expectations are a good part of the reason 
why." 

     Dodge added: "Given this success, it seems likely that other 
countries will join the ranks of inflation targeters in coming years." 
Turkey had announced last week its intention to start the practice next 
year. Inflation targeting was being discussed in the United States, 
where Bernanke "has been an enthusiastic proponent." 

     Inflation targeting works because it creates price stability and 
reduces inflation expectations, Dodge said. It keeps a central bank 
accountable -- if inflation persistently is off-target, "we are 
committed to explaining the reasons why, what we will do to return it to 
target, and how long we expect the process to take." 

     Any central bank with an independent monetary policy, and which 
targets inflation, "must allow its currency to float," Dodge said. It 
could not control inflation at home and the external values of its 
currency at the same time. If the target was inflation, the currency had 
to float -- something which Dodge has long argued is key to a country 
smoothing out the ups and downs of international economic shifts. 

     Dodge argued that inflation targeting does not limit a central bank 
from acting or applying judgment during extraordinary events. He noted 
that Canada had lowered interest rates "quickly and decisively" after 
the 9/11 terrorist attacks in case there should be a major loss of 
confidence. There wasn't such a loss and the bank reversed itself 
quickly, he said. 

     Canada currently is looking at whether the 2% mid-range target, 
which he calls the actual target, is the best one, and that whether the 
bank should be making its decisions with the idea of their taking effect 
within an 18-24 month time-frame. But overall, he said, "inflation 
targeting is the best anchor (to inflation and inflation expectations) 
we've seen."

 HDU.S. mortgage bonds tighten after Fed hikes rates     BYBy Julie Haviv     WC635 words   PD13 December 2005   ET23:03   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited  
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage-backed securities tightened versus comparable Treasuries on Tuesday after U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers raised short-term interest rates as expected but dropped the reference to "accommodation" in its statement.  

"Lower MBS coupons strongly outperformed higher issues because the Fed essentially indicated that it is nearing the end of interest rate hikes and that translates into less extension risk," a mortgage trader said. "Buying from hedge funds and money managers helped us tighten on the day as originators and servicers stayed sidelined."  
   TDFederal Open Market Committee, the policy making arm of the Federal Reserve, raised the target federal funds rate for the 13th consecutive time to 4.25 percent from 4.00 percent.  

Active 15- and 30-year mortgage-backed securities were 3/32 lower to 12/32 higher. Bond equivalent yields on 30-year 5.50 percent coupon MBS ranged from 5.556 percent to 5.785 percent, 0.046 percentage point to 0.070 percentage point less than late Monday.  

Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> rose 7/32 to 99-25/32 to yield 4.525 percent on Tuesday. Yields, which move inversely to price, were down from Friday's 4.559 percent.  

Market participants are also mulling the implications of the Fed's move on the U.S. housing market.  

The Fed's interest rate increases seem to be impacting home refinancing activity but not purchase activity, according to Diane Saatchi, senior vice president with the Corcoran Group, a major residential real estate firm.  

"People still seem to believe that home ownership is a sound, important and affordable investment," she said. "I do not foresee the increases at these levels to be any threat to real estate sales while the rates for 30 year fixed are below 8 percent."  

Interest rates remain low from a historical perspective and for some home buyers, the current mortgage rates are still favorable, she said.  

MBS should see increasingly data dependent trading in 2006, similar to that observed in 2004, given the backdrop of market uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. This raises the risk of spreads widening, the company said.  

Weak technical factors are being exacerbated by a higher-than-expected $27 billion in conventional 30-year net issuance for November in MBS, prompting CSFB to maintain its short-term underweight recommendation on MBS.

 SEFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION   HDEnd to rate rise cycle signalled *Fed committee in quarter-point increase *Policy no longer 'accommodative' *Options freed up for Greenspan successor.   BYBy ANDREW BALLS    WC533 words   PD14 December 2005   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   EDUSA Ed2   PGPage 1   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPThe Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a final phase in its monetary tightening campaign, as it stopped describing policy as stimulating the economy.

The Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 4.25 per cent, the 13th consecutive increase since June of last year. But the committee removed from its statement the language used on each previous occasion which had said that "policy accommodation" would continue to be removed at a "measured" pace.
   TDThe new statement suggested that the committee would continue tightening policy, even though the federal funds rate may no longer be accommodative - a reference to the notion of a neutral rate at which policy neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has suggested the notion of interest rate neutrality is too vague and too difficult to measure to provide a precise guide for policymakers.

The Fed's looser formulation on the future path of rate increases suggested uncertainty among policymakers about how much further rates will have to rise and hinted that the central bank is close to the end of its tightening cycle.

The statement said: "The committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives."

The new forward-looking language suggested interest rates will rise again in January, at the last meeting chaired by Mr Greenspan - and probably after that - but handed a cleaner slate to Ben Bernanke, who will take over in February and chair his first FOMC meeting in March.

Futures markets continued to price in another rate increase in January, bringing the Federal funds rate to 4.5 per cent, and a still good but slightly reduced chance of another rise after that to 4.75 per cent.

Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, said: "It is a gradual step towards a little more flexibility. Inflation, the economy and the markets will dictate how much further they go. They say the economy is strong and that inflation risks are tilted a little to the upside. There is nothing yet in the data that will stop the Fed."

The Fed said economic expansion remained solid in spite of high energy prices and disruptions related to the Gulf coast hurricanes - a more confident note than in November - following a string of encouraging data releases.

It said inflation had stayed relatively low and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.

But it warned: "Possible increases in resource utilisation as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures."

The minutes of the Fed's last meeting and public comments from policymakers have indicated a concern about characterising monetary policy as accommodative now that is no longer obviously the case.

Estimates of the neutral rate tend to be centred at about 4.25 per cent.

 HDFed rate increases seen drawing to a close     BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER     CRAP Economics Writer   WC704 words   PD13 December 2005   ET06:26   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - After 18 months in which the Federal Reserve has been pushing interest rates higher to keep inflation under control, the central bank appears to be getting close to the end of its rate increase campaign.  

But there is a divergence of opinion among economists on just when the rate increases will cease. One group thinks the Fed will stop after two more rate increases, while analysts who are more worried about inflation think the central bank could raise rates perhaps four more times.  
   TDThere is no dispute, however, over what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues will do at Tuesday's meeting. Expections are universal that the Fed will increase the funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, by a quarter point to 4.25 percent, the highest level since May 2001.  

It would mark the 13th time the Fed has raised interest rates since it began tightening credit in June 2004 when the funds rate stood at a 46-year low of 1 percent.  

"Another quarter-point rate hike is baked in the cake," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors, a Colorado-based consulting firm. "But we are near the end."  

Jones is in the camp that believes the Fed will boost the funds rate at Tuesday's meeting and then deliver one more quarter-point increase at Greenspan's final meeting on Jan. 31, leaving the funds rate at 4.5 percent.  

But other economists argue that inflation pressures spawned by a surge in energy costs this year will prompt the central bank to keep pushing rates higher even after Greenspan leaves office.  

They also believe that Ben Bernanke, who has been nominated by President George W. Bush to succeed Greenspan, will want to quickly demonstrate his own inflation-fighting credentials.  

For that reason, they are looking for Bernanke to keep pushing rates higher in small quarter-point increments at his first Fed meeting as chairman on March 28 and possibly a final move at the May 10 meeting.  

That would leave the funds rate at 5 percent, a level that some economists believe the central bank may feel is needed to make sure that interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing slow enough to keep inflation under control.  

"The Fed is looking at an economy right now that is growing strongly with upside risks to inflation," said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed board member and currently senior economic adviser at Schwab Washington Research Group, a financial advisory firm.  

Indeed, a variety of recent statistics have come in stronger-than-expected, depicting an economy that is rebounding after the blows delivered by a string of devastating hurricanes and a spike in energy prices.  

Hints about the Fed's future intentions may come from the wording of Tuesday's statement explaining its latest action.  

For all of the rate increases so far, that statement has promised that future increases will occur at a "pace that is likely to be measured," a phrase seen as a signal of more quarter-point increases to come.  

The statement has also described current policy as still accommodative, meaning that interest rates are still low enough to spur economic growth. The Fed's goal has been to raise rates to a neutral level which is not spurring growth or holding it back.  

The minutes of the Fed's last meeting on Nov. 1 showed that policymakers were discussing how the language should be changed, but some economists think that debate may go on a little longer before a consensus is reached.  

"I think they are struggling with how to let markets know the rate hikes are coming to an end," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York. "The problem is that anything they say will get over-interpreted by financial markets."  

For that reason, some analysts think they may leave the wording unchanged at Tuesday's meeting and only change it when they actually have reached the end of the current rate increases sometime next year.

 HDU.S. mortgage bonds widen on supply ahead of Fed     BYBy Julie Haviv     WC466 words   PD12 December 2005   ET16:55   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited  
   LP(Updates prices, market activity)  

NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Yield spreads on U.S. mortgage-backed securities widened against comparable Treasuries for a second consecutive session on Monday as originator supply weighed on the market ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.  
   TD"Trading was very illiquid, so even the moderate supply we saw from originators was enough to cheapen the market," said Arthur Frank, director of MBS research at Nomura Securities International. "(Tuesday's) FOMC clearly kept a lot of investors sidelined."  

Most of the originator selling was in 30-year 5.00 percent coupons, he said.  

The FOMC, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, will meet on Tuesday to discuss U.S. monetary policy. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points for the 13th straight time at the conclusion of its meeting, bringing the federal funds rate to 4.25 percent.  

Participants will be paying particularly close attention to the Fed's accompanying statement for the future pace of rate hikes.  

Active 15- and 30-year mortgage-backed securities were unchanged to 5/32 lower. Bond equivalent yields on 30-year 5.50 percent coupon MBS ranged from 5.626 percent to 5.831 percent, 0.012 percentage point to 0.018 percentage point more than late Friday.  

Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> fell 6/32 to 99-17/32 to yield 4.559 percent on Monday. Yields, which move inversely to price, were up from Friday's 4.529 percent.  

The Fed meeting will probably have a significant impact on MBS, further strengthening JP Morgan's conviction to take down its tactical overweight recommendation for the sector.  

Despite Friday's sell-off in MBS, the risks are not balanced ahead of Tuesday's meeting, according to David Montano, head of MBS strategy at JP Morgan in New York.  

Montano said purchase activity last week suggests a plethora of investors expecting a less hawkish tone from the Fed. The basis, therefore, can come under severe pressure in the event that these investors are disappointed but with only limited tightening upside otherwise, he said in recent research.  

Spreads on mortgage bonds have tightened significantly in the last two weeks, leaving Bear Stearns neutral-to-negative on the sector.  

The company said the current environment paints an unfavorable picture for mortgage bonds.  

GSEs are probably out of the picture given valuations between MBS and agency debt. Plus, the yield advantage of passthroughs is negative after hedging out interest rate risks, the company said in recent research.  

With fixed-rate supply growing, spreads should widen a bit, the company said.

 HDPOLL-Most on Wall St see Fed raising rates beyond January     BYBy Victoria Thieberger     WC590 words   PD13 December 2005   ET23:20   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited  
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve rewrote its usual policy statement after raising interest rates on Tuesday, but it left no doubt on Wall Street that at least one more rate hike is in store, a Reuters poll of economists found.  

The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent, as expected, and the Reuters survey found the majority of economists see more than one rate rise ahead in the New Year.  
   TDWhat changed with the statement, analysts said, was the phase of the tightening campaign.  

For the past 12 interest rate hikes spread over 18 months, the Fed wanted to restore policy to a more neutral level that did not boost economic growth. Further moves will be more dependent on economic data as it rolls in.  

"They are no longer being driven by the desire to get to neutral. They are being driven by inflation concerns ... and that means they're going to 5.0 percent," said Bruce Kasman, senior economist at JP Morgan.  

By eliminating a reference to policy accommodation, the Fed signaled policy was now in a "neutral" range. But that did not suggest they were finished with the tightening cycle.  

The Reuters poll of the top economists on Wall Street found all 21 surveyed expect another quarter-point rate increase in January, to 4.5 percent.  

By the end of the year, the federal funds rate was seen pushing above 4.5 percent by the majority, or 14 of the 20 economists who answered the question. That included 10 economists who saw rates at 5.0 percent or higher.  

"Rather than being on automatic pilot in raising rates toward neutral, the Fed now sees itself in the second stage of the rate hike cycle -- further moves will be perceived by Fed officials as taking policy toward a restrictive stance," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich.  

HEIGHTENED CONCERNS  

Inflation concerns dominated the shorter-than-usual statement from the Fed's policy committee, and added that "some further" policy firming lays ahead.  

"In my mind, 'some' equals more than one," said Drew Matus, senior financial markets economist at Lehman Brothers, noting the statement did not sound dovish to him.  

"Although it creates more flexibility, it does suggest a higher level of concern regarding inflation pressure," Matus said.  

Policy-makers added another layer of concern to their worries about inflation. For the first time, they added capacity constraints in the economy to their list of inflationary pressures.  

That reference could imply that, with the unemployment rate hovering around 5.0 percent, the Fed is starting to worry that tight labor markets may lead to wage pressures, though there has been scant evidence of this so far.  

Financial markets were less sure than the economists about the chances for further rate hikes beyond January, with futures contracts trimming the chances of a follow-up move in March to 60 percent, down from 66 percent before the meeting.  

The March meeting will be the first for new Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and economists are divided over whether he will want to mark his new tenure with a rate rise.

 HDUPDATE 1-US Treasury yields to rise, inflation a concern-BMA     BYBy Andrea Hopkins     WC628 words   PD12 December 2005   ET18:00   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited  
   LP(Adds detail on Fed projections)  

WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury bond yields will continue climbing next year amid inflation worries and three more interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, a survey by the Bond Market Association showed on Monday.  
   TDIn its semi-annual economic survey, the group said gross domestic product would grow 3.6 percent in 2006, roughly the same pace as this year, as capital spending remains robust and consumer spending is kept afloat by job growth and wage gains.  

The threat of higher inflation remained a prominent, if not dominant, concern in markets, however.  

The Consumer Price Index was expected to increase 2.9 percent next year, down from a 3.4 percent rise in 2005, while less-volatile core inflation that strips out food and energy was forecast at 2.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent next.  

"Rising labor costs, a potential ability to pass along price increases, and capacity bottlenecks could contribute to a higher rise in the CPI, although relatively low inflation expectations and confidence in Fed policy will help anchor wage and price setting patterns," the group said.  

The group's median forecast has the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising at a steady pace to 4.73 percent at the end of March, 4.90 percent at the end of June, and 4.93 percent by the close of 2006.  

Panelists were unanimous in expecting another quarter-point interest rate hike from the Fed on Tuesday, and most said they expect policy-makers to change the language they use to explain the increase -- although just how they will change it is open to debate.  

"The majority believe we will see an end to the use of the forward-looking language that describes policy as accommodative, but that the message pretty much will stay the same," said Robert DiClemente, chairman of the association's advisory committee and head of U.S. economic and market analysis at Citigroup.  

A rate hike on Tuesday will be the 13th straight increase by the Fed and will take the federal funds target to 4.25 percent. The BMA predicted rates will reach 4.75 percent by June and stay at that level through year-end -- though some predicted one fewer rate hike than that and some predicted at least one more.  

Energy prices were cited as the dominant risk to the outlook for both economic growth and inflation, as continued declines in oil prices would spur growth but rising prices could slow both business and consumer spending.  

"Other risks include sharp declines in housing prices and the resulting effect on consumer spending, accelerated inflation, and economic weakness outside the United States," said Michael Decker, senior vice president and head of policy and research at BMA.  

Business capital investment was projected to rise 8.9 percent in 2005 and 8.6 percent in 2006.  

Consumer spending was forecast to increase 3.5 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, as motivation for spending shifts to employment and income gains rather than low interest rates and rising home values.  

Slightly over half of the panelists said they expected a change in the Fed's communication style under new Chairman Ben Bernanke. A slight majority expect the Fed to set explicit inflation targets. While most panelists were not in favor of such targets, 39 percent said the move would increase the Fed's transparency.  

"Most panelists, however, did not believe a shift to an explicit target would have a material effect on policy," the group said.

 HDU.S.  Federal Reserve  Chairman Greenspan says world living standards rising     BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA     CRAP Economics Writer   WC373 words   PD14 December 2005   ET23:28   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The spread of free markets is driving the world's living standards higher, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday.  

"Despite worrisome pockets of violence and destruction, commerce and wealth-building continues apace," he said in remarks prepared for delivery at New York University. Greenspan was accepting an honorary degree from his alma mater.  
   TD"On average, world standards of living are rising in large part because of the widening embrace of competitive free markets, especially by populous and growing China and India," he said.  

A copy of his remarks was distributed in Washington.  

Since the autumn of 2001, global gross domestic product per capita has grown more than 8 percent, Greenspan said. Growth in developing Asia, where many of the world's poor reside, has been considerably faster, he added.  

Open and competitive markets have made the global economy more flexible and better able to withstand jolts from terrorism and other problems, Greenspan said.  

Personal trust, he said, is a key to the smooth functioning of markets.  

The wave of corporate accounting scandals that rocked Wall Street in 2001 dented that crucial trust, Greenspan suggested.  

"Corporate scandals in the United States and elsewhere have clearly shown that the plethora of laws of the past century have not eliminated the less-savory side of human behavior," he said. "We should not be surprised, then, to see a reemergence in recent years of the value placed by markets on trust and personal reputation in business practice."  

Greenspan, 79, will retire from the Fed on Jan. 31 after 18-plus years at the helm.  

Fed policymakers on Tuesday boosted a key short-term interest rate to its highest level in 4 1/2 years to keep inflation under control.  

Greenspan had received degrees in economics, including his Ph.D, from New York University.  

British Treasury chief Gordon Brown, who also received an honorary doctorate from New York University on Wednesday, praised Greenspan as "the rock of stability upon which this global economy has been built." Brown also urged the world community to spread the free enterprise system.

 HDFed Boosts  Interest Rate  to 4.25 Percent     BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA     CRAP Economics Writer   WC819 words   PD13 December 2005   ET23:22   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates to the highest level in 4 1/2 years Tuesday but also indicated its 18-month rate-raising campaign was winding down. At least one more increase in borrowing costs seemed in store to keep inflation under control.  

Chairman Alan Greenspan and his Fed colleagues voted unanimously to boost the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans, by one-quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent.  
   TDIt was the 13th consecutive increase of that size since June 2004. That's when the Fed policy-makers embarked on a credit tightening campaign to lift the funds rate -- which had been sliced to a 46-year low of 1 percent when the economy was faltering -- to more normal levels.  

Fed policy-makers had mostly positive things to say Tuesday about the economy, especially its ability to grow solidly despite the Gulf Coast hurricanes.  

In response to the rate increase, commercial banks began increasing their prime lending rate -- for certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans -- to 7.25 percent, also the highest in 4 1/2 years.  

For investors and economists, the Fed's words spoke louder than its rate action, which was expected.  

The Fed policymakers, in a statement issued after their closed-door meeting, eliminated a description they had used each time they raised rates over the past year and a half -- that even with the increases rates were still quite low.  

Economists viewed that deletion as a sign from the Fed that its rate-raising campaign was drawing to a close.  

On Wall Street, stocks got a lift from that, with the Dow Jones Industrials closing up 55.95 points.  

Still, the Fed signaled there is more work to be done before it declares that the economy and inflation are on an even keel.  

The statement said, "Some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance."  

Importantly, the Fed opted to keep the word "measured" to describe future rate increases. Economists have taken that to mean quarter-point rate hikes.  

"The underlying message here is that the Fed is rounding for third and heading for home plate. But they are not finished playing yet," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group.  

Most economists expect another quarter-point increase at the Fed's next meeting Jan. 31. That will mark the last meeting for Greenspan, who will retire after 18-plus year at the helm.  

Many economists also expect another quarter-point increase to follow on March 28, which would be Ben Bernanke's first meeting as Fed chief. That would leave the funds rate at 4.75 percent, where the Fed would move to the sidelines.  

Others, however, predict another increase will come at the May 10 meeting, leaving the funds rate at 5 percent. A few believe the Fed won't stop until the funds rate is boosted to 5.50 percent in August.  

The ultimate course of interest rates will be shaped by what economic barometers going forward say about the economy's standing and the nation's inflation climate.  

For now, the economic picture looks pretty good, Fed policymakers said.  

"Despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appears solid," they said. And "core" inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, "has stayed relatively low," they observed.  

Yet there are inflation risks, they said.  

In another important change to the policy statement, Fed members cited "possible increases in resource utilization" which economists said was code for a strengthening job market as having "the potential to add to inflation pressures." Policymakers also dropped a reference contained in many past Fed statements about healthy productivity gains. Productivity gains help to blunt inflation.  

Altogether, those changes "indicate a higher level of concern with respect to future inflation," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.  

Economists said that was another signal a few more rate increases probably will be in the offing. But Zandi said, "They are close to the end of nearly two years of rising interest rates."  

The Fed's action comes against a recent string of largely good economic news.  

The economy grew at an energetic 4.3 percent pace in the third quarter despite the ill effects of the hurricanes. Economists expect solid growth in the current October-to-December period. A 0.3 percent increase in sales at the nation's retailers in November, released Tuesday, suggested shoppers are spending modestly.  

Employment, meanwhile, rebounded in November after a two-month lull, with payrolls expanding by 215,000.

 HDU.S. mortgage bonds end tighter with swaps     BYBy Nancy Leinfuss     WC467 words   PD14 December 2005   ET23:34   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited  
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage-backed securities tightened versus comparable Treasuries on Wednesday in sympathy with narrower swap spreads before giving up some relative gains, traders said.  

"Mortgages are off their tights of the day, perhaps a tick tighter," said Alec Crawford, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, saying some profit-taking kicked in.  
   TD"We have seen selling from fast money accounts, banks and money managers in 5 and 5.5 percent coupons but not in the 6s. Originators have sold over $1 billion across coupons, in fives through sixes," said Crawford.  

Active 15- and 30-year mortgage-backed securities ended one basis point tighter despite the bout of selling, traders said.  

Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> gained 18/32 to 100-11/32 to yield 4.454 percent on Wednesday.  

On Tuesday, mortgage spreads began to narrow after several consecutive widening sessions on expectations the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its tightening cycle.  

A record trade deficit reinforced expectations of a near-term end to the Fed's interest rate hiking campaign.  

The U.S. trade deficit widened unexpectedly in October to an all-time high of $68.9 billion despite a drop in the cost of imported oil.  

Market players are now looking ahead to the next batch of economic data -- on consumer prices -- due on Thursday.  

Meanwhile, mortgage market participants said a fall below the 4.40 percent level in the 10-year Treasury note yield will likely spur servicers to buy more duration and reverse some of the recent selling in 30-year 5 percent conventional coupons.  

"We remain neutral on the mortgage basis, but biased to sell at current valuations. We continue to dislike low coupons, such as 30-year 4.5 percent coupons. This trade has started to work despite the rally. There is plenty of room left in this trade," said RBS Greenwich Capital in a report.

   LPNEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Treasury debt prices were firmer on Tuesday, supported by a smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. retail sales during November.    

But the market's rise was moderated by a looming interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, expected around 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT). A 13th straight 1/4 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate is widely expected after the central bank meeting.    
   TDRetail sales climbed 0.3 percent when economists had been looking for a 0.5 percent gain. October's results were revised up to a 0.3 percent gains from a previously reported a 0.1 percent dip.    

Sales excluding autos slipped 0.3 percent, also a disappointment considering analysts had been looking for a 0.1 percent increase.    

Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> were up 5/32 for a yield of 4.53 percent, compared with 4.55 percent on Monday.

 HDINSTANT VIEW 4-Stocks-Fed raises rates for 13th time      WC644 words   PD13 December 2005   ET20:21   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds comments)   

NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The following are comments from equity strategists about the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the 13th straight time on Tuesday.   
   TDThe central bank, which raised borrowing costs by a quarter-percentage point to 4.25 percent, also signaled that, while it is not done raising rates, its 1-1/2 year rate-rise campaign has entered a final stage.   

Stocks rose after the announcement.   

PAUL CHERNEY, CHERNEY MARKET ANALYSIS, WEST CHESTER, PA:   

"They changed their language, but they didn't offer any tangible hint that the end of the tightening is close at hand. I don't think the markets can have a big reaction in either direction. The Fed hasn't materially changed what the markets already know, and what the markets already know doesn't hurt them."   

MICHAEL METZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMER HOLDINGS:   

"The Fed is not through with raising interest rates even though they changed their language a bit. I particularly don't read much into the 'accommodation' debate, and everybody in the market expects at least one more rate hike even after today's announcement. It doesn't hurt stocks, but I doubt it is going to be extremely supportive."   

SCOTT FULLMAN, CHIEF STRATEGIST, INVESTEC (US) INC.:   

"This is 'Steady as she goes' for U.S. equities. This keeps in line the measured increases in interest rates that we have seen and come to expect over the past year and one half. The Fed continues to watch economic growth versus the costs of attaining that growth which is anticipated in the marketplace in our opinion. We continue to believe that the stock market will show appreciation as the economy improves going into 2006. The major hinging point remains energy prices which can have a dramatic effect on consumer, corporate and government spending patterns."   

AL GOLDMAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, A.G. EDWARDS:   

"We got about half a loaf. The Fed is indicating that they are close to ending the rate hike cycle and they did drop the reference to the fact that the fed funds were still accommodative, but they kept the 'measured move' reference, which is kind of like getting half a loaf.   

"A full loaf would have been no reference to accommodative stance and no comment about them still needing the measured move, and then I think people would have said the next time they raise interest rates it would have been the last time, and that's January. The market got about what it was looking for and that's why we are up. But remember this is the 11th day of a correction consolidation which should frankly be about over."   

NED RILEY, CEO, RILEY ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON:   

"The rate increase was the expected part. As for the language, some questions have been answered-they kept the word 'measured' in the statement, but they dropped "accommodative," which would imply that we are closer to the end game of Fed tightening than many had anticipated.   

"But the Fed hedged (itself) by mentioning capacity utilization and energy prices that may create inflation pressures down the road. I would expect the markets to accept this as positive, but nothing outlandish, because the Fed has created the usual ambiguity to keep the debate rolling until (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan steps down in January.   

"Overall, I think it's bullish for the stock market, which we should see in financial and tech stocks doing well because of their interest rate sensitivity and high beta, respectively. It's bullish for the bond market, too."   

JAMES OBERWEIS, PRESIDENT OBERWEIS ASSET MANAGEMENT:   

"It sounds like the Fed is trying to give itself maximum flexibility for future meetings."

   LP NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised its target for the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25 percent, as expected.  

 In its statement the Fed said "some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance".  
   TD Story: [nTRT000079]  Text: [nN13352187] COMMENTARY  

 BOB WALTERS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, QUICKEN LOANS, LIVONIA, MICHIGAN:  

 "We got what we expected on the move itself. What is interesting is that the Fed left in the 'measured' language although they changed the phrasing a little bit, observing that they have some increases to go. But they did take out accommodative. By taking that out it appears that they are entering into that zone where monetary policy is neutral, neither stimulative nor restrictive.  

 "But by leaving in measured, we can discern that they are entering the bottom part of that neutral range. They're not signalling that rate rises are over yet, but they are getting nearer. They are signalling that there are one or two more interest-rate hikes. They're signalling that they are beginning to get into that neutral zone. The removal of accommodative basically is signalling the beginning of the end of rate hikes and that heartens the folks who trade bonds for a living.  

 ROBERT SINCHE, HEAD OF GLOBAL CURRENCY STRATEGY, BANK OF AMERICA, NEW YORK:  

 "The Fed felt like it was appropriate to remove the word accommodative because at this point they are trying to signal policy is neutral. Does it mean that policy won't have to change from a neutral range? They did indicate that growth and inflation risks were roughly in balance, which is signaling that there is not a bias as to where they go in the future."  

 TIM MAZANEC, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, INVESTORS BANK & TRUST, BOSTON:  

 "The dollar initially weakened. They did take out the word accommodation but said further measured policy firming is likely. When everybody has had time to read the statement they will realize that there is at least another rate hike and likely more to come, so we are not done yet."

 HDINSTANT VIEW-5: Forex/bonds reaction to Fed statement     WC924 words   PD13 December 2005   ET20:22   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited  
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised its target for the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25 percent, as expected.  

In its statement the Fed said "some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance".  
   TDStory: [nTRT000079] Text: [nN13352187] COMMENTARY  

CHRIS LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK:  

"It was tougher than what was expected by the markets. The Fed is no longer calling policy 'accommodative,' at least not directly, but they talk about further 'measured' policy firming is likely to be needed."  

"The market right now is expecting two more rate hikes, first to 4.50 percent and then 4.75 percent, the first move in January, the second by June and this language is fully consistent with those expectations."  

"The bottom line -- the thinking was that they were going to drop "accommodative" and what they clearly decided to do was spread it out over two meetings to not send the 'wrong' signal that they're done."  

"I think there is still a strong emphasis on the risk of inflation and I think that's where they wanted to steer the conversation. In other words, what they're seeing on the growth side is just fine and inflation is still contained but they emphasize that there are pressures that could lead to inflation.  

BRIAN DOLAN, DIRECTOR OF FX RESEARCH, GAIN CAPITAL, NEW JERSEY:  


  "I think their observations that inflation remains
contained...suggests that it is not that much of a concern for
  

the Fed at this point. Their comment that 'some measured policy firming is likely' suggests that there is going to be a much more wait-and-see attitude depending on how the U.S. data come in. They used that 'measured pace' language to indicate that they may or may not go (hike rates) next meeting. The next rate hike is likely to te the last. This is certainly having a negative impact on the dollar."  

KURT KARL, U.S. CHIEF ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK:  

"It's slightly different language. It's different language saying the same thing. I don't see anything substantively different. They are getting close to the end of raising rates, but they are taking their time.  

They are not going to stop now. They are concerned about inflation even though it looks okay now. It's almost certain that there'll be another rate hike in January.  

I think there'd be three more moves. Bernanke can't just say, 'It's over now.' when he takes over."  

ELISABETH DENISON, ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT WASSERSTEIN, NEW YORK:  

"They managed to drop accommodative, without dropping the measured pace, which sets the tone for January but leaves it open for further out.  

"This statement seems to set the stage for another change in January, and will leave policy more open for when Bernanke takes over. We think they will still tighten in March because inflation risks are still to the upside.  

"The statement is also shorter, they had many too sentences to watch."  

BOB WALTERS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, QUICKEN LOANS, LIVONIA, MICHIGAN:  

"We got what we expected on the move itself. What is interesting is that the Fed left in the 'measured' language although they changed the phrasing a little bit, observing that they have some increases to go. But they did take out accommodative. By taking that out it appears that they are entering into that zone where monetary policy is neutral, neither stimulative nor restrictive.  

"But by leaving in measured, we can discern that they are entering the bottom part of that neutral range. They're not signalling that rate rises are over yet, but they are getting nearer. They are signalling that there are one or two more interest-rate hikes. They're signalling that they are beginning to get into that neutral zone. The removal of accommodative basically is signalling the beginning of the end of rate hikes and that heartens the folks who trade bonds for a living.  

ROBERT SINCHE, HEAD OF GLOBAL CURRENCY STRATEGY, BANK OF AMERICA, NEW YORK:  

"The Fed felt like it was appropriate to remove the word accommodative because at this point they are trying to signal policy is neutral. Does it mean that policy won't have to change from a neutral range? They did indicate that growth and inflation risks were roughly in balance, which is signaling that there is not a bias as to where they go in the future."  

TIM MAZANEC, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, INVESTORS BANK & TRUST, BOSTON:  

"The dollar initially weakened. They did take out the word accommodation but said further measured policy firming is likely. When everybody has had time to read the statement they will realize that there is at least another rate hike and likely more to come, so we are not done yet."

 HDGreenspan says world living standards rising     BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA     CRAP Economics Writer   WC315 words   PD14 December 2005   ET23:25   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The spread of free markets is driving the world's living standards higher, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday.  

"Despite worrisome pockets of violence and destruction, commerce and wealth-building continues apace," he said in remarks prepared for delivery at New York University. Greenspan was accepting an honorary degree from his alma mater.  
   TD"On average, world standards of living are rising in large part because of the widening embrace of competitive free markets, especially by populous and growing China and India," he said.  

A copy of his remarks was distributed in Washington.  

Since the autumn of 2001, global gross domestic product per capita has grown more than 8 percent, Greenspan said. Growth in developing Asia, where many of the world's poor reside, has been considerably faster, he added.  

Open and competitive markets have made the global economy more flexible and better able to withstand jolts from terrorism and other problems, Greenspan said.  

Personal trust, he said, is a key to the smooth functioning of markets.  

The wave of corporate accounting scandals that rocked Wall Street in 2001 dented that crucial trust, Greenspan suggested.  

"Corporate scandals in the United States and elsewhere have clearly shown that the plethora of laws of the past century have not eliminated the less-savory side of human behavior," he said. "We should not be surprised, then, to see a reemergence in recent years of the value placed by markets on trust and personal reputation in business practice."  

Greenspan, 79, will retire from the Fed on Jan. 31 after 18-plus years at the helm.  

Fed policymakers on Tuesday boosted a key short-term interest rate to its highest level in 4 1/2 years to keep inflation under control.  

Greenspan had received degrees in economics, including his Ph.D, from New York University.
