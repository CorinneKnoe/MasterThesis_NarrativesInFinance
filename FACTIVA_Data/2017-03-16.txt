   LPTreasury yields stage modest rebound while Bank of England decision to hold rates comes with a hawkish twist

The dollar continued to retreat in the wake of the Federal Reserve's "dovish" rate rise, while US stocks struggled to maintain their upward momentum and Treasury yields staged a modest rebound.
   TDSterling outperformed most of its major rivals after the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged, as expected, but delivered a hawkish twist in the minutes of its policy meeting.

Meanwhile, relief at the poor performance of Geert Wilders' Eurosceptic Freedom party in the Dutch election offered some support to the euro. Early gains for Dutch and French sovereign bonds reversed by the close, however.

It was the US Fed that continued to dominate the markets agenda after it delivered a widely expected 25 basis point rate rise but stayed cautious regarding the pace of future tightening.

The central bank stuck to its original forecast of three rate increases this year and three in 2018, disappointing some in the markets who had anticipated a more aggressive path.

"Markets took [governor Janet] Yellen as dovish - or perhaps more accurately, less hawkish than expected," said Elsa Lignos, global head of forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets. "Markets are now discounting 1.5 more hikes for this year and a further two next year, well below the five more hikes by end-2018 signalled by the Fed."

Albert Edwards, the famously bearish global strategist at Société Générale, said: "The Fed's lack of verbal assertiveness means the market still cannot bring itself to believe the Fed's own projections for interest rate hikes."

Meanwhile, Hans Redeker, global head of forex strategy at Morgan Stanley, highlighted that, relative to the improvement in financial conditions since November, the Fed had done very little. "Even after this 25bp Fed rate hike, financial conditions are more accommodative by an equivalent of about a 60bp rate cut when compared to December."

The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a weighted basket of peers, was down a further 0.4 per cent at 100.38, leaving it 1.3 per cent down from where it ended on Tuesday.

The euro was flat at $1.0731. "A key plank in our euro depreciation view to parity looks less powerful after the disappointing result for the Freedom party in the Netherlands general election," said Derek Halpenny, analyst at MUFG.

"The Freedom party gained seats but not to the extent polls were suggesting and will ease fears of opinion polls underestimating the true support for Marine Le Pen ahead of the French elections in April and May."

Sterling stood out as it climbed 0.6 per cent to a two-week high against the dollar of $1.2364. The pound was also up 0.6 per cent versus the euro at €1.1514.

The BoE's decision to leave its policy stance unchanged was not unanimous, the minutes of yesterday's meeting showed, with Kristin Forbes - an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee who is due to leave at the end of June - voting for a 25bp rate rise.

Divyang Shah, global strategist at IFR Markets, said: "An out of consensus vote for a hike from an outgoing MPC member has little relevance to the overall outlook for BoE policy.

"However, what was important in the post-meeting statement today was the subtle shift in communication contained within the post-meeting statement. There is now a greater emphasis on what happens to demand and a focus on 'some modest withdrawal of monetary stimulus over the course of the forecast period'."

The yield on the 10-year UK gilt - which moves inversely to its price - rose as high as 1.29 per cent before easing back to end at 1.25 per cent, up 4bp on the day.

Eurozone government bond prices ended lower across the board. The yield on Dutch 10-year debt rose 4bp to 0.54 per cent and its French equivalent added 5bp to 1.09 per cent. The 10-year German Bund yield rose 4bp to 0.45 per cent.

Across the Atlantic, Treasury yields inched higher after the steep falls seen after the Fed's rate announcement. The 10-year yield was up 2bp at 2.53 per cent, but some way short of Tuesday's two-and-a-half-year peak of 2.63 per cent, while the two-year US yield was fractionally higher at 1.32 per cent.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 equity index slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,380 by midday, after rising 0.8 per cent in the previous session. By contrast, the pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.7 per cent.

US energy stocks retreated as oil prices retreated, with Brent down 0.4 per cent at $51.62 a barrel.

But metals prices rose as the dollar dipped, with gold up $8 at $1,226 an ounce and copper rising 0.7 per cent in London to $5,908 a tonne.

 SEMarkets   HDRising U.S. Rates Could Mean Hard Fall for Some Currencies; Change could trigger a reversal of capital flows, potentially destabilizing currencies in places with higher rates   BYBy Saumya Vaishampayan    WC593 words   PD17 March 2017   ET07:58   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPFederal Reserve officials this week signaled that the end is near for a long-distance relationship that has lasted 16 years.

The link in question is the difference between Australian and U.S. interest rates, which has been positive since 2001. As the Fed raised short-term rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday, it projected two more such increases in 2017: If it carries through, the upper end of the target range for U.S. rates will be 1.5% by the year's end—where Australia's benchmark rate is now.
   TDThe closing U.S.-Australian rate gap is a standout example of a trend currently looming over foreign-exchange markets: the narrowing difference between U.S. and global interest rates. While the Fed is now in tightening mode, many central banks that have long had higher benchmark rates—such as those in Australia, India and Brazil—are on hold or cutting.

Currency players often seek to profit from interest-rate gaps, known as the "carry," by investing in stocks, bonds and currencies in countries with higher rates. Now, rising U.S. rates could trigger a reversal of such capital flows, which could prove destabilizing for countries that had benefited from the search for yield during the years when U.S. rates have been ultralow.

The Australian dollar, for example, could tumble by around 15% from its current level against the greenback if the country's central bank keeps rates on hold, according to London-based Capital Economics. It expects the Reserve Bank of Australia to stand pat until 2019 at the earliest.

Moves in the euro in 2014 show how changing interest-rate differentials can result in bad blood for currencies.

The European Central Bankpushed its key \b interest rate\b0  negative in June 2014, while the Fed's target range for its benchmark rate stayed between 0% and 0.25%. The gap between the two regions' rates has since widened, as the U.S. has started tightening. The euro dropped 12% against the dollar in 2014, 10% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"We saw the damage that it can do," said Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Bank Limited, pointing to the euro's exchange rate. "It provides one more reason for someone to sell and one fewer reason for someone to own," he added.

Some investors are sanguine about the impact of narrowing interest-rate gaps, arguing that other factors can influence currencies. A rebound in commodity prices and solid economic data in China, a major trading partner, have brightened Australia's outlook, helping propel the Aussie to a gain of 6.5% this year against the U.S. dollar.

And even as the Fed pushes ahead with rate increases, the currencies of some countries could remain attractive as their interest rates remain much higher, investors and strategists say.

They recommend owning high-yield darlings like the Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee, where benchmark rates are 4.75% and 6.25%, respectively, providing a substantial buffer against rising U.S. rates.

   LPMetals prices rose Friday as hints of a slower pace of U.S. interest-rate increases continued to weigh on the U.S. dollar.

Gold for April delivery settled up 0.3% at $1,230.20 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing at a two-week high. Copper for May delivery rose 0.5% to $2.6915 a pound, also at its highest level in two weeks.
   TDThe WSJ Dollar Index was 0.2% lower, making dollar-priced assets cheaper for holders of other currencies, having fallen more than 1% since the U.S. Federal Reserve lifted interest rates on Wednesday. The commentary accompanying the rate rise was less assertive about the prospect for more increases this year than dollar bulls had expected.

"It's a dollar story based on the commentary around Fed action," said Nitesh Shah, commodities strategist at ETF Securities. "It was less hawkish than people expected."

Looking ahead, he said the dollar will likely continue to dominate commodities markets next week, which brings speeches from Fed officials including Chairwoman Janet Yellen, as well as data that will shed light on the strength of the world's largest economy, including durable goods orders and a purchasing managers index.

Copper prices should also benefit from supply disruptions at mines in Chile and Peru, analysts said. About 8% to 10% of global copper supply has been shut down or disrupted in the past six weeks, according to Barclays.

"We think that the copper market is on the precipice of severe market tightness resulting from supply outages, but it is not there yet," said Dane Davis, analyst at Barclays, in a Friday note.

 HDGap Between Fed-Funds, Overnight Treasury Repo Rates Holds   WC560 words   PD17 March 2017   ET19:10   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPA key overnight borrowing rate used across Wall Street still lags behind the policy benchmark the Federal Reserve voted to lift Wednesday by a quarter percentage point, highlighting changing forces at work in short-term interest-rate markets.

On Thursday, when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised the policy benchmark into a new range between 0.75% and 1%, rates on overnight Treasury repurchase agreements—or “repos,” short-term loans made in exchange for government debt—landed at 0.75%, 0.16 point below the effective federal-funds rate of 0.91%.
   TDThat relationship is consistent with the gap of 0.15 point between the two rates since the start of the year, according to a Bank of New York Mellon index. It was anticipated because market forces, including an overhaul of U.S. money-market fund rules, have driven up demand for government debt and compressed the rates borrowers pay for lending out Treasurys to get cash.

Analysts have attributed the divergence to investors chasing short-term Treasury bills in particular, amid a scarcity of supply from the U.S. government. Treasury has had fewer bills in circulation than normal because of a long-running standoff in Congress over limits on federal borrowing. The supply of bills outstanding had fallen by $148 billion from the end of November to mid-March, according to Wrightson ICAP.

An agreement between lawmakers struck in late 2015 to suspend the borrowing limit expired Wednesday, putting the debt ceiling back in effect. But the Treasury can still use extraordinary accounting measures, leading many analysts to anticipate an increase in bill supply in the next month that should move Treasury repo rates higher again and narrow the gap between repos and fed funds.

Another reason the Treasury repo rate has been driven lower is healthy demand for a Fed repo program, which is an alternative investment channel for government money-market funds that can’t find bills to buy with their cash. In the Fed program, the central bank lends out Treasurys from its $4.5 trillion balance sheet as collateral in exchange for sucking up excess cash from money-market funds, so as to keep short-term rates in its desired range.

The BNY index factors in those Treasury-backed repo transactions with the Fed, which as of Thursday paid participants a rate of 0.75%, unlike other indexes that don’t include the trades. The Fed’s repo rate is designed to set a floor under the central bank’s range while another tool sets the ceiling, leaving the federal-funds rate to float in between.

A fed-funds rate of 0.91% is still seen as accommodative by Fed officials. The Fed has signaled that rate increases should continue gradually, not as aggressively as some in the market anticipated. Before this week, the Fed had raised rates only twice, in December 2015 and December 2016, since 2006.

“Rates are just getting closer to neutral, which is appropriate and arguably should have been done last year,” said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, which oversees about $165 billion and is owned by Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.

 SEEconomy   HDYou're More Likely to Want to Fight Inflation if You Remember It, Study Finds; NBER paper examines how Fed officials' personal experiences with inflation can influence their  interest-rate  stances   BYBy David Harrison    WC702 words   PD17 March 2017   ET18:02   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWhether you're a "hawk" or a "dove" has a lot to do with your personal experience with inflation, according to a new working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Federal Reserve officials who have experienced high inflation are more likely to expect higher inflation in the future and to call for raising interest rates to combat it even if it means dissenting at policy meetings, according to the paper by Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California Berkeley and Stefan Nagel and Zhen Yan, both of the University of Michigan.
   TDOn the other hand, those who came of age in low-inflation eras are more likely to favor cheaper borrowing costs.

Fed officials frequently say they are "data-dependent," forming their views based on incoming statistics. But it turns out those views also may be colored by their pasts. Previous studies have looked at how people rely on personal experience when making decisions. This research suggests economists are no different, said Ms. Malmendier.

"There's always been a certain reluctance to think that even experts might be subject to biases, and part of my mission as a researcher has been to prove that wrong," she said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

Recent comments from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggest she is aware how memory can affect policy makers.

"My parents have lived through the Great Depression, and their discussion of that experience was part of what was my childhood growing up, and so I knew that it was possible that there would be economic events that could cause massive disruption to an economy and great harm to many individuals and households," she said during an appearance in Chicago this month.

The researchers gathered biographical information of all Fed officials from 1951 to 2014 and used that to construct an estimate of each official's personal inflation experience. Looking at the 659 Fed meetings that took place during those years, they find officials cast a total of 7,350 votes, of which 160 were dovish dissents and 265 hawkish dissents.

Hawkish dissenters, or those favoring higher interest rates, tended to have experienced higher levels of inflation during their lifetimes than their colleagues, they write. The study suggests personal experience was a driving factor in the dissents even after taking into account other factors that could explain the diverging views.

The late Henry Wallich, a former Fed governor, was an extreme case. Having grown up in Germany during the hyperinflation of the 1920s, Mr. Wallich showed an uncommon commitment to battling inflation, which led him to dissent 27 times, the paper said.

The researchers also find that personal experience with price increases left "a significant imprint" on officials' speeches and economic forecasts.

They look at forecasts for each central banker between 1992 and 2004 from the twice-yearly monetary policy report released with a 10-year lag. By matching an official's forecast with that official's personal experience and by assessing how the official's estimate deviates from the Fed staff's, they found that policy makers weigh their personal experience when thinking about inflation's future path.

The paper could offer a hint about the tenor of monetary policy in the decades to come. As the generation of policy makers who saw the inflation spikes of the 1970s retire, they could be replaced by younger colleagues whose experience of inflation comes from the so-called "Great Moderation" era of the 1990s. Looking further ahead, we could see a new generation of dovish policy makers, or those favoring lower interest rates, who came of age in the past decade and see a greater threat of inflation growing too slowly rather than too fast.

"As that turnover continues to go in the direction of people who have not had such a vivid experience of inflation in the 1980s, we would expect the direction to be towards more dovish decision-making," Ms. Malmendier said.

   LPCentral banks around the world are signaling a move away from ultra-easy money, but financial markets are responding as if the low-interest-rate party isn’t stopping.

A day after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point, the People’s Bank of China raised a suite of key short-term interest rates and the Bank of England signaled that an increase in rates may not be far off. Turkey also raised a lending rate, while central banks in Japan, Norway and Indonesia held rates steady.
   TDThe events marked a striking turn from the low-interest-rate policies many central banks ushered in as recently as last year to spur markets and slow-growing economies. Low rates make it cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow, spend and invest and tend to push up the value of asset prices like stocks.

Markets sometimes shudder at the prospect of higher borrowing costs, but that isn’t happening now. U.K. stocks ended at a record Thursday, and European and Asian indexes rallied.

Following Wednesday’s Fed meeting, U.S. stocks climbed, benchmark bond yields sank and the dollar slid. Global stock markets as a whole have rallied over the past half year. The Dow Jones Global Index, which tracks 47 developed and emerging countries, has gained 9.7% since mid-September, while the Dow Jones Global ex-U.S. index is up 7.9%.

The market reaction can be seen as a sign of growing confidence that global growth is picking up, lessening the need for central banks to prop up spending and investing with low rates. Booming markets, if they continue, could even encourage central bankers to speed the pace of monetary tightening.

The Bank of England held its benchmark interest rate steady at 0.25% Thursday, saying uncertainty surrounding Britain’s economic prospects as it prepares for exit talks with the European Union justified keeping policy on hold, even as a falling pound fuels faster inflation.

Minutes of deliberations revealed signs of growing unease about the BOE’s easy-money stance. One rate-setter on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voted for an immediate increase in the BOE’s benchmark rate to 0.5%, while other members indicated that they might not be far behind.

The BOE cut its main policy rate to a new low of 0.25% and revived a crisis-era bond-buying program two months after voters chose to leave the EU in a referendum in June. But the British economy showed resilience, and officials in recent months have grown concerned about quickening inflation.

“This is clear evidence the BOE is changing its tune, moving gradually toward an overdue tightening cycle,” said Kallum Pickering, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank in London.

China raised several short-term interest rates for the second time this year, just hours after the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary tightening.

The unprecedented, nearly simultaneous rate increase showed Beijing’s desire to prevent capital from flowing outside the country toward places like the U.S. Higher rates are meant to tempt investors to keep deposits parked in domestic banks. Beijing is also trying to cool booming domestic markets.

Minutes before Chinese markets opened, the People’s Bank of China announced it had raised the interest rates it charges commercial banks in the money market on seven-day, 14-day and 28-day loans each by 0.1 percentage point. These rates are also known as reverse repurchase agreements, or repos.

The central bank pushed the benchmark seven-day repo rate, for instance, to 2.45% from 2.35%. The PBOC also raised the interest rate it charges on special loans, known as a medium-term lending facility, to 22 financial institutions.

The PBOC said the rate increases reflected “strengthening market expectations” for higher funding costs in light of a recovering Chinese economy and the Federal Reserve’s recent rate increases.

“Besides the tough task of cutting leverage in the economy, the PBOC’s decision also reflects a hope to keep the interest-rate gap between China and the U.S. at an appropriate level, so as to avoid pressure on the yuan and capital flows,” said Liu Dongliang, a senior economist at China Merchants Bank.

Investors liken cheap money to a punchbowl at a cocktail party: Guests help themselves to as little or as much as they like, until someone takes the punchbowl away and ends the party.

The Fed started draining its punchbowl in December 2015 by raising its benchmark federal-funds off zero for the first time in seven years. It raised rates by a quarter-percentage point again in 2016 and a third time this week.

Interest rates remain low by historical standards, but this week’s rate increase moved the U.S. central bank into a new, more aggressive phase of withdrawing easy money from the financial system as the economy improves.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last week left the central bank’s policies in place and indicated that the ECB probably won’t need to enact fresh stimulus to support the economy, citing diminished urgency to fight deflation.

Developments in the U.S. show how exuberant markets are in some cases offsetting central banks’ shift away from easy money.

Even though the Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point Wednesday, U.S. financial conditions eased by the equivalent of a quarter-percentage-point rate cut, according to a Goldman Sachs index that measures the cumulative effect of stock, bond and currency movements on overall financial conditions. An easing of financial conditions means funds are more accessible to households, businesses and investors for borrowing, spending and investing.

Analysts attributed the U.S. market reaction to the fact that the Fed stuck with its projection for nudging rates higher two more times in 2017. In December, the Fed said it expected to nudge rates higher three times in 2017, likely in quarter-percentage-point increments. It stuck with that expectation after Wednesday’s meeting. The Fed still sees inflation rising gradually back toward its 2% target, a sign of the economy’s return to normalcy.

“Reflation is good inflation, it’s a proxy for economic growth and it’s what the global economy has been waiting for for over a decade,” said Douglas Coté, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management.

 HDLPC: US rate hike keeps pressure on pricing as loan funds’ assets grow   WC559 words   PD17 March 2017   ET14:41   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPNEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Investors seeking to offset the effects of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike on Wednesday are pouring money into US loan funds, which is expected to keep a US$208bn refinancing wave rolling as new leveraged loans remain in short supply.

Cash is flowing into bank loan mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen 18 weeks of inflows as investors buy floating-rate debt to secure higher yields and effectively hedge against further interest rate rises.
   TDWith few new buyout loans to invest in, borrowers have been able to use the unsatisfied demand to slash pricing on existing loans, which are being refinanced at a rate not seen since the second quarter of 2013 when refinancing hit a record US$245.65bn.

"Inflows remain very strong, which will keep the pressure on spreads and create opportunities for repricings," said Jonathan Insull, portfolio manager at Crescent Capital Group. “Repricings tend to come in waves, and we have had a couple of tsunamis roll through here. Until we see heavier new issuance or inflows abate, it won't be safe to go near the water."

The Federal Reserve, which raised its target rate by 25bp to 75-100bp on Wednesday in the third rise since December 2015, said it expects two further increases this year and three in 2018.

Loan inflows of US$11.1bn so far this year follow $8.6bn of inflows in 2016, which reversed a combined outflow of more than US$45bn in 2014 and 2015. There was a record annual inflow of US$62.9bn in 2013.

“Institutional interest in the asset class continues to be strong globally, so we continue to see demand,” said John Popp, global head and chief investment officer of the credit investments group at Credit Suisse Asset Management.

The influx of cash is boosting the assets under management of bank loan mutual funds and ETFs. Assets increased 4% to US$146bn in February from January, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.

Investors seek floating-rate products, such as leveraged loans that pay lenders a coupon over Libor, in a rising interest rate environment as yields increase along with rates, unlike fixed-rate bonds, where returns fall as rates rise.

Inflows into loan funds are a “natural reaction to the expectation of not only seeing dividends move up, but also protecting your capital when invested in fixed income,” said Jeff Bakalar, co-head of Voya Investment Management’s senior loan group.

Bank loan funds are attracting global investors that face low or negative rates in various other regions. Some funds have been increasing existing loan allocations while others have even been reducing their longer duration bond allocations and moving into loans, Bakalar said.

High-yield bond funds have had three consecutive weeks of outflows, including US$5.7bn in the seven days ending March 15, according to Lipper.

“If you look at the history of Fed rate hikes, typically ahead of the move you will see inflows into the loan market and outflows from high-yield bonds, so [the last few weeks] is inline with history,” said Brad Rogoff, head of credit strategy at Barclays.

 HDDollar Falls After Fed Signals Restraint --- Central bank indicates rate rises will arrive more gradually than investors anticipated   BYBy Ira Iosebashvili and Saumya Vaishampayan    WC760 words   PD17 March 2017   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGB12   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPThe dollar suffered broad losses Thursday, extending its retreat after the Federal Reserve signaled it would raise interest rates more slowly than some investors had come to expect.

With the dollar losing ground against the euro, yen and several emerging-market currencies, The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index sank to its lowest level since early February.
   TDThe movement marked the latest setback for investors who expected the dollar would rise this year as the Fed stepped up the pace of rate increases. Wagering on a stronger dollar has become a popular trade on Wall Street even after a significant period of U.S. currency appreciation, reflecting in part the widespread investor expectation that the Trump administration will enact policies that boost U.S. growth and limit trade. But when these expectations aren't fully met, sharp retreats can ensue.

"This looks to be more about positioning than a change in direction," said Christian Lawrence, senior market strategist at Rabobank.

Thursday's drop left the WSJ Dollar Index down 2.5% for this year, even after the Fed on Wednesday raised its federal-funds rate to a range of 0.75% to 1%. Higher rates tend to buoy the dollar by making it more attractive to yield-seeking investors.

The retreat is an acute surprise for those betting on a dollar revival because many investors saw signs earlier this month that the Fed was turning hawkish. A fresh round of solid U.S. economic data and comments from Fed speakers that pointed to a March interest-rate increase -- three months earlier than the consensus expectation heading into this month -- lifted the dollar for the first two weeks of March.

But the central bank's policy statement Wednesday was deemed by many analysts to be in keeping with the Fed's cautious tone throughout the postcrisis period. The central bank has raised rates only once in each of the past three years, after leaving them on hold for years.

The market is also weighing if the White House can make good on its fiscal stimulus plan of a new tax regime, business deregulation and infrastructure spending.

Analysts say that one proposed change to tax policy, which incentivizes U.S. companies to bring back cash held abroad, would likely give the dollar a short-term boost even if the economy slows or interest rates don't rise quickly.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has laid out plans to overhaul the tax code by August. But questions remain about whether Congress will get behind the plan, and President Donald Trump has focused more on immigration and other issues at the start of his term.

The WSJ Dollar Index closed down 0.2% at 90.65, its lowest level since Feb. 8. The dollar touched 19.05 against the Mexican peso, a four-month low. It also declined against the Turkish lira and the Russian ruble. Gold for March delivery closed up 2.2% at $1,226.50 a troy ounce, the biggest rise since last June.

The euro rose to $1.0768, its highest level since Feb. 3. The currency has lost about 4% of its value against the dollar since October, when markets started betting on tighter monetary policy in the U.S.

The dollar's yearslong move higher has left the greenback looking expensive, some analysts said. One gauge of a currency's value is its real effective exchange rate, or REER, which measures a country's exchange rate against several trading partners, adjusted for inflation.

The dollar's REER is currently higher than both its five- and 10-year averages, according to the Bank for International Settlements. While currencies can trade above and below their long-run valuations for extended periods, it underscores the extent of the dollar's rally.

The real effective exchange rates for both the euro and yen are below their five- and 10-year averages, suggesting they are cheap.

Yet with U.S. economic growth picking up and the Fed indicating more interest-rate increases this year, many believe the dollar can resume a rally that sent it to a 14-year high in January. U.S. single-family housing starts in February hit their highest level since the recession, Commerce Department data showed Thursday.

"Investors are likely to see this decline as a buying opportunity," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.

   LPCentral banks around the world are signaling a move away from ultra-easy money, but financial markets are responding as if the low-interest-rate party isn't stopping.

A day after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point, the People's Bank of China raised a suite of key short-term interest rates and the Bank of England signaled that an increase in rates may not be far off. Turkey also raised a lending rate, while central banks in Japan, Norway and Indonesia held rates steady.
   TDThe events marked a striking turn from the low-interest-rate policies many central banks ushered in as recently as last year to spur markets and slow-growing economies. Low rates make it cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow, spend and invest and tend to push up the value of asset prices like stocks.

Markets sometimes shudder at the prospect of higher borrowing costs, but that isn't happening now. U.K. stocks ended at a record Thursday, and European and Asian indexes rallied.

Following Wednesday's Fed meeting, U.S. stocks climbed, benchmark bond yields sank and the dollar slid. Global stock markets as a whole have rallied over the past half year. The Dow Jones Global Index, which tracks 47 developed and emerging countries, has gained 9.7% since mid-September.

The reaction can be seen as a sign of growing confidence that global growth is picking up, lessening the need for central banks to prop up spending and investing with low rates.

The Bank of England held its benchmark interest rate steady at 0.25% Thursday.

Minutes of deliberations revealed signs of growing unease about the BOE's easy-money stance. One rate-setter on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voted for an immediate increase in the BOE's benchmark rate to 0.5%.

China raised several short-term interest rates for the second time this year, just hours after the Federal Reserve's latest monetary tightening.

The nearly simultaneous rate increase showed Beijing's desire to prevent capital from flowing outside the country toward places like the U.S. Higher rates are meant to tempt investors to keep deposits parked in domestic banks. Beijing is also trying to cool booming domestic markets.

Investors liken cheap money to a punchbowl at a cocktail party: Guests help themselves to as little or as much as they like, until someone takes the punchbowl away and ends the party.

The Fed started draining its punchbowl in December 2015 by raising its benchmark federal-funds off zero for the first time in seven years. It raised rates by a quarter-percentage point in 2016 and a third time this week.

Interest rates remain low by historical standards, but this week's rate increase moved the U.S. central bank into a new, more aggressive phase of withdrawing easy money from the financial system as the economy improves.

Central banks in other major economies are lagging behind but still seem to be moving in the same direction as the Fed.

"Places like the euro area are where the U.S. was maybe three years ago, so moving in the right direction, things are getting better, but still a ways to go," said Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last week left the central bank's policies in place and indicated that the ECB probably won't need to enact fresh stimulus.

Developments in the U.S. show how exuberant markets are offsetting central banks' shift away from easy money.

Even though the Fed raised rates Wednesday, U.S. financial conditions eased by the equivalent of a quarter-percentage-point rate cut, according to a Goldman Sachs index that measures the cumulative effect of stock, bond and currency movements on overall financial conditions.

Analysts attributed the U.S. reaction to the fact that the Fed stuck with its projection for nudging rates higher two more times in 2017. The Fed still sees inflation rising gradually back toward its 2% target.

 HDRising U.S. Rates Could Mean Hard Fall for Some Currencies   BYBy Saumya Vaishampayan    WC554 words   PD17 March 2017   ET08:13   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPFederal Reserve officials this week signaled that the end is near for a long-distance relationship that has lasted 16 years.

The link in question is the difference between Australian and U.S. interest rates, which has been positive since 2001. As the Fed raised short-term rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday, it projected two more such increases in 2017: If it carries through, the upper end of the target range for U.S. rates will be 1.5% by the year's end--where Australia's benchmark rate is now.
   TDThe closing U.S.-Australian rate gap is a standout example of a trend currently looming over foreign-exchange markets: the narrowing difference between U.S. and global interest rates. While the Fed is now in tightening mode, many central banks that have long had higher benchmark rates--such as those in Australia, India and Brazil--are on hold or cutting.

Currency players often seek to profit from interest-rate gaps, known as the "carry," by investing in stocks, bonds and currencies in countries with higher rates. Now, rising U.S. rates could trigger a reversal of such capital flows, which could prove destabilizing for countries that had benefited from the search for yield during the years when U.S. rates have been ultralow.

The Australian dollar, for example, could tumble by around 15% from its current level against the greenback if the country's central bank keeps rates on hold, according to London-based Capital Economics. It expects the Reserve Bank of Australia to stand pat until 2019 at the earliest.

Moves in the euro in 2014 show how changing interest-rate differentials can result in bad blood for currencies.

The European Central Bank pushed its key interest rate negative in June 2014, while the Fed's target range for its benchmark rate stayed between 0% and 0.25%. The gap between the two regions' rates has since widened, as the U.S. has started tightening. The euro dropped 12% against the dollar in 2014, 10% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"We saw the damage that it can do," said Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Bank Limited, pointing to the euro's exchange rate. "It provides one more reason for someone to sell and one fewer reason for someone to own," he added.

Some investors are sanguine about the impact of narrowing interest-rate gaps, arguing that other factors can influence currencies. A rebound in commodity prices and solid economic data in China, a major trading partner, have brightened Australia's outlook, helping propel the Aussie to a gain of 6.5% this year against the U.S. dollar.

And even as the Fed pushes ahead with rate increases, the currencies of some countries could remain attractive as their interest rates remain much higher, investors and strategists say.

They recommend owning high-yield darlings like the Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee, where benchmark rates are 4.75% and 6.25%, respectively, providing a substantial buffer against rising U.S. rates.

 HDWhat the Fed rate rise will mean for US consumers   BYAlistair Gray in New York    WC901 words   PD16 March 2017   ET11:16   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

   LPAmericans face another hit to their wallets in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate rise. US banks are set to push up borrowing costs on credit cards and other types of loan while keeping interest rates on saving products largely unchanged. Here’s how banks are likely to respond to the central bank’s move — and what it means for consumers.

Credit cards and consumer loans
   TDWithin minutes of the Fed’s quarter point increase, lenders including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and US Bank said they would lift their “prime rates”, which are used to determine borrowing costs on several types of loan.

These rates  have gone up from 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent, tracking the Fed. The most immediate impact will be on customers who borrow on their credit cards and have taken out home equity loans. These types of loan are pegged directly to the prime rates. US consumers will pay about $1.6bn in additional credit card charges this year as a result, WalletHub estimates.

But even after the Fed’s third increase in little more than a year, interest rates remain low by historic standards. Still borrowing costs are expected to rise further after policymakers pointed to another two rises in 2017. “The story here is the trend,” says Sean McQuay, credit cards expert at Nerdwallet. “Debt is getting more expensive.”

He warns that borrowers could be in for a nasty surprise. “Banks have no obligation to tell the consumer that interest rates are changing if it’s because of the Fed.” There are also concerns about the impact of higher borrowing costs on delinquency levels. The US credit card default rate reached 3.21 per cent in January — the highest level since July 2013, according to S&P/Experian figures.

Higher rates will also fuel concern about the car market. The average loan amount for a new vehicle reached a record high of $30,600 at the end of last year, according to Experian. “Rising interest rates are a concern for the automotive industry as loan amounts and monthly payments continue to reach record highs,” says Melinda Zabritski, senior director for Experian Automotive. “Increased rates will continue to impact affordability.”

Deposits

Savers who have been putting up with rock-bottom interest rates are unlikely to get much respite soon. Since the Fed’s previous rate rise in December, the best available online savings account offer on the market has edged up only a bit — from 1.1 per cent to 1.25 per cent, according to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. And many banks have not improved their deals at all.

Markets reckon that banks will — at least for now — be able to hold off on raising saving rates. This partly explains why share prices in the US retail banking sector have performed so well recently, up 28 per cent overall since November. The question is when the pressure will mount. “Each additional hike by the Fed represents more water building behind the damn that will ultimately spill over into broad-based improvement,” Mr McBride adds.

Some analysts have said the rise of digital banks, and the relative ease of transferring cash online, could make competition for deposits more intense. There has been little sign of that so far, however. Bank of America, for instance, paid an average 0.08 per cent interest on US deposits last year — the same as it did in 2015.

“It’s going to take a couple more hikes to begin to see deposit rates move [significantly] higher,” says Jason Goldberg, banking analyst at Barclays.

This equation could change if banks see more profitable opportunities for lending, which could lead to a fight for funds. “A pick-up in loan growth — or an accelerated Fed hike cycle — would be the biggest factors that could lead to broader deposit price competition,” says Ken Usdin at Jefferies.

Mortgages

The impact on mortgage rates is more nuanced. These rates do not necessarily move in tandem with central bank actions and are instead based on longer term interest rates.

On Wednesday the yield on the 10-year US Treasury, which is correlated with mortgage borrowing costs, fell to 2.5 per cent in its biggest intraday drop since November.

Yet before the Fed’s latest meeting, mortgage rates had risen sharply: the average 30-year fixed mortgage is priced at 4.1 per cent, up from 3.51 per cent at the start of November, according to Bankrate.com.

Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors: “Over the long term things move in the same direction — we’re in a rising interest rate environment, which will begin to nudge up the 30-year fixed rate mortgage.”

Michael Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, adds: “If you’re looking to buy, there’s an argument to do so sooner rather later. Wait another year and rates are likely to be higher. It’s not going to get less expensive by waiting.”

A survey of more than 2,500 people this month by Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices found more than half of homeowners and about 80 per cent of prospective buyers said they would be concerned about the affordability of buying a house if rates were to rise further.

 HD Federal Reserve  happy to walk into a run of  interest rate  rises   BYRobin Wigglesworth, Joe Rennison and Nicole Bullock in New York    WC836 words   PD16 March 2017   ET11:38   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

   LPWhen Romeo impatiently hankered after Juliet, the sage friar Lawrence dispensed some valuable advice: “Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.” It is a dictum the Federal Reserve clearly intends to live by, despite the improving economic outlook .

There have been rising murmurs in financial markets that after years of the Fed being too optimistic on the economy, inflation and interest rates, it is now behind the curve. But on Wednesday the US central bank sent a clear message  to markets that it is not in a hurry to tighten monetary policy.
   TDThe Fed did deliver another quarter-point interest rate increase, only the third in the cycle that started in December 2015. Yet investors who had begun to position themselves for a faster pace of rate increases were wrongfooted by officials electing to leave most of their headline projections in place.

“It comes off as very dovish,” said John Brady, managing director at RJ O’Brien, a brokerage. “This is going to be a friendly, docile, dovish hiking cycle. At least in the here and now.”

As the dust settled on Thursday, the 10-year Treasury note yield was trading around 2.53 per cent and remained below this week’s peak of 2.63 per cent. The policy-sensitive two-year Treasury has also eased back to around 1.34 per cent, reflecting market relief that Fed officials at this juncture do not see a need to accelerate the pace of tightening.

“Positioning was clearly short,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock.

Highlighting how some investors were wrongfooted, Prattle, a data company popular with hedge funds that uses algorithms to score central bank speeches and statements as hawkish or dovish, graded the Fed announcement as “neutral” despite its models predicting tougher language.

“It is obvious by the move and the language that the [Fed] feels that it is in control and its monetary policy is correct,” said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income at Raymond James, who felt the caution was appropriate. “Say what you want, there are many geopolitical uncertainties out there to deal with, along with a free-falling price of oil and very uncharted waters on the political front.”

The delivery of a “dovish rise” — the rate increase tempered by unchanged projections for two further quarter-point increases this year — also helped boost the US equity market.

The shift in the Fed funds futures market, which has been more sceptical of an aggressive central bank, was less dramatic. The implied odds on another two rate increases this year dipped from 60 per cent to 51 per cent, and the chances of three more slipped from 24 per cent to 18 per cent.

A still-cautious, unhurried Fed has eased concerns of a re-run of “Three Steps and a Stumble”, a Wall Street adage based on the tendency of the stock market to be tripped up by the third interest rate increase in a raising cycle. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said investors have also been reassured by President Donald Trump’s plans to slash corporate taxes.

“We talked forever about the Fed put. Now we have a tax cut put,” he added. “There are great expectations about what this tax plan will involve. People are of the belief that a slight tightening of money will be OK because companies will get it back in the form of a little bit more up front from lower corporate taxes.”

The US mortgage bond market was also pleased by the Fed meeting. While Janet Yellen, who chairs the Fed, said board members had discussed how and when to begin trimming the central bank’s balance sheet — which holds $1.76tn of mortgage-backed securities — the lack of any details reassured investors. The biggest exchange traded fund that tracks the MBS market rallied the most in nearly four years after the Fed decision.

Walter Schmidt, head of mortgage strategy at FTN Financial says: “I think the mortgage market is reading into the lack of news about the balance sheet that another meeting has gone by until they will consider it again.”

Nonetheless, markets should avoid excessive complacency. While the headline forecasts did not change, nine out of 17 Fed officials are looking for three rises this year, up from six in December.

It is also only March, which leaves the Fed plenty of time to move more aggressively should it become appropriate. Indeed, the fact that financial conditions eased sharply on a day when the Fed raised interest rates will encourage the central bank’s more hawkish members.

“They’re in no hurry to raise rates but they’re data dependent and if the data continues to be strong then they’ll move faster,” says Frederic Mishkin, an economics professor at Columbia Business School and former member of the Fed’s board of governors.

   LPThe fervour of US company bosses for Donald Trump's growth agenda is tinged with dread. The Federal Reserve has raised its short-term interest rate range by 25 basis points to between 0.75 per cent and 1 per cent. This will increase interest costs. Managers must raise earnings to sleep comfortably, as the interest they must pay to finance their bloated balance sheets rises.

The dangers are obvious. Moody's estimates the leverage for speculative grade issuers (those with bonds rated lower than triple B) is higher than at any time since at least 2005. Outstanding debt amounts to 5 times companies' earnings before interest, tax and depreciation.
   TDThe good news is that banks are less exposed to defaults than they were to the housing crisis. They still prefer mortgage-backed securities to corporate bonds as collateral for short-term funding markets.

Instead insurers and pension funds have been piling into higher-yielding credit, including corporate debt markets, to escape low interest rates elsewhere. Private equity firms, have done their bit to swell the debt mountain - assets under management reached a record $2.5tn in June last year, according to research firm Preqin.

The Fed's trajectory for rate rises is gentler than feared. The data emerging from highly leveraged sectors are not immediately worrying anyway. Default rates are expected to decline further this year. Even speculative grade companies can cover their interest expenses twice from earnings before interest and tax. The energy sector has just gone through an oil-price induced default cycle, forcing companies to clean up their balance sheets. And higher short-term rates will not immediately raise funding costs.

But flushing record leverage from the system painlessly will be a delicate operation. Companies must delever so their earnings can support higher interest rates. Mr Trump's tax plan could provide an incentive by abolishing the tax deductibility of interest payments. The debt taper needs to happen before wage inflation or earnings deceleration raises financial distress. Default rates will only remain low this year if monetary tightening is gradual. The blame for the financial crisis fell on greedy mortgage bankers. As rates rise, the real economy will be the culprit although, as targets go, it is harder to get angry with.

   LPThe US central bank has increased short-term interest rates for the third time since the financial crisis, stepping up the pace of tightening as policy-makers grow ever more confident that the recovery will lift inflation.

The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent, in a move that has come earlier than markets had been expecting as recently as last month.
   TDTreasury prices rallied, the dollar sank and US stocks extended early gains after the move as the Fed defied expectations in some quarters that it would signal a more aggressive rate rise path.

Policymakers stuck with median projections that there will be a total of three increases in rates this year. One rate-setter dissented from the vote for a rise, arguing in favour of unchanged rates.

Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, signalled in Chicago this month that the Federal Open Market Committee thought monetary policy had reached a turning point that would require rate rises to come more frequently than the once-a-year pace set in 2015 and 2016.

Among the factors underpinning the new confidence are employment and inflation approaching the Fed's targets, a reduction in perceived risks overseas, and an ebullient mood in stock markets.

In its statement, the Fed signalled it was becoming more confident about inflation, noting that headline price growth had moved close to its 2 per cent objective, even if its favoured meas-ure of core inflation remains lower.

Noting "solid" job gains, the statement also highlighted an improvement in business investment. The risks to the outlook remained "roughly balanced" it said, mirroring recent language.

However, the Fed has not ditched its cautious approach to monetary normalisation, with its post-meeting statement reiterating guidance that further rate increases will be gradual.

The "dot plot" projections pointed to a quicker pace of tightening than the once-a-year speed set over the past two years, but the Fed forecasts remain shy of predictions by some forecasters that there might be four increases this year.

The median interest-rate projection for the end of 2017 was centred at 1.375 per cent, unchanged from December's outlook. The forecast was centred at 2.125 per cent in 2018, also the same as December's prediction, and at 3 per cent in 2019, a shade higher than before.

Fed policymakers' forecasts for growth and inflation remained little changed, with growth tipped to be 2.1 per cent this year and next year, slipping to 1.9 per cent in 2019. Core inflation is set to be 1.9 per cent in 2017 and 2 per cent in the two following years.

The possibility of looser fiscal policy has triggered speculation that the central bank will have to further accelerate its rate-rising, but a number of policymakers insist they want to see firmer plans from Congress before making a call on the impact of possible tax cuts.

 SEEconomy   HDChina Raises Some Key Short-Term Interest Rates, Following Fed Closely; The PBOC increase came just hours after the Fed announced its rate rise   BYBy Shen Hong    WC851 words   PD16 March 2017   ET07:09   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

   LPSHANGHAI—China raised a suite of key short-term interest rates for the second time since late January, just hours after the Federal Reserve's latest monetary tightening, reinforcing Beijing's perceived policy priority to boost its currency's appeal and cool domestic asset inflation.
   TDThe unprecedented, nearly simultaneous rate increase following the Fed's decision betrays Beijing's sense of urgency to prevent capital outflows from accelerating. It also shows Beijing's desire to keep risks in its financial system from generating crises in a weak economy, analysts say.

The unexpectedly close gap between the two central banks' moves also offers a fresh indication of just how intertwined policy-making in the world's two largest economies has become.

Minutes before domestic financial markets opened, the People's Bank of China announced that it has raised the interest rates it charges commercial banks in the money market on the seven-day, 14-day and 28-day loans each by 0.1 percentage point. These rates are also known as reverse repurchase agreements, or repos.

As a result, the central bank pushed the benchmark seven-day repo rate to 2.45% from 2.35%. That followed an identical move on Feb. 3, after the PBOC had kept the borrowing cost unchanged since October 2015.

Separately, the PBOC also raised the interest rate by 0.1 percentage point on a form of special loans to 22 financial institutions known as a medium-term lending facility, for the second time since Jan. 24.

In a statement explaining the moves, the PBOC said the rate increases reflect "strengthening market expectations" for higher funding costs in light of a recovering Chinese economy and the Federal Reserve's recent rate increases.

"Besides the tough task of cutting leverage in the economy, the PBOC's decision also reflects a hope to keep the interest rate gap between China and the U.S. at an appropriate level, so as to avoid pressure on the yuan and capital flows," said Liu Dongliang, senior economist at China Merchants Bank.

Since the country's worst stock market crash in 2015, Chinese leaders have repeatedly vowed to rein in debt-fueled speculative investment that has inflated prices in the past year for everything from bonds to iron ore and garlic, risks that could wreak havoc in the economy in the long run.

While most investors had anticipated a catch-up move by Beijing following the latest Fed hike, many didn't expect it to be so soon.

"It was a surprise to me. I thought the post-Fed rallies on Wall Street and in U.S. Treasurys would mean the PBOC could afford to wait a big longer," said the Shanghai-based head of bond trading at an Asian bank.

But to others, global markets' positive reaction overnight actually provided a perfect opportunity for China's central bank to pull the trigger.

"It would have certainly been a disaster if the PBOC had raised rates during a market selloff," said Zhu Chaoping, China economist at UOB Kay Hian Holdings Ltd., a Singapore investment bank.

In addition, the likelihood of Chinese markets joining the global rally might have made the PBOC concerned that if it didn't act fast enough, its key policy message of reducing corporate and economic leverage might not be taken seriously enough, Mr. Zhu added.

Chinese markets jumped on the bandwagon indeed: the Shanghai stock market was up 0.7% at midday, while the yield on the 10-year government bonds fell 4.47 basis points at 3.31%. The yuan also rose against the dollar to 6.8949 from Wednesday's close of 6.9135.

However, in a seemingly contradictory gesture, the PBOC stressed that its latest rate increases don't amount to a formal interest-rate hike, which in China is defined only as raising the official deposit and lending rates.

"There are many tools in the central bank's toolbox. There's no need to read too much into the size and price of each (money market) operation," the PBOC said in the statement.

Analysts say this reflects the PBOC's ultimate dilemma: while it intends to use higher interest rates to cool a debt-fueled investment boom, aggressive monetary tightening is the last thing a slowing economy needs.

That is why Beijing has demonstrated a growing preference for using short-term measures, such as adjusting money-market rates, rather than blunter instruments such as policy interest rates to help achieve its various goals.

"It's mission impossible but the central bank doesn't have a choice," Mr. Zhu said.

 SEMarkets   HDDespite U.S. Rate Increases, the Dollar's Biggest Gains Look Done for Now; The U.S. is no longer the sole bright spot in the global economy   BYBy Saumya Vaishampayan    WC787 words   PD16 March 2017   ET10:27   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPThe Federal Reserve may be well set on its interest-rate raising course this year, but gains in the dollar could prove harder to come by.

The key reason why the dollar's gains are slowing: The U.S. is no longer the sole bright spot in the global economy. Sure, the world's largest economy has recovered enough for the Fed to start normalizing interest rates after years of near-zero levels.
   TDBut the eurozone is now growing faster than the U.S. In Japan, where officials have resorted to unorthodox measures in the past five years to stoke inflation, prices are finally rising slightly. Both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged at their latest meetings. In China, economic data has been solid so far this year.

"As the rest of the world catches up to the U.S. in terms of tapering and hiking rates, the dollar will lose its luster," said Kisoo Park, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Hong Kong, adding that he still expects the dollar to rise this year.

The dollar continued to fall in Asian trading hours on Thursday, having dropped after the Fed overnight raised U.S. rates by a quarter percentage point and signaled it would keep raising rates cautiously this year. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the currency against six others, was recently down 1.1% since late Tuesday.

That move seems to contradict common economic wisdom, which dictates that as the U.S. raises rates before other major global central banks, the divergence should boost the dollar. Higher interest rates tend to boost the allure of a country's assets, which in turn tends to attract capital.

While that may yet prove true, the U.S. currency's already sizable advance since 2012 may lead to diminishing future returns, some investors say.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index has risen each year since 2012. The bulk of the rally happened in 2014 and 2015, when the index advanced by 12.8% and 9.3%, respectively; in 2016, it gained 3.6%. More than half the index's weight comes from the euro, followed by the Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.

The scene was different during the great dollar surge of 2014-2015. While the Fed had just started winding down its post-financial crisis bond-buying program, central banks in Japan and Europe were busy buying up government bonds to stimulate their persistently sluggish economies, keeping bond yields low globally.

"The fundamentals—the U.S. economy outperforming the rest of the world—in that situation could only be reflected in the currency market," said James Kwok, head of currency management for Amundi Asset Management in London.

Now, with economic growth looking brighter in several regions, "it's difficult to find a lot of relative value in currencies," he said.

The yearslong move higher in the U.S. dollar has left it looking expensive. One gauge of a currency's value is its real effective exchange rate, or REER, which measures a country's exchange rate against several trading partners, adjusted for inflation.

The dollar's REER is currently higher than both its five- and 10-year averages, according to the Bank for International Settlements. While currencies can trade above and below their long-run valuations for extended periods, it underscores the extent of the dollar's rally.

Meanwhile, the real effective exchange rates for both the euro and yen are below their five- and 10-year averages, suggesting they are cheap.

For sure, there are other factors that could push the dollar higher this year.

Changes to U.S. tax policy, especially any that provide incentives for companies to bring the cash they have stashed abroad back into the U.S., could yet be a game changer for the dollar. If U.S. companies repatriate those earnings, the resulting flow of money could boost the dollar regardless of the economic outlook. President Donald Trump has talked about lowering the corporate tax rate, and his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has laid out plans to overhaul the tax code by August.

 SEEconomy   HDIndonesia's Central Bank Keeps Key Rate on Hold; Bank Indonesia maintains benchmark repo rate at 4.75%   BYBy I Made Sentana    WC252 words   PD16 March 2017   ET12:42   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPJAKARTA, Indonesia—Bank Indonesia left interest rates unchanged Thursday even as the \b Federal Reserve\b0  raised U.S. borrowing costs, opting to maintain its support for the economy while ensuring stability in the local currency.

Indonesia's central bank kept the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate at 4.75% for the fifth consecutive month.
   TDThe decision was in line with expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

After an aggressive run of six interest-rate cuts last year, Indonesia's central bank has become reluctant to lower rates further to lift economic growth, focusing instead on rising inflation. Additional rate cuts would also likely renew pressure on the Indonesian rupiah, which has weakened against the dollar since Donald Trump's election victory and the Fed's tightening cycle.

Many economists now expect BI rates to remain at the current level for the rest of the year, given that the Fed didn't signal an acceleration of rate increases in its guidance to markets.

"The decision is in line with Bank Indonesia's efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability," Indonesian central bank spokesman Tirta Segara said.

The rupiah initially rose sharply against the dollar after the Fed's guidance proved more dovish than expected, removing the need for Bank Indonesia to raise rates to prop up the local currency.

 HDAverage US 30-year mortgage rate rises to 4.30 percent   WC359 words   PD16 March 2017   ET15:47   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2017.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose this week for a second straight week, posting new highs for the year. The markets were anticipating an increase in a key interest rate by the Federal Reserve, which the Fed announced Wednesday.

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the rate on 30-year, fixed-rate loans climbed to 4.30 percent from 4.21 percent last week. The benchmark rate stood at 3.73 percent a year ago and averaged 3.65 percent through 2016, the lowest level in records dating to 1971.
   TDThe rate on 15-year mortgages increased to 3.50 percent from 3.42 percent last week.

The Fed's move marked the second time in three months that the central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate. The Fed also forecast two additional hikes this year. The Fed action reflects a consistently solid U.S. economy and will likely mean higher rates on some consumer and business loans.

The key short-term rate is rising by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. The Fed said in a statement that a strengthening job market and rising prices had moved it closer to its targets for employment and inflation.

To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.

The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged this week at 0.5 point. The fee on 15-year loans also remained at 0.5 point.

Rates on adjustable five-year loans rose to 3.28 percent from 3.23 percent last week. The fee held at 0.4 point.

 HDBanking & Finance: Fed's Path Puts Pressure on Beijing   BYBy Rachel Rosenthal in Hong Kong and Shen Hong in Shanghai    WC533 words   PD16 March 2017   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGB10   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPCentral banks in the U.S. and China are both on the road to higher interest rates. While their reasons might look different, their moves are also closely linked.

In the U.S., a burst of positive economic data spurred the Federal Reserve to raise rates for the second time in three months on Wednesday and penciled in two more rate increases for this year. Wages are climbing and unemployment is falling, while consumer and business confidence is strengthening.
   TDIn China, officials are concerned about rampant asset bubbles, fed by a gush of cheap, postfinancial-crisis cash that found its way to investments from stocks and bonds to artwork and real estate. The People's Bank of China has put taming financial risks and tightening the spigot of credit at the top of its to-do list for 2017.

But the Fed still looms large behind the Chinese central bank's domestic agenda. As the U.S. raises rates, expectations that the dollar will strengthen against the Chinese yuan have solidified, a force that could accelerate capital outflows from China. Beijing has spent nearly one-quarter of its foreign-exchange reserves since mid-2014 to keep the yuan's decline from spiraling out of control, and officials have taken measures to restrict the flow of money heading overseas.

This week's Fed rate increase could pressure the PBOC to step up its own pace of tightening, analysts say, and signal a shift in priorities for China's inward-looking market players.

?On Thursday, China's central bank raised a suite of key short-term interest rates for the second time since late January, attributing the move to shifting market expectations given the recovering domestic economy and the latest U.S. interest-rate tightening.

"Local investors used to only pay attention to domestic factors," said Ken Hu, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific fixed income at Invesco in Hong Kong. "Now, they've woken up and suddenly realize they need to pay attention to U.S. monetary policy."

The impact of tighter monetary conditions inside China is already evident in the domestic bond market. In early February, when China raised key short-term borrowing rates, the yield on China's benchmark 10-year government bond surged to 3.486%, its highest in a year and a half, according to Thomson Reuters. The level was last at 3.385%.

As bond yields rise it becomes more costly for Chinese companies to borrow at home. Some are currently finding it cheaper to raise debt outside China, denominated in U.S. dollars.

Chinese companies have raised $16.7 billion offshore so far this year, up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2016, according to Dealogic. That compares with $23.5 billion of debt issued inside China, down about 80% from the prior quarter.

The pressure on China's central bank to raise interest rates comes as officials are trying to strike a balance between tamping down on excessive credit while sustaining growth at around Beijing's 6.5% target.

   LPBEIJING (AP) — China's central bank raised short-term interest rates Thursday following the U.S. rate increase as Beijing tries to shore up the value of its currency and stanch an outflow of money.

The People's Bank of China raised the rate for its six-month and one-year medium-term lending facility and open-market repurchase operations by 0.1 percent. The benchmark one-year commercial lending rate was unchanged.
   TDBeijing faces a dilemma as it tries to defend the exchange rate of its yuan without depressing economic growth, which has been shored up by repeated infusions of credit.

Economists have warned the yuan would face further downward pressure if higher U.S. interest rates caused money to flow out of China in search of higher returns. Beijing has spent tens of billions of dollars to prop up the currency, also known as the renminbi, after investors began moving money out of China due to expectations its value would sink.

The People's Bank cited the U.S. Federal Reserve's Wednesday increase and "some signs of recovery" in China's own economy.

The mention of the U.S. rate hike "suggests that the PBOC may have been partly motivated by a desire to follow the Fed in order to avoid additional downward pressure on the renminbi," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.

   LPHercules Capital's Highly Asset Sensitive Debt Investment Portfolio to Generate Additional $0.02 of Net Investment Income Earnings Annually(1) from the Recent Increase in the Federal Reserve Benchmark Interest Rate


   -- 92.1% of Hercules' existing Debt Investment Portfolio is priced at 
      floating interest rates, as of December 31, 2016 
 
   -- 99.2% of the Company's outstanding debt liability obligations are fixed 
      rate, as of December 31, 2016 
 
   -- The Prime Rate is expected to increase from 3.75% to 4.00% 
 
   -- A 25 basis point increase in the Prime Rate is anticipated to generate 
      approximately $1.9 million, or $0.02 per share of additional Net 
      Investment Income or "NII" (1) 
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 16, 2017-- 
   TDHercules Capital, Inc. (NYSE:HTGC) ("Hercules" or the "Company"), the leading specialty finance company to innovative, venture growth, pre-IPO and M&A stage companies backed by leading venture capital firms, today announced the estimated accretive impact to its debt investment portfolio attributed to the Federal Reserve - Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") increase in the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25%.

Hercules anticipates a 25 basis point increase in the Prime Rate will contribute approximately $1.9 million, or $0.02 per share, of NII per annum, based on the basic weighted share outstanding as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, 92.1% of Hercules' debt investment portfolio of $1.38 billion, at cost, was primarily priced at PRIME or LIBOR-based floating interest rates, while 99.2% of the Company's outstanding debt obligations have a fixed rate of interest, well positioning Hercules for additional future rate increases. Given the expected increase to the Prime Rate will be taking effect in mid-March 2017, the anticipated increase is not expected to have any material impact to our NII in Q1 2017. The expected benefit from the March 2017 rate increase is expected to materialize throughout our 2017 operating period.

Based on Hercules' Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2016, the following table illustrates the approximate annualized increase in components of net income resulting from hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, such as prime rate, assuming no changes in the Company's investments and borrowings.

 SEEconomy   HDNorway's Central Bank Holds Benchmark Rate Steady; Norges Bank left main rate at 0.5% as expected   BYBy Dominic Chopping    WC234 words   PD16 March 2017   ET10:54   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPNorway's central bank held its benchmark interest rate unchanged Thursday, judging that by keeping the key policy rate close to the current level there are prospects that inflation will pick up, while an even lower rate could increase the risks of house prices and private debt levels rising too quickly.

The Norges Bank left its main rate at 0.5%, where it has been since March 2016, in a decision that was forecast by all analysts in a Wall Street Journal poll last week.
   TDThe central bank said it expected to keep its key rate close to the current level in the years ahead, and probably a little longer than projected earlier, while its forecasts imply a slightly higher probability of a rate cut than an increase in the coming period.

Investors judged the statement as slightly more dovish than expected, as the Norwegian krone fell against the euro, which has risen to 9.1633 Norwegian kroner from 9.0972 kroner immediately before the announcement.

The decision by the Norwegian monetary authority followed Wednesday's by the Federal Reserveto raise short-term interest rates, saying it remained on track to keep lifting them this year, signaling a new policy phase as the U.S. economy strengthens.

    * Cautious Fed sends dollar to 1-month low
    * Dutch election relief sparks strength in euro
    * Silver climbs to highest in a week

 (Adds comment, detail; updates prices)
    By Arpan Varghese
    March 16 (Reuters) - Gold hit a one-week high on Thursday
after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled a cautious stance on
interest rate policy this year, pushing the dollar to its lowest
in a month.
    The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates for the second
time in three months, with officials sticking to their outlook
for two more rate hikes this year and three more in 2018. 
            
    Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that the central bank would
stick to a gradual path of interest rate rises even if inflation
runs above its 2 percent target.             
    Spot gold        had risen 0.6 percent to $1,226.21 per
ounce at 0623 GMT after touching $1,226.95, the highest since
March 7, earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures         for
April delivery were up 2.1 percent at $1,226.3 an ounce.    
     "Yellen reiterated that future rate increases would be
'gradual', with this key word bestowing a dovish tone to the
outlook," said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.
    Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as
these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding
bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
    Recent rate hikes have seen gold decline in the run-up to an
increase, before recovering in its wake. Gold slumped to a
10-month low in mid-December after rates were increased for the
first time in a year, before turning around to post its
strongest increase in seven months in January.
    The dollar index        was down 0.2 percent at 100.74,
having earlier touched a one-month low.
    The euro strengthened against the U.S. currency after early
returns showed the Netherlands' centre-right Prime Minister Mark
Rutte had roundly seen off a challenge by anti-Islam, anti-EU
Geert Wilders in an election on Wednesday, a huge relief to
other EU governments facing a wave of nationalism.             
    "The market will be looking at the French election coming up
relatively soon," ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said. "However, we
would need to see the far right in particular really gather
strong resolve from those elections to see gold prices being
pushed even higher."
    Meanwhile, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's
largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.53 percent on
Wednesday.          
    Inflows into the fund so far this week have already nearly
erased last week's outflows.
    In other precious metals, spot silver        climbed 0.8
percent to $17.43 per ounce, after hitting its highest in a week
at $17.48 earlier in the session.
    Platinum        was up 1.68 percent at $964.99 per ounce,
close to $969.60, its highest since March 7, marked earlier in
the day. 
    Palladium        advanced 1.1 percent to $771.50 per ounce.

 HDHow Fed hike will affect mortgages, car loans, credit cards   BYBy CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER and ALEX VEIGA    CRAssociated Press Writers   WC1,550 words   PD16 March 2017   ET05:02   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2017.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — Are mortgage rates going up? How about car loans? Credit cards?

How about those nearly invisible rates on bank CDs — any chance of getting a few dollars more?
   TDWith the Federal Reserve having raised its benchmark interest rate Wednesday and signaled the likelihood of additional rate hikes later this year, consumers and businesses will feel it — if not immediately, then over time.

The Fed's thinking is that the economy is a lot stronger now than it was in the first few years after the Great Recession ended in 2009, when ultra-low rates were needed to sustain growth. With the job market in particular looking robust, the economy is seen as sturdy enough to handle modestly higher loan rates in the coming months and perhaps years.

"We are in a rising interest rate environment," noted Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit.

Here are some question and answers on what this could mean for consumers, businesses, investors and the economy:

___

Q. I'm thinking about buying a house. Are mortgage rates going to march steadily higher?

A. Hard to say. Mortgage rates don't usually rise in tandem with the Fed's increases. Sometimes they even move in the opposite direction. Long-term mortgages tend to track the rate on the 10-year Treasury, which, in turn, is influenced by a variety of factors. These include investors' expectations for future inflation and global demand for U.S. Treasurys.

When inflation is expected to stay low, investors are drawn to Treasurys even if the interest they pay is low, because high returns aren't needed to offset high inflation. When global markets are in turmoil, nervous investors from around the world often pour money into Treasurys because they're regarded as ultra-safe. All that buying pressure keeps a lid on Treasury rates.

Last year, for example, when investors worried about weakness in China and about the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, they piled into Treasurys, lowering their yields and reducing mortgage rates.

Since the presidential election, though, the 10-year yield has risen in anticipation that tax cuts, deregulation and increased spending on infrastructure will accelerate the economy and fan inflation. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has surged to 4.2 percent from last year's 3.65 percent average.

After the Fed's announcement Wednesday of its rate hike, the yield on the 10-year Treasury actually tumbled — from 2.60 percent to 2.49 percent. That decline suggested that investors were pleased that the Fed said it planned to act only gradually and not to accelerate its previous forecast of three rate hikes for 2017.

___

Q. So does that mean home-loan rates won't rise much anytime soon?

A. Not necessarily. Inflation is nearing the Fed's 2 percent target. The global economy is improving, which means that fewer international investors are buying Treasurys as a safe haven. And with two more Fed rate hikes expected later this year, the rate on the 10-year note could rise over time — and so, by extension, would mortgage rates.

It's just hard to say when.

Behravesh forecasts that the average 30-year mortgage rate will reach 4.5 percent to 4.75 percent by year's end, up sharply from last year. But for perspective, keep in mind: Before the 2008 financial crisis, mortgage rates never fell below 5 percent.

"Rates are still incredibly low," Behravesh said.

Even if the Fed raises its benchmark short-term rate twice more this year, as it forecast on Wednesday that it would, its key rate would remain below 1.5 percent.

"That's still in the basement," Behravesh said.

___

Q. What about other kinds of loans?

A. For users of credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other variable-interest debt, rates will rise by roughly the same amount as the Fed hike within 60 days, said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst. That's because those rates are based in part on banks' prime rate, which moves in tandem with the Fed.

"It's a great time to be shopping around if you have good credit and (can) lock in zero-percent introductory and balance-transfer offers," McBride said.

Those who don't qualify for such low-rate credit card offers may be stuck paying higher interest on their balances because the rates on their cards will rise as the prime rate does.

The Fed's rate hikes won't necessarily raise auto loan rates. Car loans tend to be more sensitive to competition, which can slow the rate of increases, McBride noted.

___

Q. At long last, will I now earn a better-than-measly return on my CDs and money market accounts?

A. Probably, though it will take time.

Savings, certificates of deposit and money market accounts don't typically track the Fed's changes. Instead, banks tend to capitalize on a higher-rate environment to try to thicken their profits. They do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers.

The exception: Banks with high-yield savings accounts. These accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors, McBride said. The only catch is that they typically require significant deposits.

"You'll see rates for both savings and auto loans trending higher, but it's not going to be a one-for-one correlation with the Fed," McBride said. "Don't expect your savings to improve by a quarter point or that all car loans will immediately be a quarter-point higher."

Ryan Sweet, director of Real Time Economics at Moody's Analytics, noted:

"Interest rates on savings accounts are still extremely low, but they're no longer essentially zero, so that may help boost confidence among retirees living on savings accounts."

___

Q. What's in store for stock investors?

A. Wall Street hasn't been spooked by the prospect of Fed rate hikes. Stock indexes rose sharply Wednesday after the Fed's announcement.

"The market has really come to view the rate hikes as actually a positive, not a negative," said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank.

That's because investors now regard the central bank's rate increases as evidence that the economy is strong enough to handle them.

Ultra-low rates helped underpin the bull market in stocks, which just marked its eighth year. But even if the Fed hikes three times this year, rates would still be low by historical standards.

Kravetz is telling his clients that the market for U.S. stocks remains favorable, though he cautions that the a pullback is possible, given how much the market has risen since President Donald Trump's November election.

___

Q. Why is the Fed raising rates? Is it trying to slam the brakes on economic growth?

A. No. The rate hikes are intended to withdraw the stimulus provided by ultra-low borrowing costs, which remained in place for seven years beginning in December 2008, when the Fed cut its short-term rate to near zero. The Fed acted in the midst of the Great Recession to spur borrowing, spending and investing.

The Fed's first two hikes — in December 2015 and a year later — appear to have had no negative effect on the economy. But that could change as rates march higher.

Still, Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said policymakers intend to prevent the economy from growing so fast as to boost inflation. If successful, the Fed's hikes could actually sustain growth by preventing inflation from rising out of control and forcing the central bank to have to raise rates too fast. Doing so would risk triggering a recession.

___

Q. Isn't Trump trying to speed up growth?

A. Yes. And that goal could pit the White House against the Fed in coming years. Trump has promised to lift growth to as high as 4 percent annually, more than twice the current pace. He also pledges to create 25 million jobs over a decade. Yet the Fed already considers the current unemployment rate — at 4.7 percent — to be at a healthy level. Any significant declines from there could spur inflation, according to the Fed's thinking, and require faster rate increases.

More rate hikes, in turn, could thwart Trump's plans — something he is unlikely to accept passively.

Under one scenario, the economy could grow faster without forcing accelerated rate hikes. If the economy became more productive, the Fed wouldn't have to raise rates more quickly. Greater productivity — more output for each hour worked — would mean that the economy had become more efficient and could expand without igniting price increases.

HONG KONG, March 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point for the second time in three months on Thursday, following a similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve and said capital outflows will not pose challenges for the economy.

While the Fed's move was widely anticipated, economists said the future path for tightening would be more gradual, sparking a rally in risky assets from stocks to emerging market currencies.

Norman Chan, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto central bank, said he was not worried about capital outflows, as they would happen naturally as U.S. interest rates rise.

"In the past couple of years, $130 billion came into the financial system and that is kept in a separate pocket we hold," Chan told a media gathering. "We have all the money in highly liquid form, such as U.S. Treasuries, that we hold ready for those who want U.S. dollars."

Shares in sub-indexes of banking and property companies in Hong Kong jumped by more than a percentage point each in opening trades on Thursday, outperforming the broader stock market on the benign rate outlook.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday raised the base rate charged through its overnight discount window by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent. Hong Kong tracks U.S. rate moves as its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Including reinvested dividends, the broader Hong Kong stock market has outperformed a sub-index of property and finance companies since the last U.S. rate increase in December.

HKMA's Chan also asked banks to continue upholding their high standards in examining applications for big loans from developers earmarking funds for bidding land for development.

The city's economy has become more dependent on the mainland at a time when Beijing authorities say meeting a target of 6.5 percent growth this year won't be easy.

More than three fourths of inbound tourists are from the mainland, a big source of revenue for local companies, and more than half of its trade is with China.

Hong Kong painted a slightly brighter outlook for the city last month, projecting its economy to expand between 2 to 3 percent in 2017, helped by stronger factors at home and the global economy.

Hong Kong's central bank sets its base rate through a formula that is 50 basis points above the prevailing U.S. Fed Funds Target or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs (Hong Kong Inter-bank Offered Rate). (Editing by Richard Borsuk and Randy Fabi)

 HDChina central bank says no change in its monetary policy after rate hike   WC181 words   PD16 March 2017   ET03:25   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPBEIJING, March 16 (Reuters) - China's central bank raised money market rates slightly on Thursday, but said the increase did not indicate a change in its monetary policy.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) increased key money market rates and rates on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans by 10 basis points on Thursday, its third increase in short-term rates in as many months.
   TDThe bank said the rate increase was market-driven, reflecting changes in supply and demand for capital at home and abroad.

The PBOC said the upward movement in short-term rates does not constitute a benchmark interest rate hike and that flexibility in rates is favourable for deleveraging, "deflating bubbles", and risk prevention.

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday lifted its target overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent.

 HDChina's Central Bank Raises Some Key Short-Term Interest Rates   BYBy Shen Hong    WC265 words   PD16 March 2017   ET03:59   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPSHANGHAI--China's central bank raised a suite of key short-term interest rates for the second time since late January, attributing the moves to shifting market expectations due to a recovering domestic economy and monetary tightening in the U.S.

The People's Bank of China raised the interest rates it charges commercial banks in the money market on the seven-day, 14-day and 28-day loans--also known as reverse repurchase agreements or repos--each by 0.1 percentage point.
   TDAs a result, the central bank pushed the benchmark seven-day repo rate to 2.45% from 2.35%. That followed an identical move on Feb. 3, after the PBOC had kept the borrowing cost unchanged since October 2015.

Simultaneously, the PBOC also raised the interest rate by 0.1 percentage point on a form of special loans to 22 financial institutions known as a medium-term lending facility, for the second time since Jan. 24.

In a statement explaining the moves, the PBOC said the rate increases reflect strengthening market expectations for higher funding costs in light of rising domestic inflation and property prices, in addition to the Federal Reserve's recent rate increases.

The PBOC stressed, however, that the rate increases don't equal a formal interest-rate increase, which in China is defined only as raising the official deposit and lending rates.

 HDPRECIOUS-Gold hits one-week high as Fed signals only gradual rate hikes   WC392 words   PD16 March 2017   ET02:13   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   TD
    March 16 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose to a one-week high on
Thursday as the dollar fell after the U.S. Federal Reserve stuck
to a less hawkish stance on further interest rate hikes this
year.
       
    FUNDAMENTALS
    * Spot gold        rose 0.3 percent to $1,222.20 per ounce,
the highest since March 7, at 0028 GMT.
    * U.S. gold futures         climbed 1.72 percent to
$1,221.3.
    * Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.53 percent to 839.43
tonnes on Wednesday from 834.99 tonnes on Tuesday.          
    * The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on
Wednesday for the second time in three months, a move spurred by
steady economic growth, strong job gains and confidence that
inflation is rising to the central bank's target.
    * However, the central bank said in its policy statement
that further hikes would only be "gradual," with officials
sticking to their outlook for two more rate hikes this year and
three more in 2018.                           
    * The dollar wallowed at a one-month low early on Thursday
after the Fed sounded less hawkish, while the euro stood tall as
Dutch election exit polls gave the country's prime minister a
big lead over his far-right rival. 
    * The dollar index against a basket of major currencies
extended losses from the previous day, when it slid more than 1
percent, to touch 100.490       , its lowest since Feb. 17.
    * The Netherlands' centre-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte
roundly saw off a challenge by anti-Islam, anti-EU Geert Wilders
in an election on Wednesday, early returns showed, a huge relief
to other EU governments facing a wave of nationalism.
            
    * Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is set to launch clearing
for London's benchmark gold price auction before participants
are ready as it races to prevent rivals muscling in on the
city's $5 trillion-a-year bullion market, market and banking
sources said.

 HDFed increases interest rates as inflation pressures loom   BYSam Fleming in Washington    WC917 words   PD15 March 2017   ET22:45   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

   LPThe US central bank has raised short-term interest rates  for only the third time since the financial crisis, stepping up the pace of tightening as policymakers grow increasingly confident that America’s enduring recovery will lift inflation.

The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent, in a move that has come earlier than markets were expecting as recently as last month.
   TDFed policymakers stuck with previous median projections that there will be a total of three increases in rates this year, defying predictions from some analysts that it would release a more aggressive set of rate-raising forecasts. One rate-setter — Neel Kashkari of the Minneapolis Fed — dissented from the vote for a rise, arguing in favour of unchanged rates.

In new language, the Fed’s statement also stressed that its inflation target is symmetric, in an acknowledgment that price growth could surpass its 2 per cent target without forcing the central bank to clamp down precipitately.

Treasury yields dived and the US dollar came under pressure immediately after the statement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, fell by as much as 10.7 basis points to 2.5 per cent, its biggest intraday drop since November 9, the day after the US election. The 2-year yield was down 7.9 basis point to 1.297 per cent.

The dollar index, which gauges the buck against a basket of half a dozen peers, was down by 1.1 per cent, as expectations of four rate rises were dashed.

Federal funds futures pinned the probability of four or more increases at 18.9 per cent at midday on Wednesday, down from 24.5 per cent on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg data. Odds of a June rate rise also retreated to 47 per cent, down from around 60 per cent on Tuesday.

Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, signalled in Chicago this month that the Federal Open Market Committee thought monetary policy has hit a turning point that would require rate rises to come more frequently than the once-a-year pace set in 2015 and 2016.

In a press conference, Ms Yellen suggested that the Fed’s economic and policy outlook had not changed substantially since December and emphasized that she was not going to rush to judgment about the impact of changes to tax and spending policy by Congress. While some analysts expect looser fiscal policy to boost the US economy next year, Ms Yellen said “we have plenty of time to see what happens”.

Among the factors that are underpinning the Fed’s confidence are employment and inflation data that are approaching its targets, a reduction for the time being in perceived risks overseas, and an ebullient mood in stock markets.

In its post-meeting statement, the US central bank signalled it was getting more confident about inflation, noting that headline price growth has moved close to its 2 per cent objective, even if its favoured measure of core inflation remains lower.

Highlighting “solid” job gains, the Fed’s statement also underscored an improvement in business investment compared with previous meetings. The risks to the outlook remain “roughly balanced” it said, mirroring recent language.

However, as Fed officials’ economic forecasts showed, the Fed has by no means ditched its cautious approach to monetary normalisation, with its post-meeting statement reiterating guidance that further rate increases will be gradual.

The so-called dot plot projections pointed to a quicker pace of tightening than the once-a-year speed set over the past two years, but the Fed forecasts remain shy of predictions by some forecasters that there could be four increases this year.

The median interest rate projection for the end of 2017 was centred at 1.375 per cent — unchanged from December’s outlook. The forecast was centred at 2.125 per cent in 2018, also the same as December’s prediction, and at 3 per cent in 2019, a shade higher than before. The median projection for the long-run rate remained at 3 per cent.

Fed policymakers’ forecasts for growth and inflation remained little changed, with growth tipped to be 2.1 per cent this year and next year, slipping to 1.9 per cent in 2019. Core inflation is set to be 1.9 per cent in 2017 and 2 per cent in the two following years.

The possibility of looser fiscal policy emerging from Congress has triggered speculation that the central bank will have to further accelerate its rate-rising campaign, but a number of policymakers are insistent that they want to see firmer plans emerging from Congress before making a call on the impact of possible tax cuts on the economy.

In her Chicago speech, Ms Yellen did not dwell on fiscal policy as she made the case for higher rates.

Also looming on the horizon is also the question of when and how to start reducing the size of the Fed’s $4.5tn balance sheet. The Fed’s stockpile of assets is a legacy of the financial crisis interventions that a growing number of policymakers have said now needs to be discussed.

In its statement, the Fed reiterated that it anticipates holding its balance sheet unchanged until normalisation of official rates is “well under way”.

 HDInvestors bet $9.6bn on a fall in bond prices   BYChris Flood    WC417 words   PD15 March 2017   ET07:00   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

   LPInvestors have placed bets worth around $9.6bn that bond prices will fall ahead of this week’s meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to lead to an increase in interest rates.

The bets on a fall in bond prices, which move inversely to interest rates, have been placed via three exchange traded funds  run by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager.
   TDThe value of short positions against the ETFs — essentially bets that bond prices will fall — has increased by $3.2bn since the start of March, according to S3 Partners, a US-based financial analytics provider.

Janet Yellen , who chairs the Federal Reserve, is expected to begin accelerating the pace of interest rate increases as the US central bank responds to an economy that is hitting maximum employment and inflation that is nearing target.

Bets against the largest US high-yield bond ETF, a BlackRock fund known as HYG, registered a 60 per cent increase this month to a record $6.4bn.

Short interest in LQD, a second BlackRock ETF that tracks the US investment-grade bond market, has surged 68 per cent higher since the start of March, to $1.2bn.

Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, said: “Traders are primarily using these three ETFs as hedges to protect against fixed income positions that will lose value when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.”

Bets against a third BlackRock fund known as TLT, which tracks US Treasury bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years, have increased 17 per cent to $2bn.

Derivative markets were last week pricing in a 98 per cent probability that the US central bank will raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points today, the first tightening of monetary policy under the presidency of Donald Trump.

Strong US employment data released on Friday has also strengthened expectations that the central bank will accelerate the pace of rate rises  this year.

The rise in ETF short positions coincides with the largest weekly redemptions from actively managed high-yield corporate bond funds since the US election in November.

High-yield corporate bond funds recorded $2.8bn of outflows in the week to March 8, according to EPFR, the data provider.

Passively managed ETFs linked to the US high-yield market have attracted interest so far this year, with net inflows of just under $1.5bn, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.

 HDUPDATE 1-Wall Street sees 2 more Fed rate hikes in 2017, at least 3 in 2018   WC607 words   PD15 March 2017   ET23:53   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LP(Updates throughout with results from one additional respondent)

NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's top banks see two additional interest rate rises this year from the Federal Reserve and most expect at least three more in 2018, a Reuters poll showed Wednesday after the U.S. central bank lifted rates for the second time in three months.
   TDThese so-called primary dealers, or banks that do business directly with the Fed, were divided, however, on when they expect the Fed to outline its plans for trimming back its $4.4 trillion bond portfolio.

Half the respondents see that happening by the end of 2017, and the other half expect the Fed to wait until 2018 or later to detail its balance sheet resolution plan.

Responding to steady economic growth, strong job gains and confidence that inflation is rising its target, the Fed on Wednesday raised its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent, as was widely expected.

Following that announcement, 16 of the 18 primary dealers that responded to the poll said they expect the federal funds rate to rise to between 1.25 percent and 1.50 percent by the end of 2017. Two saw the rate reaching to 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent, which would indicate three more hikes.

Looking into 2018, 13 of 16 dealers offering a forecast said the Fed would hike at least three times next year, with a median year-end forecast of between 2.0 percent and 2.25 percent. Eight predicted three hikes and five said the Fed would accelerate its pace to four increases in 2018. Just three dealers saw the Fed decelerating to two increases.

The results were largely in step with a poll of the same group of banks after last Friday's stronger-than-expected report on the U.S. employment situation.

It did mark a notable change from a poll one month ago when most dealers still expected just two rate hikes this year, with none of them then forecasting a move at the Fed's March meeting.

A series of public comments from Fed officials in the weeks before the latest meeting swiftly altered that perception and by the time policy makers had gathered in Washington this week, a rate hike had been fully priced into financial markets.

On the Fed's next move, 12 of the 18 dealers in the survey said the bank would lift rates by another quarter point by the end of the second quarter to between 1.0 percent and 1.25 percent, while six see the Fed holding off until the third quarter.

On the issue of when the Fed would announce how it would begin winding down the portfolio of bonds it acquired through three phases of its so-called quantitative easing program, eight of 16 dealers answering the question said it would occur this year. Another seven said the Fed would announce that in 2018 and one said that would not take place until 2019.

Asked what they saw as the main near-term risk to the economic outlook, six each cited President Donald Trump's evolving policies on trade and on taxes and spending as the main threat, while two pointed to the strength in the U.S. dollar.

 CLMHeard on the Street   SEMarkets   HDFed and Investors Are a Happy Couple, for Now; Markets and the central bank agree on three rate increases this year, but stocks are pricing in stronger growth than the  Federal Reserve  expects   BYBy Justin Lahart    WC328 words   PD15 March 2017   ET20:46   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPThe Federal Reserve and investors are in broad agreement over where interest rates are heading. Their views on the economy are another matter.

The Fed's rate-setting committee on Wednesday raised its target range on overnight rates by one-quarter of a percentage point, and released projections indicating the central bank will raise rates twice more this year. For investors worried that the Fed might raise rates more aggressively, this counted as good news. Interest-rate futures show investors' rate expectations match the Fed's.
   TDFurthermore, a tweak to the Fed's description of its inflation goal in its policy statement suggested a willingness to let inflation temporarily rise above its 2% target. With the risk of the Fed slamming the brakes on the economy seemingly lower, investors sent stocks up and Treasury yields down.

While the central bank and investors agree on rates, they differ on the economic forecast. The bank's median projection for growth this year was basically unchanged from December, with fourth-quarter gross domestic product up 2.1%, inflation at 2% under the Fed's preferred measure and unemployment down to 4.5%.

Stock-market investors, judging by this year's rally, see the economy growing more rapidly than the Fed does, which could push up growth and inflation and push down unemployment more than the central bank believes.

If investors are right, the Fed will need to choose between an uncomfortable increase in inflation and raising rates further. If investors are wrong, they have pushed the stock market too high. Either way, the friendly relationship between the Fed and investors might not last.

 HDFed to keep rate hikes slow even if U.S. inflation overshoots -Yellen   WC493 words   PD15 March 2017   ET22:42   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. 
   LPMarch 15 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will stick to a gradual path of interest rate rises even if inflation runs above its 2 percent target, Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, signaling that the U.S. central bank is willing to use low rates to push down even harder on unemployment.

Yellen's comments were the one major surprise in the Fed's decision on Wednesday to hike rates by 25 basis points and likely lift them two more times this year even as the labor market improves and inflation firms.
   TDThe comments also signaled that the central bank was confident it could rein in inflation, if needed, and that it has the credibility to do so in the event of a sustained spike.

"It’s a reminder 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation, it’s a target," Yellen told a news conference after the rate decision was released. "There will be some times when inflation is above 2 percent, just like it's been below 2 percent."

Inflation has ticked up globally after years of negative and near-negative rates and massive injections of central bank money into the financial system in a bid to head off deflationary forces.

U.S. headline inflation is about 2 percent already, and core inflation - seen as a better measure of underlying inflation trends because it strips out volatile food and fuel prices -- is expected to reach 2 percent next year.

"They want to make sure they don’t short-circuit the recovery," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. "They are buying themselves some leeway in the future to let inflation tick higher and still not raise rates faster."

Yellen's term as Fed chair has been marked by a cautious approach to raising interest rates, and her comments on Wednesday and in the Fed's policy statement suggest that the central bank is keen to avert a tightening of financial markets if data in coming months shows inflation above the bank's target.

Four years ago, then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke triggered a bond selloff when he hinted at curtailing the central bank's bond-buying stimulus sooner than markets had expected. The "taper tantrum" ended up delaying the Fed's planned return to a more normal stance of monetary policy.

Yellen did not specify how much of an inflation overshoot the Fed would tolerate, though past policymaker comments suggest that 2.25 percent or 2.5 percent inflation would be acceptable to the central bank.

"If we had a little inflation, would that be so terrible?" said Alice Rivlin, a former Fed vice chair now at the Brookings Institution. "It's something the Fed knows very well how to handle."

 SEPro Bankruptcy   HDContinued  Interest Rate  Hikes Expected to Drive Restructuring Activity; Turnaround experts say ongoing  interest rate  increases will produce additional restructuring opportunities by the year's end.   BYBy Lillian Rizzo and Soma Biswas    WC424 words   PD15 March 2017   ET22:49   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

   LPTurnaround professionals expect to see increased restructuring activity due to the Federal Reserve's rate hike—just not in the near-term.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it would increase short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point, to 1% from 0.75%, and would raise rates twice more this year.
   TDThe immediate rate hike won't make much of a difference for distressed companies, restructuring professionals told WSJ Pro Bankruptcy Wednesday.

"Fundamentally, a quarter-point hike doesn't matter that much," said Gershon Distenfeld, AllianceBernstein LP's director of credit.

Rick Chesley, global co-chair of DLA Piper's restructuring practice, is looking ahead to the increases that will follow.

"The combination of the rates increase and traditional banks pulling back from lending in certain sectors will lead to more restructuring activity," said Mr. Chesley, pointing specifically to the commercial real estate, construction, industrials and manufacturing sectors. "Many of those companies that have historically just been getting by will see that comfort end soon."

Namely, those companies with hefty debt loads that are in need of a debt refinancing in the next 12 to 18 months will be added to distress watch lists, said Joseph D'Angelo, a partner with Carl Marks Advisors.

"We'll see the effects on companies that took on more debt than they should have and their growth projections aren't playing out as they though," he said. He also expects there to be distress across private-equity portfolio companies, namely the ones with higher leverage ratios.

As a result, experts said there should be more widespread distress across various industries, rather than being concentrated on certain sectors.

In recent years the bulk of restructuring activity has been sector-specific. Dozens of oil and gas companies fell victim to the steep decline in oil prices in 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile, retail, which has continued to be a distressed sector due to changing consumer habits and dwindling mall traffic, has seen numerous bankruptcy filings throughout 2016 and in the first three months of 2017.

"For turnaround guys like myself, the complaint has been that cheap money is masking operational issues at companies, and now those issues are more likely to be addressed," Mr. D'Angelo said.

 HDFed raises rate and sees more hikes as US economy improves   BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER    CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,160 words   PD15 March 2017   ET22:02   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2017.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. 
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time in three months and forecast two additional hikes this year. The move reflects a consistently solid U.S. economy and will likely mean higher rates on some consumer and business loans.

The Fed's key short-term rate is rising by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. The central bank said in a statement that a strengthening job market and rising prices had moved it closer to its targets for employment and inflation.
   TDThe message the Fed sent Wednesday is that nearly eight years after the Great Recession ended, the economy no longer needs the support of ultra-low borrowing rates and is healthy enough to withstand steadily tighter credit.

The decision, issued after the Fed's latest policy meeting, was approved 9-1. Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's regional bank in Minneapolis, was the dissenting vote. The statement said Kashkari preferred to leave rates unchanged.

The Fed's forecast for future hikes, drawn from the views of 17 officials, still projects that it will raise rates three times this year, unchanged from the previous forecast in December. But the number of Fed officials who think three rate hikes will be appropriate for 2017 rose from six to nine.

The central bank's outlook for the economy changed little, with officials expecting growth of 2.1 percent this year and next year before slipping to 1.9 percent in 2019. Those forecasts are far below the 4 percent growth that President Donald Trump has said he can produce with his economic program.

The Fed's rate hike should have little effect on mortgages or auto and student loans. The central bank doesn't directly affect those rates, at least not in the short run. But rates on some other loans — notably credit cards, home equity loans and adjustable-rate mortgages — will likely rise soon, though only modestly. Those rates are based on benchmarks like banks' prime rate, which moves in tandem with the Fed's key rate.

After the Fed's announcement, major banks began announcing that they were raising their prime lending rate from 3.75 percent to 4 percent.

Mark Vitner, an economist at Wells Fargo, noted that the Fed's statement provided little hint of the timing of the next rate hike. The lack of specificity gives the Fed flexibility in case forthcoming elections in Europe or other unseen events disrupt the global economy.

"They don't want to prematurely set the table for a rate hike," Vitner said. "I think they're confident, but it's hard not to be cautious after we've had so many shocks over the years."

Stock prices rose and bond yields fell as traders reacted to the Fed's plans to raise rates gradually. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been only modestly positive before the decision was announced at 2 p.m. Eastern time, closed up 112 points.

The Fed's statement made few changes from the last one issued Feb. 1. But it did note that inflation, after lagging at worrisomely low levels for years, has picked up and was moving near the Fed's 2 percent target.

And it adopted some new language hinting that it might be tolerant of higher-than-optimal inflation for some unspecified period. Economists said this suggested that officials could let inflation top their 2 percent target, just as inflation remained stuck below 2 percent for years after the Great Recession.

The new language "reflects the fact that inflation may run above 2 percent for some time," Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays, said in a note to clients.

Many economists think the next hike will occur no earlier than June, given that the Fed probably wants time to assess the likelihood that Congress will pass Trump's ambitious program of tax cuts, deregulation and increased spending on infrastructure.

In recent weeks, investors had seemed unfazed by the possibility that the Fed would raise rates several times in the coming months. Instead, Wall Street has been sustaining a stock market rally on the belief that the economy will remain durable and corporate profits strong.

A robust February jobs report — 235,000 added jobs, solid pay gains and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent — added to the perception that the economy is fundamentally sound.

That the Fed is no longer unsettling investors with the signal of forthcoming rate increases marks a sharp change from the anxiety that prevailed after 2008, when the central bank cut its key rate to a record low and kept it there for seven years. During those years, any slight shift in sentiment about when the Fed might begin raising rates — a step that would lead eventually to higher loan rates for consumers and businesses — was enough to move global markets.

The Fed has managed its control of interest rates with exceeding caution, beginning with an initial hike in December 2015. It then waited an entire year before raising rates again in December last year.

But now, the economy is widely considered sturdy enough to handle modestly higher loan rates. While the broadest gauge of the economy's health — the gross domestic product — remains below levels associated with a healthy economy, many analysts say they're optimistic that Trump's economic plans will accelerate growth. His proposals have managed to boost the confidence of business executives and offset concerns that investors might otherwise have about the effects of Fed rate increases.

Yet for the same reason, some caution that if Trump's program fails to survive Congress intact, concerns will arise that his plans won't deliver much economic punch. Investors may start to fret about how steadily higher Fed rates will raise the cost of borrowing and slow spending by consumers and businesses.

15 Mar 2017 15:41 ET  Fed's Yellen Says March Rate Rise Shouldn't Have Been A Surprise


By Michael S. Derby 

Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Wednesday financial markets shouldn't have been caught off guard by the interest rate rise the central bank just delivered.

Ms. Yellen was speaking at a press conference following a gathering of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. It delivered an increase in the central bank's overnight target rate range to 0.75% to 1.00% and signaled more rate rises are coming, although it offered few hints when that might happen.

Until fairly recently, financial markets had put decidedly low odds on the Fed acting at this gathering and had instead looked to the Fed's June policy meeting as the most likely time to boost rates, following on from December's increase in borrowing costs. But Fed officials, in what many viewed as an unexpectedly hawkish rhetorical surge, drove markets to price in the Fed's March rate rises with a slew of public comments starting with remarks from the San Francisco and New York Fed presidents on Feb. 28.

Ms. Yellen and her top lieutenant, Stanley Fischer built on those views in comments on March 3, with Mr. Fischer saying "if there has been a conscious effort" to boost expectations of a rate rise, "I'm about to join it."

"When I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to me to have been reasonably consistent over this entire period," Ms. Yellen said at the press conference. She said Fed meeting minutes and other communications all added up toward a push toward higher rates, so it became incumbent on officials to weigh in as the March meeting got closer.

"As we saw the data continued to come in in line with our expectations, my colleagues and I spoke out" that a rate rise was coming. Ms. Yellen acknowledged that markets may have underestimated the Fed's appetite to raise rates in part because officials had expected to boost borrowing costs four times in 2016 but only did it once as unexpected economic developments got in the way of acting, she said.

"it is important for the public to understand that we are getting closer to reaching our objectives" and because of that, Fed rate policy is going to be moving higher, Ms. Yellen said.

The Fed chair said "even after this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative, thus supporting some further strengthening in the job market, and a sustained return to 2% inflation."

Moving rates up now also reduced the risk of falling behind the curve, she said, explaining the rate rise Wednesday "reflects our view that waiting too long to scale back some accommodation could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly, sometime down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession," Ms. Yellen said.

 HD*Fitch: Fed Embarks on New Phase of Normalization   WC1,822 words   PD15 March 2017   ET21:39   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LP15 Mar 2017 16:39 ET  Press Release: Fitch: Fed Embarks on New Phase of Normalization


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings: 
 
   TDFitch Ratings-New York/London-15 March 2017: The US Federal Reserve's (the Fed) decision to hike interest rates by 25bps represents the beginning of a new phase of US monetary policy normalization, says Fitch Ratings.

The prediction for three hikes in 2017 in the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) December 2016 Summary of Economic Projections was initially met with some skepticism in financial markets. However, by moving rates up again so quickly, the Fed now looks well on track to deliver. Two rate hikes within the space of just over three months and some marginal toughening up of the statement on forward guidance underscore the contrast with the glacial and hesitant approach to unwinding stimulus seen in the past few years. More broadly, Fitch believes that the recent US rate hikes could mark the beginning of a significant shift in the global interest rate environment, with benchmark US policy rates settling higher over the long term than current market expectations.

The decision to raise the Fed Funds target rate to 0.75%-1.00% marks the second rate hike in just over three months. This represents a major acceleration in Fed action. Fitch now expects a total of seven hikes in 2017 and 2018, bringing the policy rate to 2.50%. This contrasts with just two rate hikes in total between the end of 2008 and 2016.

Macro indicators through 2H16 and early 2017 reinforce the likelihood of a pickup in rate normalization over the medium term. GDP growth of 2.6% (annualized) in 2H16 was a significant recovery from 1H16, underpinned by improvements in private investment and industrial output. So far, jobs data this year have also been supportive, with the latest nonfarm payrolls, unemployment and private sector earnings figures all pointing to tightening labor market conditions.

Material fiscal easing should bolster positive domestic demand trends. President Trump's agenda of tax cuts, fiscal stimulus and deregulation in the financial services and other sectors strongly indicates that some level of growth boost is likely. Although the precise form of stimulus remains uncertain, Fitch believes that fiscal policy could add up to 0.3pp to economic growth in both 2017 and 2018. Fitch recently revised up its US growth expectations in recognition of the increased likelihood of fiscal easing, higher private investment and improving global outlook. Fitch forecasts US GDP growth to accelerate to 2.3% and 2.6% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Fitch does not believe that the increased pace of Fed rate hikes poses a risk to US economic growth. However, the impact from dollar strengthening could have wider global effects, especially should this result in prolonged monetary policy divergence. US rate rises, combined with fiscal stimulus, at a time when the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are continuing to pursue ultra-loose monetary policy, should prolong the dollar strengthening trend. Rising rates and dollar strength have historically added to external financing risks for emerging markets.

Fitch believes that market expectations for a permanently lower equilibrium interest rate in the US and the continuation of ultra-loose monetary policy for several more years could be increasingly challenged. This could result in a rapid shift in consensus expectations toward a higher terminal rate and a faster pace of normalization. Notably, market consensus was not expecting a March rate hike as early as last month, although healthy macro data releases and hawkish public statements from FOMC members resulted in a quick shift in expectations ahead of the actual decision.

   LP15:44 borrowing increase in the US, according to Eric Donovan, managing director at INTL FCStone. One reason is that it signals the Fed sees the economic situation in the US and around the world as returning to normal. Another is that it will provide the Fed with room to react with rate cuts in the event of a crisis in the future, Donovan said. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)
   TD15:41 ET - By the summer, the Air Force expects to seek bids from both SpaceX and United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, for big-ticket military satellite launches slated to kick off early in the next decade. SpaceX is expected to submit its Falcon Heavy booster, and United Launch is pushing to have its newly-designed Vulcan rocket available. Both rockets are taking longer to develop than initially anticipated. So the Air Force has extended through at least the end of 2019 -- two years longer than previously projected -- current contracting arrangement pitting the two rivals against each other using existing rocket designs. A senior Air Force official cites delays in Vulcan development as a big reason for that policy decision. (andy.pasztor@wsj.com)

15:38 ET - Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen calls the central bank's regulatory calendar "relatively light at this point," in a press conference following an interest rate increase and policy statement. She says the Fed doesn't have a lot of time-sensitive regulations on its docket at present and "there is nothing right now that we need to get out that is a significant rule." Many rules are on hold with the new administration, but her comments could still come as a surprise to those waiting for the specifics of the Fed's large counterparty exposure rule, which the central bank is expected to be finalizing soon. The Fed has been silent on its status, having already taken a series of industry comments since proposing it last March. (Katy.Burne@wsj.com)

15:33 ET - Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that she would look at any proposals put forward by the Trump administration related to a "21st Century Glass-Steagall Act," but since the administration has not put forward any such proposal, she did not see anything "concrete to react to." She did say that postcrisis financial regulations had helped to ensure that the shadow banking system was "appropriately capitalized," and their "management was strengthened." She noted that a lack of a separation between investment and commercial banking at bank holding companies had not been a primary cause of the financial crisis. (gabriel.rubin@wsj.com; @rubinations)

15:28 ET - Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen says the Fed does not currently have any "time-sensitive" regulations that "need to get out." In response to a question about whether the Fed would abide by the requests of some congressional Republicans to refrain from issuing new rules, Yellen says that the Fed has "an obligation to write the rules that Congress dictates in laws that they pass." (gabriel.rubin@wsj.com)

15:25 ET - This Fed rate increase was fully expected, and embedded in the market's price, says Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's speech wasn't surprising, and the Fed continues to move gradually, he says. "I think the market got what it wanted, both for equities and fixed income," Mortimer says. "There's a bit of a rally on the longer end of the curve, which maybe had been pricing in a bit more hawkishness." BNY Mellon Wealth Management is underweight bonds and overweight stocks, and believes it's "well-positioned for the months and quarters ahead," he says. It doesn't believe stock valuations are at extreme levels, but expects modest returns from stocks this year, he adds. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

15:22 ET - The Fed's message to consumers as it raises rates by a quarter percentage point: the economy is performing well and is becoming more resilient to shocks than it was in the 2008 meltdown. "The simple message is the economy is doing well," she said in a press conference, in response to a question about what the Fed wants to communicate to consumers. Unemployment "has moved way down," and although labor market conditions are not ideal "for every individual in the United States...many Americas are enjoying a stronger labor market and feel better," she added. Inflation is moving up and "people can feel good about the economic outlook." (katy.burne@wsj.com)

15:21 ET - "The Fed's decision to raise interest rates today is in line with Vanguard's perspective of the state of the US economy," said Roger Aliaga-Diaz, chief economist, Americas, at Vanguard Group. "We're pleased that the Fed is moving toward normalization, as the balance of risk has clearly shifted." Additional rate hikes are warranted this year, given the labor market's strength and upward inflation trends, he adds. "We agree with the Fed's signaling to allow inflation to run hot in order to achieve a sustained 2% target - yet anticipate another hike in June," he says. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

15:19 ET - While it was Fed officials that were very clearly the engine that drove markets to expect a March rate rise, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen says there was no great change in views among central bankers. "When I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to me to have been reasonably consistent over this entire period," Yellen said. She said Fed meeting minutes and other communications all added up toward a push toward higher rates, so it became incumbent on officials to speak out. As we saw the data continued to come in line with our expectations, my colleagues and I spoke out" that a rate rise was coming. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

15:15 ET - After weeks of central bank officials making the case for raising rates, some investors like John Augustine, chief investment officer of Huntington Bank, were worried the Fed may be more hawkish in its statement Wednesday. Most worrisome: That the Fed could signal it will raise rates four times in 2017 compared to three. "We were concerned they would pivot to a hawkish stance, the dollar would rise, and we might have to consider taking more client money overseas to find growth opportunities," he said. "We're not seeing that scenario with today's action." Instead, the Fed indicated it will raise rates three times this year. The dollar fell, government bonds strengthened and stocks extended gains. "Today is good news," said Augustine, adding that "We'll keep our money here in the States for now." (corrie.driebusch@wsj.com)

15:17 ET - Caterpillar (CAT) and the United Auto Workers have reached a tentative agreement that covers six years. Details weren't immediately available, but the labor deal struck today averts a strike or other action that could slow production for the Peoria, Ill.-based heavy-machinery giant. CAT has about 5,000 UAW-represented employees. The company said the agreement "successfully balances the needs of an increasingly competitive global marketplace and recognizes the contribution of our employees by providing fair, competitive wages and benefits." Members of the union must still approve the deal. A vote is set for March 26. (andrew.tangel@wsj.com; @AndrewTangel)

15:14 ET - The dollar has tumbled 1.1% against a basket of major currencies after the Fed's interest-rate decision, an outsize move for the index. Peter Ng, a foreign exchange trader at Silicon Valley Bank, says this sharp selloff is being fueled in part by "overextended" positioning in the dollar. Investors spent the first two months of the year unwinding bets on a stronger dollar. But optimistic speeches from Fed officials prompted hedge funds and others to rebuild some of those positions heading into the Fed meeting. The net long position in the dollar as of March 7 stood at about $16B, according to CFTC data. Ng said the skewed positioning left the market vulnerable to a quick reversal.

15:11 ET - Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen says in a press conference that the central bank is closely watching financial conditions in assessing the economy's outlook. The Fed noticed, for example, "in the last several months, that risk spreads, particularly for lower grade corporate issuers, have narrowed," she said, referring to junk-rated borrowers benefiting from a rush of investor appetite in their debt. Chair Yellen said those narrowing risk levels are "another signal that financial conditions have become somewhat easier," lending weight to the Fed's decision to raise rates. (katy.burne@wsj.com)

15:04 ET - US Federal Reserve managed to hike rates with little fanfare in March, having prepared markets for this in a series of speeches in late February, says Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International. This does not reflect a significant re-assessment of economic conditions, she says. "The Fed game-plan for now appears to be opportunistic hikes when external and market conditions are benign, gradually bringing the policy rate back to neutral," Stupnytska says, adding that her base case is only one more hike this year. "This is because we are likely reaching a cyclical peak soon, and the likelihood of a China slowdown weighing on global inflation, markets and growth is fairly high."

15:00 ET - Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen says she had a brief meeting with President Trump, though she didn't offer any details about what they discussed. Speaking at a press conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting, Yellen said she had met a couple of times with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and was introduced to President Trump. "I had a very brief meeting and appreciated that as well," she said of her interaction with Trump. Yellen said she and Mnuchin had "very good discussions" about the economy, regulatory objectives, the work of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and global economic developments.

14:59 ET - While the Fed did hike rates and the dot plot for Fed funds were upgraded a bit, "it does not meet our threshold for a hawkish hike," say Brown Brothers Harriman analysts. After seeing the statement and dots, the market concluded that there was a somewhat less of a chance for a June hike, BBH analysts add. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)

14:56 ET - Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has spent the past few months batting down questions about the Trump administration's fiscal policy and how the Fed would respond. In a press conference following the Fed's meeting, Yellen said officials had not talked about how the central bank would react to potential changes. "There's nothing that's a speculation about preemptive responses to future policy moves," she says. "We have plenty of time to see what happens." Yellen also reiterated that fiscal policy remains uncertain. (david.harrison@wsj.com)

14:53 ET - In the wake of the Fed announcement, market odds on a May rate rise are very low according to data from the CME Group's fed funds futures market. Markets are split over a June rate rise, slightly favoring no action. Put another way, the dovish bent of the Fed statement just doesn't provide much guidance on the Fed's appetite for future rate rises, although Chairwoman Janet Yellen's press conference could clearly change this outlook. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

18:52 GMT - Today's move by the FOMC to hike the federal funds rate makes good on recent comments from Janet Yellen and her colleagues that the next policy move would come sooner rather than later, says Thanos Bardas, head of interest rates at Neuberger Berman. Only a few weeks ago, Fed funds futures reflected about a 25% chance of an increase in March but by this past Monday, this figure had surged to more than 90%, "making the actual event a virtual afterthought," Bardas says.

   LPKuwait on Wednesday raised its benchmark discount rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent after the US Federal Reserve hiked its rate, the central bank said.

Central bank governor Mohammad al-Hashel said in a statement the increase was taken "to ensure the continued competitiveness," of the Kuwaiti dinar in light of interest rate movements on major currencies.
   TDThe hike will be effective from Thursday, the statement said.

The Fed on Wednesday raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point citing higher inflation.

The Kuwaiti decision was taken although the emirate is the only member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) not to peg its currency to the US dollar.

Instead the dinar is linked to a basket of major currencies, the composition of which is kept confidential. But it is believed that the greenback accounts for more than 70 percent of its weight.

Under central bank regulations, interest rates on consumer loans cannot exceed three percentage points above the discount rate.

14:29 ET - An important question for Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen to answer at today's press conference is, given that economic outlook hasn't changed much and as uncertainty surrounds the forecast, why raise rates now? Some would say the hike today was tactical. The economy's in a good enough spot to justify higher rates now and the rest of the year is pretty up in the air given the tumult in Washington. Raise rates today and the Fed has more flexibility to act later in the year, and potentially avoid a replay of 2016, when officials signaled four increases for the year and only delivered one. A second year of dashed expectations could create a real credibility problem. By moving rates up now, the Fed has more breathing room as the year moves forward, the argument goes.

14:27 ET - ICE Dollar Index hit a low of 100.87 after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates but left its economic forecast virtually unchanged, disappointing some market participants. "Some investors may have expected a slightly more hawkish tone to the Fed's language given the tone of some of the recent commentary from the Fed," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. Higher rates make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors. (ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com)

14:27 ET - The Fed may have raised rates today, but it's policy statement doesn't suggest much urgency to boost the cost of borrowing any time soon. Prattle, a company that uses computers to grade Fed communications for hawkish and dovish leanings, says of the Fed policy statement: "The FOMC Statement today scored neutral, signaling that the Fed's recent hawkish rhetoric was intended to set the stage for this rate hike, but does not represent a sustained shift toward a more hawkish Fed." (michael.derby@wsj.com)

14:25 ET - The dollar hit its lowest level against the Mexican peso since early November and sold off against other emerging markets as well, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points but offered few major changes in their economic outlook. Emerging market investors had feared a faster pace of rate increases, as higher rates in the US diminish the attractiveness of higher yielding but comparatively risky emerging economies. The dollar was recently down 1.6% against the Mexican peso to 19.33, while also falling sharply against the South African rand, Brazilian real and Russian ruble. (ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com)

14:23 ET - Government bonds and their stock-market proxies are climbing following the Fed's rate hike decision. Shares of utilities companies, often considered bond proxies because they typically pay high dividends, are up 1.6%. The group was up 0.5% before the decision. Shares of real estate companies, also often considered bond proxies, are up 1.4% versus up 0.6% before the decision. Government bonds edge higher, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.53% versus 2.57% before the Fed decision. (akane.otani@wsj.com)

14:21 ET - Stocks climbed after the Fed said, as expected, it would raise short-term interest rates and signaled it still expects to raise rates three times this year. "The Fed has pretty well telegraphed ahead of time they'd be pushing for a rate rise here, acknowledging the labor market has been quite strong and inflation has been ticking up to their goal," said Tony Bedikian, head of global markets for Citizens Bank. "It's a bit of a dovish hike," he added, something that should continue to buttress major stock indexes, which have been on a tear in recent months, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each hitting more than a dozen fresh closing records in 2017. "This message for gradual tightening has been equity friendly," Bedikian added. In recent trading the Dow industrials are up 0.4%, vs. up 0.2% prior to the decision announcement.

14:19 ET - Not everyone's feeling the love with today's interest rate rise. While inflation worriers may feel the central bank is taking more seriously its inflation control mandate, the left leaning activists of the Fed Up Coalition are calling out the central bank for making what they see as a huge blunder. Shawn Sebastian, the group's co-director, says "the data simply does not support a rate hike right now. Wage growth is still too slow, and millions of people who want to work full-time cannot." He goes on to say that the Fed is boosting rates based primarily on confidence data as opposed to evidence of real-world wage rises. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

14:16 ET - As part of its decision to raise rates, the Fed has instructed the New York Fed on some technical issues to keep rates at desired levels. As of today, the NY Fed is instructed to boost the interest rate paid on excess reserves to 1%, and the reverse repo borrowing rate to 0.75%. This is part of the corridor system of interest rate control practiced by the Fed right now, with the traditional target of the fed funds rate floating somewhere in between those levels. The New York Fed is also ordered to carry on with buying securities to keep the Fed's $4.5T balance sheet steady. Many expect the Fed to stop or taper the so-called reinvestment process later this year. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

   LP14:45 ET - Last week's upbeat US jobs report was the green light the Fed needed for its eagerly anticipated rate rise, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. With the economy approaching full employment and indicators looking more robust, the Fed felt confident continuing on the path to normalization, Curtin says, adding that at current activity levels, the economy should be well able to tolerate moderately higher interest rates. (emese.bartha@wsj.com; @EmeseBartha)
   TD14:42 ET - It clearly could have been worse for the bond market. Treasury yields have declined after the Fed's interest-rate decision, reflecting relief that the Fed still expects to raise rates three times this year even as starts down that path this month. "The market had already priced this in and was probably starting to price a more hawkish statement than we got," said Andrew Johnson, head of global investment grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman. The 10-year Treasury yield was recently 2.533% vs. 2.571% just before the Fed's decision and 2.595% Tuesday. (sam.goldfarb@wsj.com)

14:42 ET - The Air Force, which previously indicated it wasn't likely to contract for SpaceX rockets powered by used engines, now has made that decision formal. Claire Leon, the service's top rocket-acquisition official, says current requests for bids on satellite launches specifically bar boosters that include main engines and a lower stage refurbished after a prior trip to space. SpaceX officials have touted such reusable rockets as the key to lower costs and accelerated launch tempos. But according to the senior civilian Air Force official, if the concept works out for commercial launches over the years then "we might consider it for the future." (andy.pasztor@wsj.com)

14:39 ET - To comply with government ethics rules, Donald Trump's cabinet and White House appointees must sell more than $1B in assets, much of which are relatively hard-to-sell holdings such as stakes in private-equity funds. Luckily for fund-stake sellers, such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, there's never been a better time to sell second-hand private-equity investments. Once an arcane bargain bin, the market for so-called secondaries has become a hot corner for Wall Street. Investment bank Greenhill (GHL) estimates there is more than $100B of uninvested cash in secondaries funds. DeVos's for-sale fund stakes, which ethics filings show are worth at least $175M, is right around the average size of secondaries deals last year, according to Greenhill. "There are 100 firms that could purchase this portfolio," says Greenhill's Stephen Sloan, who says the investments should attract wide interest when they are shopped.

14:37 ET - CBS has signed a new distribution deal to keep its content on Verizon FiOS (VZ).

14:35 ET - Year-end results released this week from publicly-traded Burford Capital (BUR.LN) show that the appetite for using outside money to finance legal matters continues to grow. Burford said it had $115.1M in profits after tax in 2016, a more than 76% increase from the prior year. The firm made $378M in new litigation investments, up from $206M in 2015. Burford in December bought rival Gerchen Keller Capital for $160M. Burford now makes most of its investments in portfolios of lawsuits, a shift from the industry's origins. Single lawsuits only made up 12% of its new investments last year. The firm is beginning to sell portions of its investments on the secondary market, potentially opening up the funding of legal matters to new investors. (sara.randazzo@wsj.com; @sara_randazzo)

14:35 ET - The rate increase announced by the Fed was fully expected, but doesn't necessarily signal a campaign of further hikes through 2017, says Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Boston advisory firm Fiduciary Trust Company. The Fed will continue to be data dependent, "modeling the impact of future US economic data, but also what's going on in Europe--Brexit progress, and the elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany," Andersen says. Those elections are traditionally outside the Fed's immediate focus, but surprises in Europe could impact the U.S. economy, he says. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

14:29 ET - One reason stocks are higher post-Fed decision? Investors got exactly what they expected: an increase in short-term interest rates and confirmation the Fed plans to hike three times this year. The Fed gave "the market what it wants and more importantly what it expected," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "The statement described a solid economy along with inflation moving in the right direction and ... full employment." S&P 500 up 0.7% versus up 0.4% before the Fed decision. (akane.otani@wsj.com)

14:20 ET - In a change of pace, US officials are heaping praise on Yahoo (YHOO). Today, officials announced charges against four men who hacked YHOO computer systems and stole personal data from 500M accounts in 2014. The Justice Department commended YHOO--as well as Alphabet Google (GOOGL)--for their "sustained and invaluable cooperation in the investigation." The FBI held YHOO up as an example of "early, proactive engagement and cooperation." This is a far better review than the one from YHOO's board, which earlier this month said YHOO execs failed to "properly comprehend or investigate," the 2014 breach when it happened.

14:11 ET - Pacific Alliance, a group of four pro-trade Latin American countries, announced this week they are looking to deepen commerce with other nations by creating associated members, leading to free trade deals. And the first country that could sign a deal with the group could be New Zealand, officials say. "We think the time is right for New Zealand and the Pacific Alliance to do a trade deal," said New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay. "We are complimentary economies... New Zealand is very much a stepping stone now to Southeast Asia." The Pacific Alliance includes Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru. Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo agreed that New Zealand would be a good first choice for signing a trade deal with the group. (ryan.dube@wsj.com; @duberyan)

The FOMC expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the fed-funds rate, it said. That's slightly different language from the previous statement, which expected "only gradual increases." (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry)

14:05 ET - Federal Reserve is growing more confident in the return of 2% inflation, according to the statement following its two-day meeting. Officials believe inflation "will stabilize around 2% over the medium term," the statement said. They also said monetary policy would manage to deliver "a sustained return to 2% inflation." The statement also reiterated that the Fed views its inflation target as "symmetric," a sign officials would tolerate inflation moving slightly above 2% for a little while. Inflation rose 1.9% in January from the previous year according to the Fed's preferred metric. (david.harrison@wsj.com)

14:04 ET - As widely expected, Fed officials voted to raise their benchmark federal-funds rate a quarter percentage point to a range between 0.75% and 1.00%. Not everyone on the Fed's rate-setting committee was on board: Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who just joined the committee at the start of the year, voted against the action. Kashkari said he preferred to hold rates steady for now, underscoring his recent remarks that he was in no rush to move at the moment. (kate.davidson@wsj.com)

14:03 ET - Fed officials still forecast they will have increased the benchmark federal-funds rate a total of three times in quarter-percentage-point increments by the end of this year, and that's including the increase enacted at its March meeting, according to their latest projections. The median of officials' forecasts implies rates will rise to 1.375% by the end of 2017, 2.125% by the end of 2018, and 3.000% by the end of 2019. That implies three quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2017 and 2018, the same pace as officials projected in December. For 2019, officials see three to four increases, which is a slightly higher projection than in December. (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry)

   LP14:25 ET - The dollar hit its lowest level against the Mexican peso since early November and sold off against other emerging markets as well, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points but offered few major changes in their economic outlook. Emerging market investors had feared a faster pace of rate increases, as higher rates in the US diminish the attractiveness of higher yielding but comparatively risky emerging economies. The dollar was recently down 1.6% against the Mexican peso to 19.33, while also falling sharply against the South African rand, Brazilian real and Russian ruble. (ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com)
   TD14:23 ET - Government bonds and their stock-market proxies are climbing following the Fed's rate hike decision. Shares of utilities companies, often considered bond proxies because they typically pay high dividends, are up 1.6%. The group was up 0.5% before the decision. Shares of real estate companies, also often considered bond proxies, are up 1.4% versus up 0.6% before the decision. Government bonds edge higher, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.53% versus 2.57% before the Fed decision. (akane.otani@wsj.com)

14:21 ET - Stocks climbed after the Fed said, as expected, it would raise short-term interest rates and signaled it still expects to raise rates three times this year. "The Fed has pretty well telegraphed ahead of time they'd be pushing for a rate rise here, acknowledging the labor market has been quite strong and inflation has been ticking up to their goal," said Tony Bedikian, head of global markets for Citizens Bank. "It's a bit of a dovish hike," he added, something that should continue to buttress major stock indexes, which have been on a tear in recent months, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each hitting more than a dozen fresh closing records in 2017. "This message for gradual tightening has been equity friendly," Bedikian added. In recent trading the Dow industrials are up 0.4%, vs. up 0.2% prior to the decision announcement.

14:20 ET - In a change of pace, US officials are heaping praise on Yahoo (YHOO). Today, officials announced charges against four men who hacked YHOO computer systems and stole personal data from 500M accounts in 2014. The Justice Department commended YHOO--as well as Alphabet Google (GOOGL)--for their "sustained and invaluable cooperation in the investigation." The FBI held YHOO up as an example of "early, proactive engagement and cooperation." This is a far better review than the one from YHOO's board, which earlier this month said YHOO execs failed to "properly comprehend or investigate," the 2014 breach when it happened.

14:19 ET - Not everyone's feeling the love with today's interest rate rise. While inflation worriers may feel the central bank is taking more seriously its inflation control mandate, the left leaning activists of the Fed Up Coalition are calling out the central bank for making what they see as a huge blunder. Shawn Sebastian, the group's co-director, says "the data simply does not support a rate hike right now. Wage growth is still too slow, and millions of people who want to work full-time cannot." He goes on to say that the Fed is boosting rates based primarily on confidence data as opposed to evidence of real-world wage rises. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

14:16 ET - Figures from the US Energy Information Administration show American crude oil inventories declined by 0.24 million barrels due to lower crude imports from countries including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, says Standard Chartered bank. "The import fall was severe enough to bring crude inventories down in absolute terms despite low refinery runs of 15.47 million barrels per day," note Standard Chartered analysts. (neanda.salvaterra@wsj.com)

14:16 ET - As part of its decision to raise rates, the Fed has instructed the New York Fed on some technical issues to keep rates at desired levels. As of today, the NY Fed is instructed to boost the interest rate paid on excess reserves to 1%, and the reverse repo borrowing rate to 0.75%. This is part of the corridor system of interest rate control practiced by the Fed right now, with the traditional target of the fed funds rate floating somewhere in between those levels. The New York Fed is also ordered to carry on with buying securities to keep the Fed's $4.5T balance sheet steady. Many expect the Fed to stop or taper the so-called reinvestment process later this year. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

14:11 ET - Pacific Alliance, a group of four pro-trade Latin American countries, announced this week they are looking to deepen commerce with other nations by creating associated members, leading to free trade deals. And the first country that could sign a deal with the group could be New Zealand, officials say. "We think the time is right for New Zealand and the Pacific Alliance to do a trade deal," said New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay. "We are complimentary economies... New Zealand is very much a stepping stone now to Southeast Asia." The Pacific Alliance includes Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru. Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo agreed that New Zealand would be a good first choice for signing a trade deal with the group. (ryan.dube@wsj.com; @duberyan)

14:08 ET - The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its March meeting to a range of 0.75% to 1%, as widely expected. Ahead of the meeting, fed-funds futures showed the odds of a rate increase at the March meeting at 95.2%, according to CME Group. The FOMC expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the fed-funds rate, it said. That's slightly different language from the previous statement, which expected "only gradual increases." (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry)

14:08 ET - US stocks extend gains after the Fed raises interest rates and indicated it remained on track to keep tightening. The central bank said it still expects to raise short-term interest rates three times this year, and that it sees no major changes in its economic outlook. S&P 500 up 0.7% versus up 0.4% before the decision, Nasdaq Composite up 0.8% versus up 0.3% before and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.4% versus up 0.2% before. (akane.otani@wsj.com)

14:05 ET - Federal Reserve is growing more confident in the return of 2% inflation, according to the statement following its two-day meeting. Officials believe inflation "will stabilize around 2% over the medium term," the statement said. They also said monetary policy would manage to deliver "a sustained return to 2% inflation." The statement also reiterated that the Fed views its inflation target as "symmetric," a sign officials would tolerate inflation moving slightly above 2% for a little while. Inflation rose 1.9% in January from the previous year according to the Fed's preferred metric. (david.harrison@wsj.com)

14:04 ET - As widely expected, Fed officials voted to raise their benchmark federal-funds rate a quarter percentage point to a range between 0.75% and 1.00%. Not everyone on the Fed's rate-setting committee was on board: Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who just joined the committee at the start of the year, voted against the action. Kashkari said he preferred to hold rates steady for now, underscoring his recent remarks that he was in no rush to move at the moment. (kate.davidson@wsj.com)

   LP13:23 ET - Given the near certainty of today's Federal Reserve rate hike, it's worth a look back at how central bankers clearly led the market to this conclusion. Feb 28 was effectively the turning point. After several Fed officials indicated a March move was on the table, the leaders of the San Francisco and New York Fed banks, in separate appearances, offered up such strong guidance about a March rate rise that market odds of action moved up significantly. It was then up to officials like Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer to drive it home, as they did on March 3. Then, Fischer puckishly remarked "If there has been a conscious effort" to boost expectations of a rate rise, "I'm about to join it." (michael.derby@wsj.com)
   TD1721 GMT - A deterioration of recent economic data suggest it is "exceptionally unlikely" that the Bank of England will raise interest rates any time soon, according to Mike Riddell, UK Fixed Income Portfolio Manager at AllianzGI. He points to flat business investment, weakening business surveys and purchasing managers' indexes as well as rising consumer price inflation as reasons to expect sterling to remain under pressure. (riva.gold@wsj.com)

13:20 ET - While there are no names attached to the forecasts that comprise the Fed's "dot plot" of interest rate rises, there's a personal issue that might haunt the chart. When the now retired Atlanta Fed chief Dennis Lockhart offered up his outlook in December, he favored two rises versus the three hikes that made up the median view. This time around, bank staff will submit the view. Lockhart acknowledged on his way out last month that three increases were a possibility, so it's possible his staff could go that way, or even further. There's precedent for staff to be a bit bold: When Minneapolis Fed leader Narayana Kocherlakota quit in 2015, his staff presumably took back the negative rate call the super-dove was widely assumed to have contributed to the outlook.

13:12 ET - With shares up 88% over the 12 months, it's no surprise that Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan struck a more upbeat tone in his letter to shareholders released in the banks 2016 annual report. He says that the firm's 2016 profit was its second-largest in the bank's history after 2006 and says the bank is focused on the company's dividend as well as share buybacks.

13:05 ET - US stocks edged higher ahead of what nearly all economists and investors expect will be the Fed's first interest rate increase in 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 71 points, or 0.3% in recent trading. Bonds were mixed. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes declined to 2.571% from 2.595% on Tuesday as buyers stepped in, according to Tradeweb. The yield on 2-year Treasury, which tends to be more sensitive to changes to short-term rates, edged up to 1.389% from 1.380% a day ago. The WSJ Dollar Index, measuring the greenback against 16 others, fell 0.3%. (chris.dieterich@wsj.com)

12:58 ET - Shares of MSCI are up 1.3% after the financial index provider denied a report that it had rebuffed a takeover bid from S&P Global. MSCI surged more than 12% when markets opened, following an anonymously-sourced report in London's Evening Standard that S&P Global had unsuccessfully sought to buy the company for $120 per share, a deal that would have valued MSCI at about $11B. "We are not in discussions with any third party, and we have not received any offer or indication of interest," MSCI says. Shares of S&P Global are down 1.5% amid the deal chatter. The New York-based financial information and analytics giant has deepened its involvement in the index space in recent years, diversifying away from its core business of issuing debt ratings.

12:47 ET - From ice cream to cake icing, vanilla is the most commonly produced flavoring in the world. In its natural form, cultivated from orchids, it also is among the most expensive, while synthetic substitutes generate considerable wastewater. In new research today, chemists in India say they can make vanillin, the primary flavor compound in vanilla, which is cheaper and less polluting. In the key step, they create a catalyst by encapsulating copper-aluminum hydrotalcite in silica. The catalyst eliminates the need for a polluting step involving hydrochloric acid and, unlike catalysts currently used in commercial production, it can be recovered and recycled. The researchers say that their process could be economically scaled up. (lee.hotz@wsj.com; @leHotz)

12:38 ET - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Nationstar Mortgage LLC to pay a $1.75M civil penalty for alleged violation of a mortgage disclosure rule. The watchdog agency accused the mortgage lender for "consistently failing to report accurate data about mortgage transactions" from 2012 through 2014. The action represents the largest civil penalty imposed by the CFPB for the violation of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA, which requires lenders to disclose certain mortgage data to the public. Nationstar press representatives could not be reached immediately for comment. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com; @TokyoWoods)

12:32 ET - For all the hand-wringing on Wall Street -- and there is plenty -- the average banker took home a slightly bigger bonus in 2016 than they did in 2015. That's from the New York State Comptroller's office, which today released its annual bonus data for securities-industry workers in the state. The total bonus pool was $23.9B, up 2% from a year earlier, while the average bonus check rose 1% to $138,210. That follows two years of declines. And just for some perspective: the average bonus is up more than 800% since 1987. In that time, the minimum wage is up 116%, according to the Institute for Policy Studies. Beats flipping burgers.

Soyoil stocks, however, rose above expectations to 1.770B pounds, up from 1.655B the previous month. CBOT May soybean futures up 0.1% to $10.00 1/4 a bushel. (benjamin.parkin@wsj.com; @b_parkyn)

12:25 ET - A Washington auto-industry lobbying group lauds the Trump administration decision to reinstate a review of future emissions and fuel-economy regulations. "By restarting this review, analysis rather than politics will produce a final decision consistent with the process we all agreed to," said Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, group representing a dozen auto makers including GM, Ford (F) and Toyota (TM). He referred to rules set in 2012 requiring review of tailpipe-emissions standards calling for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon, or 40 mpg in real-world driving, by 2025. The Obama administration closed the review, which was not expected to be done until April 2018, a week before Trump took office. (mike.spector@wsj.com; @MikeSpectorWSJ).

12:19 ET - The Obama administration's decision to close a review of tougher vehicle emissions and fuel-economy standards 18 months before expected "slammed the door on the fingers of the auto industry," said Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation (AN), on CNBC. The Trump administration today is expected to trumpet a reversal of that move, reopening so-called midterm evaluation that wasn't expected to be done until April 2018. The EPA instead made a final determination a week before Trump's inauguration. Jackson said gasoline prices remaining below $3 a gallon boosts sales of pickup trucks and SUVs to more than 60% of US sales. Auto makers contend that makes the target of 54.5 miles a gallon, or 40 mpg in real-world driving, by 2025 unattainable. (mike.spector@wsj.com; @MikeSpectorWSJ).

    * U.S. 2-year yield hits highest since June 2009
    * Fed expected to raise rates at end of meeting
    * Longer-dated yields fall in curve flattener trade

    By Sam Forgione
    NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve
flattened on Wednesday, with two-year yields touching their
highest since mid-2009 and long-dated yields falling, as
investors braced for a Federal Reserve rate increase and the
potential for a more aggressive pace of future hikes. 
    U.S. two-year yields, which are considered most vulnerable
to Fed policy, rose to 1.401 percent, their highest since June
2009, while three-year yields hit 1.700 percent, their highest 
since April 2010. U.S. 30-year yields fell as much as three
basis points and benchmark 10-year yields declined by as much as
two. 
    Interest rates futures implied traders saw a 93 percent
chance the Fed would announce it was raising rates by a quarter
percentage-point at the end of its two-day meeting, CME Group's
FedWatch program showed. That was up from 90.8 percent Tuesday. 
    "Investors are paying their respect that today's a Fed
hiking day, and the two year yield is more sensitive to the
moves, so that's why it's moving up," said George Goncalves,
head of U.S. rates strategy at Nomura in New York.
    The Fed is scheduled to release its latest policy statement
along with updated economic forecasts at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference half an
hour later.
    Attention is turning to whether the U.S. central bank will
signal an even faster pace of monetary tightening this year than
the current three rate hikes that it projected at its December
meeting.
    Longer-dated yields fell since rate increases reduce
inflation expectations, thereby boosting longer-dated Treasuries
prices and pushing their yields lower since inflation is a risk
to the debt because it erodes their interest payouts.
    Data showing a steady increase in inflation, with the
consumer price index posting its biggest year-on-year increase
in nearly five years in February, reinforced expectations for a
Fed rate increase Wednesday and a potential uptick in the Fed's
projected number of rate hikes this year.
    "The Fed would have had this data, and the market
expectation might be that the probability of them sounding
hawkish might have marginally gone up," said Aaron Kohli, an
interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
    Benchmark 10-year Treasuries prices were last up
1/32 to yield 2.589 percent, from a yield of 2.595 percent late
Tuesday. 
    U.S. two-year notes were last down 1/32 in price to yield
1.397 percent, from a yield of 1.380 percent late Tuesday.

 SEEconomy   HDU.S. Consumer Prices Rose 0.1% in February; Sign that inflation is near Fed's target and likely clearing path for higher interest rates   BYBy Josh Mitchell and Jeffrey Sparshott    WC367 words   PD15 March 2017   ET13:31   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

   LPWASHINGTON—U.S. consumer prices rose further in February, the latest sign inflation is near the Federal Reserve's target and likely clearing the path for higher interest rates.

The consumer-price index, measuring what Americans pay for everything from cars to dental care, increased 0.1% in February from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Outside of energy and food costs, so-called core prices rose 0.2%.
   TDThe figures matched economists' expectations and bolster the Fed's view of underlying strength in the economy. Consumer prices have risen 2.7% over the past year, the biggest annual gain since the 12 months through March 2012. Core prices have risen 2.2% from a year earlier.

The Fed monitors the index and other inflation measures as it aims for stable price growth, defined as 2% annually as measured by a separate index from the Commerce Department. All measures are generally pointing toward a modest but noticeable pickup in prices after years of stagnant growth. That development, coupled with steady job growth, is expected to lead the Fed to announce later Wednesday another rise in its benchmark interest rate.

The Fed's preferred measure—the Commerce Department's price index for personal-consumption expenditures—showed earlier this month that prices climbed 1.9% in January from a year earlier.

Wednesday's report showed most major consumer expenses are rising. Food costs climbed 0.2% from a month earlier. The cost of clothing and rent also increased.

Energy costs fell 1% from January but were still 15% higher from a year ago. Prices of new used vehicles also fell from the prior month.

Separately Wednesday, the Labor Department said workers' earnings grew modestly. Private sector workers earned an average 0.1% more a week, after inflation, compared with the prior month. Their earnings rose because of an increase in hourly wages and steady weekly hours.

    * Most of the Asian currencies trading flat
    * US rate hike impact would not be severe this time-analysts
    * Indian rupee sees more gains on inflation data

 (Adds text, updates prices)
    By Patturaja  Murugaboopathy 
    March 15 (Reuters) - Asian currencies were largely flat on
Wednesday as investors  nervously awaited an expected U.S.
interest rate hike later in the day and hoped for more clues on
the pace of future tightening.
    Beside the expected announcement of a quarter-point rate
rise (1800 GMT), the Federal Reserve will also reveal a fresh
"dot plot" that could signal whether most of its policy
committee now expect more than three rate increases this year.  
 
    The "dot plot" is policymakers' rate projections and
provides a view into their interest rate outlook.
    Some market watchers wonder whether the new chart may point
to the possibility of four rate rises this year, reflecting a
brighter economic outlook.
    The Indian rupee and the South Korean won
 rose while most of the other regional currencies were
trading flat.
    "We expect the fed funds target range to increase by 25
basis points. This should be the start of a more prolonged, yet
gradual pace of rate hikes, in contrast to the past two years,
when the Fed paused its rate hike cycle." said Maritza Cabezas,
senior economist for ABN AMRO, in a research note. 
    A few analysts said the Asian currencies would see less
impact this time, unlike during the "taper tantrum" of 2013, in
which some currencies such as Indian rupee and
Indonesian rupiah fell sharply.
    "Last time it was a pure yield adjustment in spite of an
absence of growth or demand in the U.S. This time around, the
difference is some of the upward yield movement is coming on the
hopes of growth being posted by fiscal stimulus in the U.S.,"
said Vishnu Varathan, senior economist at Mizhuo.
    "The sell-off in (Asian currencies) will be not be as acute
this time."
    Policy decisions at the Bank of England and the Japanese
central bank alongside a Dutch election vote within the next 36
hours also kept the investors cautious on Wednesday.
    
    Indian rupee
    The Indian rupee was up 0.4 percent at 65.525 per dollar,
the highest since November 2015.
    The rupee bucked the trend of other regional currencies, as
it rose further on the back of strong election results and 
inflation data.
    On Tuesday, the data from the Ministry of Statistics showed
the consumer prices rose by an annual 3.65 percent in February
compared with January's 3.17 percent increase
    "Core pressures should begin to build in the months ahead,
effectively narrowing the room for the Reserve Bank of India to
lower rates further." said DBS in a research note.

 HDGlobal Stocks Lower Ahead of Fed Rate Decision   BYBy Ese Erheriene    WC466 words   PD15 March 2017   ET04:25   SNDow Jones Institutional News   SCDJDN   LAEnglish   CYCopyright © 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
   LPAsian shares were broadly lower Wednesday, tracking losses in the U.S., as the market cautiously awaited a decision on interest rates by the Federal Reserve.

In keeping with the theme of quiet anticipation that has dominated markets for much of the week, selling was modest ahead of the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the global trading day.
   TDThe Nikkei Stock Average was 0.4% lower in morning trade, sticking within a narrow 53-point range. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ticked down 0.3%, led by declines in its financial sector. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 0.6% lower.

"All eyes [are] on the interest-rate decision tonight," said Jane Fu, a sales trader at CMC Markets.

Futures trading indicates a 93% likelihood of a rate rise, according to CME Group data.

Oil-and-gas companies across the region continued their slide, after U.S. crude prices closed lower for the seventh session in a row. While oil futures have rebounded in Asia trade, that hasn't lifted equities, reflecting investor uncertainty on how long crude's bounce will last.

Japanese oil explorer Inpex was down 1.5%, while distributor JX was off 1.3%. In Australia, Santos slipped 0.4%.

In Japan, Toshiba's woes continued as the firm skidded further Wednesday on concerns about its nuclear business and a possible delisting. Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said late Tuesday the company is considering a bankruptcy filing for its troubled U.S. nuclear affiliate Westinghouse Electric Co. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange placed Toshiba's shares under special supervision, a warning to investors that the stock could be delisted. Its shares were down 6.5%.

"It looks increasingly likely that Toshiba may need to go through a bank-sponsored restructuring," said Jefferies analysts. "It is hard to see Toshiba handling all of its problems on its own."

Meanwhile, continuously shrinking manufacturing jobs, corporate restructurings in heavily indebted industries and sluggish domestic demand pushed South Korea's unemployment rate to a one-year high in February at 4%. The benchmark Kospi index was down 0.2%.

Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both off 0.3%.

In addition to the U.S. rate decision, markets will be watching out for U.S. retail sales and inflation data, as well as reports on U.S. oil stocks.
