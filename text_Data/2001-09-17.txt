   LP LONDON (AP) - The Bank of England cut its key lending rate by a quarter percentage point Tuesday, following cuts that central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan made in a coordinated effort to buoy consumer borrowing and spending in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks. 

 Britain's central bank cut its base rate to 4.75 percent despite worries the move could exacerbate inflationary pressures already building in the economy. 
   TD The bank's monetary policy committee has already trimmed its base rate four times this year for a total reduction of 1 percent in an effort to head off a possible recession. 

 Those fears multiplied after last Tuesday's attacks in New York and Washington. Monday's plunge in U.S. shares on Wall Street has reinforced concerns that the American economy could topple into recession and drag other countries with it. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off a series of interest rate cuts by the world's most influential central banks when it announced a reduction of a half percentage point in the federal funds rate Monday, just an hour before U.S. stock markets reopened after a four-session suspension. 

 The European Central Bank announced it dropped its main rate by the same amount a few hours later, and the Bank of Japan followed suit with a cut of 0.15 percentage points in its key rate early Tuesday. 

 By making its cut, the Bank of England hopes to keep the British economy humming and help remove the jitters that have sent stock markets gyrating during the past several days. 

 "Falls in stock markets around the world, and the likely impact on confidence, suggest a weaker outlook for global activity than appeared likely at the committee's meeting earlier this month," the bank's committee said in a statement. 

 The London Stock Exchange was trading 2.39 percent below Monday's close immediately prior to the bank's cut. Other European stock markets were also trading lower despite Monday's rate reduction by the ECB. 

 While the Bank of England's action had been widely anticipated, the bank had to strike a balance between trying to stimulate the economy and keeping inflation at or below the government's annual target of 2.5 percent. 

 The Office for National Statistics reported earlier Tuesday that Britain's underlying rate of inflation jumped in August to its highest level in more than two years - up 0.4 percent to 2.6 percent. Higher costs for gasoline and seasonal foods were the main cause, it said. 

 The base rate is what the Bank of England charges other financial institutions, and it serves as the bank's main tool for fighting inflation. A cut in the base rate makes loans cheaper and therefore stimulates borrowing and overall economic activity. 

 The bank's rate cut should benefit consumers and homeowners by making consumer loans and mortgages cheaper. It also should help keep the pound in line with the euro and other major currencies so that exporters do not suffer losses in sales. 

 "There is a real risk of worldwide economic slowdown, which is why this cut is absolutely vital," said John Monks, head of the Trade Union Congress. "Coordination must now continue and the Bank and the government must stand ready for further action."

 HD Japan's central bank eases monetary policy in line with U.S., Europe    BY By YURI KAGEYAMA    CRAP Business Writer   WC374 words   PD18 September 2001   ET13:03   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.
   LP TOKYO (AP) - Japan's central bank lowered a symbolic but key interest rate Tuesday to show its solidarity with the United States and Europe in an international effort to squelch a possible economic free fall following the terrorist attacks on America. 

 The Bank of Japan lowered the official discount rate - the rate the central bank charges financial institutions for loans - to 0.10 percent from 0.25 percent. 
   TD The bank's move had been expected after the Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank cut interest rates overnight by a half point in a coordinated international effort. But the Bank of Japan's options were more limited than its overseas counterparts as it already lowered interest rates to near zero earlier this year. 

 "I think we are in a new age of international cooperation," Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka said. 

 The central banks of Great Britain, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Taiwan and Hong Kong also cut interest rates this week to match the Federal Reserve. 

 Last week, after making $101 billion in overnight loans available to banks, the European Central Bank withdrew $10.1 billion from the banking system Tuesday in an indication that officials feel enough has been done to ensure that banks have enough cash. 

 The Bank of Japan, which pumped an extra $17 billion into the market, will continue to make ample money available, Gov. Masaru Hayami promised. The bank did not give a specific figure. 

 The moves come at a difficult time for Japan, where the global electronics slowdown has sent corporate profits falling and deadened exports. Last Wednesday, the day after the terrorist attacks, the Nikkei Stock Average, the main index for Tokyo shares, dipped below the symbolically key 10,000 point level. 

 It fell 5 percent Monday to a new 18-year low on jitters about a plunge on Wall Street. The Nikkei recovered nearly 2 percent Tuesday after investors were relieved that the fall in New York was within expectations. 

 Japan also faces the danger of deflation - a situation in which prices fall in a downward spiral and bring down income and profits, further damaging the economy.

 HD Japan's central bank follows U.S., Europe in providing more money in market    BY By YURI KAGEYAMA    CRAP Business Writer   WC616 words   PD18 September 2001   ET12:15   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001.

   LP TOKYO (AP) - Although its moves were largely symbolic, Japan's central bank showed its determination to work with its international counterparts Tuesday in maintaining stability in global markets shaken by the terrorist attacks on the United States. 

 The Bank of Japan's options were more limited than other nations' central banks because interest rates here are already near zero. But it lowered the largely symbolic official discount rate - the rate the central bank charges financial institutions - to 0.10 percent from 0.25 percent. 
   TD Anticipation the bank would ease monetary policy helped lift share prices Tuesday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where trading ended before the BOJ announcement. The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average gained nearly 2 percent, recovering from a 5 percent plunge Monday to a new 18-year low. 

 "I think we are in a new age of international cooperation," Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka said. "The speedy decision on the part of the central bank is what's important." 

 The Bank of Japan's move had been expected after earlier interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board, the European Central Bank and other central banks in a coordinated effort to help the world's financial markets ward off the shock effects of the attacks. 

 The central banks of Great Britain, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Taiwan and Hong Kong also cut interest rates this week to match the Federal Reserve. 

 The Bank of Japan said it was taking "every necessary measure" to prevent any confusion in financial markets from the terrorist attacks. 

 It promised to continue to make ample money available, maintaining the extra 2 trillion yen (dlrs 17 billion) it has pumped into the market as an emergency measure following the attacks. 

 That had raised the amount of yen in the market from the bank's previous target of 6 trillion yen (dlrs 51 billion) to about 8 trillion yen (dlrs 68 billion). The bank did not give a specific figure for a new target. 

 The bank also extended the days that financial institutions can borrow from the central bank at the official discount rate to 10 days from five days. 

 Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami said some of the yen in the market used when the central bank intervened Monday to support the U.S. dollar won't be removed in an effort to keep more money in the market. Usually the central bank absorbs the extra yen that arises from currency interventions. 

 The dollar has slid steadily in the last week, dropping by as much as 5 yen at one point to 116 yen levels. It has rebounded since then to 117.82 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo, up 0.04 yen from late Monday. 

 A high yen hurts export-oriented economies like Japan because it reduces the value of overseas earnings and makes Japanese products more expensive abroad. 

 "The bank strongly hopes that steady progress in structural reforms will continue overcoming the effect of the recent tragedy in the United States," the Bank of Japan said in a statement. 

 Japan is burdened with deep economic problems that are almost certain to worsen if the global economy doesn't pick up. 

 It faces the danger of deflation - a situation in which prices fall in a downward spiral and bring down income and profits, further damaging the economy. 

 Another major problem is the estimated 43 trillion yen (dlrs 365 billion) in problem loans at the nation's banks. The unemployment rate is at 5 percent, the highest since the government began keeping track in 1953.

 HD Danish central bank lowers lending rate following ECB move, attacks on the United States    WC250 words   PD18 September 2001   ET10:36   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.
   LP COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - The Danish central bank on Tuesday lowered its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4.15 percent from 4.65 percent in a follow-up move to rate cuts by the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

 "After the terror attack on the United States, a series of central banks have lowered official rates with 0.5 percentage points to counteract the increase of insecurity of the economic development that is a consequence of the attacks," the Nationalbanken said in a statement. 
   TD The Danish bank also lowered its other main rate, the discount rate, by 50 percentage points to 3.75 percent. 

 The cuts were effective immediately. 

 On Monday, the ECB joined with the Fed in supplying quick credit to keep banks running smoothly following the attacks last week and on Monday it cut its key interest rate by 50 points to 3.75 percent. 

 Denmark is one of three European Union members outside the European Monetary Union and its currency, the euro. However, it closely tracks the moves of the Frankfurt-based ECB. 

 The last time the Danish central bank cut rates was Aug. 30, also in a tag along move to an ECB rate easing. 

 The discount rate signals the overall level of the central bank's interest rates, while the lending rate indicates the interest rate on banks short-term transactions.

 HD WRAPUP 1-Muted U.S. inflation leaves room for rate cuts.    BY By Mark Egan    WC814 words   PD18 September 2001   ET17:43   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
   LP WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. inflation was muted in August, kept in check by falling energy prices, the government said on Tuesday in a report that should reassure the Federal Reserve that there is room for further interest rate cuts if needed to keep confidence afloat. 

 With expectations high that the U.S. central bank will lower borrowing costs again to keep the world's richest economy from contracting after last week's devastating attacks, the earliest economic data that included the period since the strikes painted a bleak picture. 
   TD Weekly retail sales data showed that customers stayed away from stores following attacks in New York and Washington last Tuesday - confirming expectations that the events would hammer the retail sector, at least in the short term. 

 The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, the nation's broadest gauge of inflation, rose 0.1 percent in August after a decline of 0.3 percent in July, less than the 0.2 percent gain economists polled by Reuters had expected. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the index rose 0.2 percent, in line with what economists forecast, after a matching rise in July. 

 Well Fargo Chief Economist Sung Won Sohn said the combined data showed no inflation concerns and weakening demand, making further rate cuts both likely and feasible. 

 "Inflation is just not an issue. With the economy softening, the inflation pressure will decelerate further," Sohn said. "Consumer spending has been decelerating and will continue to do so in the near future." 

 "The Fed is concerned about financial stability and boosting economic growth, so they will continue to cut interest rates," Sohn added. 

 On Monday, the U.S. central bank slashed interest rates by half a percentage point to help dampen the effect of the attacks on consumer confidence. The world's major central banks followed suit, either on Monday or Tuesday. 

 TAME INFLATION 

 The lack of significant price pressures should offer solace to the inflation-wary Fed, giving it freedom to wield rate cuts as a weapon against recession. 

 If retail sales data released on Tuesday are any indication of how consumers will react after Tuesday's attacks, the central bank may need to stay particularly vigilant. 

 U.S. retail sales at discount, chain and department stores fell 3.2 percent in the first two weeks of September as most retailers closed on the day of the attacks, the Redbook Average revealed. And a separate report from the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg showed U.S. chain store sales fell 1.4 percent in the week ended September 15 - the largest weekly drop since the end of March. 

 That report showed sales on September 11, the day of the strikes, fell a massive 50-55 percent compared with the same week of the the prior year for many nationwide stores. 

 Economists are worried about the effect last Tuesday's attacks, when hijacked airplanes flattened the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon near Washington, will have on consumer confidence. 

 The American consumer accounts for two-thirds of economic activity and has kept the U.S. economy from contracting in recent months even as some sectors, most notably manufacturing, are in a full-blown recession. 

 "I expect the Fed will continue cutting," said Kurt Karl, chief U.S. economist at Swiss Re, echoing a sentiment widely held on Wall Street. But he said that given the aggression of Monday's move, he expects the next cut to be a more modest quarter of a percentage point. 

 Inflation was reined in by falling energy prices, which slipped 1.9 percent in August after a 5.6 percent decline in the previous month. Gasoline prices fell 2.4 percent in August after an 11 percent decline during the previous month. 

 So far this year, the Fed has cut interest eight times to help boost the economy, three times in relatively rare moves between regularly scheduled policy meetings. But even after Monday's rate cut, most economists expect the powerful central bank to act again when it next meets on Oct. 2. 

 DATA MOOT 

 Although it was seen as leaving room for rate cuts, the August inflation report is viewed as moot because the economic landscape has been radically altered by last week's events. 

 Since then, energy prices have soared and stocks, which opened on Monday after almost a week-long closure of U.S. stock exchanges, plummeted 7 percent to 1998 levels by the close of that first day of trade. 

 On Tuesday, stocks traded modestly higher. 

 With stocks at such low levels, keeping U.S. consumer confidence buoyant is the primary concern of policymakers both at the Fed and the U.S. Treasury Department as the risks of recession have heightened significantly.

 HDCentral banks follow Fed and cut interest rates.   BYBy ED CROOKS, ECONOMICS EDITOR.    WC363 words   PD18 September 2001   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPCentral banks around the world on Tuesday followed the lead set by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in cutting interest rates on Monday.

The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England both made reductions, as did Hong Kong, Taiwan, Denmark and Kuwait.
   TDBut some analysts suggested that the monetary policy easing in Japan and the UK had fallen short of the dramatic steps taken by the ECB and the Fed to help stabilise markets in the wake of last week's terrorists attacks in the US.

The Bank of Japan cut its official discount rate by 0.1 percentage points to 0.15 per cent and raised its upper limit for liquidity to be injected into the market.

The move demonstrated solidarity with the international initiative to ease monetary policy but was not expected to have a strong effect on the Japanese economy, as short-term interest rates were already close to zero and there is excess liquidity in the financial system.

The Bank of England chose to cut its main rate by 0.25 percentage points, following a meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday morning.

The cut took UK interest rates to 4.75 per cent - the lowest level for the Bank's main interest rate since 1964 - and British businesses and investors welcomed the move. But some analysts accused the Bank of showing indecision by failing to match fully the half-point reduction made by the Fed, the ECB and the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden and Canada on Monday.

The Bank said on Tuesday that the rate cut was not part of a concerted international move. The MPC's statement released to accompany its decision said the committee had "considered the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce interest rates yesterday (Monday), and the responses of other central banks to that move".

European stock markets generally closed lower: the main German, French and British indices all closing about 1 per cent lower.

In afternoon trading in New York, however, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 45.7 at 8966.4.

 HDASSUALT ON AMERICA ECONOMY - Timing crucial as Fed moves to shore up confidence RATE CUTS CENTRAL BANK ...   BYBy GERARD BAKER.    WC815 words   PD18 September 2001   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPASSUALT ON AMERICA ECONOMY - Timing crucial as Fed moves to shore up confidence RATE CUTS CENTRAL BANK USES EXTRAORDINARY MEETING TO EMPHASISE ITS COMMITMENT TO HELPING MARKETS IN WAKE OF THE.

At 7.30 yesterday morning, as a solemn Wall Street was preparing to reopen its stock markets after a four-day suspension in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks, the members of the Federal Reserve's policymaking open market committee began an extraordinary meeting in an extraordinary way.
   TDAt the Fed's offices in Washington, and on the other end of telephones at the district reserve banks around the country, the FOMC members were patched into an emergency conference call. Before considering the central bank's response to the terrorist outrages, Alan Greenspan, the chairman, suggested they pause for a moment's silence in honour of the victims of the attacks in New York and Washington.

Then, in a brief but highly consequential discussion, they speedily approved the chairman's recommendation that they cut interest rates for the eighth time this year.

Fifty minutes later, a little over an hour before the markets reopened, the news wires carried the Fed's decision - a half point cut in the central bank's key interest rate target, the fed funds rate, and the same half point cut for the more symbolic discount rate.

Within hours the Fed's move was followed by similar rate cuts by the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank and other central banks across the Atlantic.

But it was the US, where stock prices slumped yesterday amid concern about the ability of the US economy to withstand the shocks of last week, that was the focus of policymakers' attention.

That the Fed would cut rates after last week's events was no surprise - the only real question was the timing. Should the Fed wait a day or two to see how investors had acted after Monday's reopening? Or should it try to shore up confidence with a pre-emptive cut even before the markets opened?

It was this question of timing rather than the fact or the scale of the action that seems to have provided the trickiest challenge for the Fed officials.

In the end what seems to have prompted them to move even before the markets opened was not just a desire to be pre-emptive, but to provide a concrete expression of reassurance.

Some economists close to the Fed thought the central bankers probably felt the need to remove any uncertainty about their plans before the markets opened. Given the overhang of personal grief and uncertainty already pressing on financial markets from the loss of family and friends, the phys ical damage to the stock exchanges and companies in the area, as well as the much broader uncertainty about the outlook for companies in the wake of the attacks, taking the Fed immediately out of the equation in a supportive way seemed to be the dictation of prudence.

But the central bank also went out of its way to ensure there was no doubt that it was prepared to do much more to help out. Not only did it retain its policy "tilt" - the pro-forma statement that said the Fed saw the risks weighted more towards economic weakness than towards inflationary pressures.

It also, unusually, promised to provide enough liquidity through market operations to ensure the Fed funds rate would actually be kept somewhat below the new target level of 3 per cent, an additional and welcome relief for distressed financial institutions.

The maintenance of the "tilt" towards further easing strongly suggests that interest rates are set to go lower still at the next scheduled meeting of the open market committee on October 2.

After a summer in which policymakers had appeared to be preparing financial markets for the imminent end of the long phase of interest rate cuts, the other important message yesterday was that, even before the tragedy in New York and Washington, the Fed's optimism about an early recovery was ebbing.

Now the principal question is how the markets move in the wake of the Fed's efforts and whether that prompts the central bank to do more.

Although economists seem almost universally convinced that US growth has slowed to zero or is even negative, there is equally widespread hope that the renewed aggressive monetary policy measures and the likely fiscal stimulus is going to lift growth more strongly than previously expected early next year.

With the rest of the world at last joining the US in aggressive measures to restore growth, many economists are again talking of a V-shaped recovery - a steeper fall in the next few months than they had previously expected, but a stronger bounce back.

   LPASSAULT ON AMERICA ECONOMY - Central bank governors quick to demonstrate their support SUPPORT FOR MARKETS.

Central banks in Canada, Switzerland and Sweden yesterday followed the US Federal Reserve and announced rate cuts, while the Japanese government indicated it was seeking to support the US markets.
   TDThe Bank of Canada cut interest rates by half a point in an effort to shore up business and consumer confidence following last week's terrorist attacks on the US.

The BoC move takes the target for the overnight rate, the bank's key policy rate, to 3.5 per cent, its lowest since November 1977. "The tragic acts of terrorism in the US on September 11 may pose significant challenges to consumer and business confidence in the US, Canada, and elsewhere," the bank said in a statement.

Canadian markets responded positively to the cut. The Toronto Stock Exchange, which reopened for business on Thursday, registered gains in mid-morning trading.

The Swiss National Bank, which had originally planned to announce its interest rate targets on Thursday, announced a half-point cut in its target range for three-month Libor to 2.25-3.25 per cent.

The SNB said the decision to bring forward its announcement was designed "to counter any insecurity in the financial markets".

Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, last night cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.75 per cent after its executive board held an extraordinary meeting in Stockholm. Even before last week's US attacks, the Riksbank had been under pressure to cut its main repurchase rate in response to a slowdown in the Swedish economy and cuts in European Central Bank rates.

Sweden, like the UK, is an EU member but not a member of the eurozone.

There was little concrete indication yesterday that intervention by the Japanese monetary authorities is part of aclosely co-ordinated master plan. Japanese officials suggested the Bank of Japan's intervention in the currency markets was primarily designed to stabilise and calm the markets ahead of the US stock markets' opening - and, above all, to stop the dollar's slide from accelerating - rather than a serious attempt to change the direction of currency trends. "This was a holding measure," said one official.

In practice the interests of the Japanese and US monetary authorities do not appear to be aligned now: the Japanese are reluctant to see the yen strengthen, and consider any level stronger than Y120 to the dollar to be undesirable; the US authorities' commitment to a strong dollar, however, appears to be wavering.

It is also unclear whether the Japanese central bank is willing to participate in a global easing policy. The Bank of Japan, which holds a regular monetary meeting today, says it is keen to support any global initiative to stabilise markets.

However, it has few policy measures in its arsenal which it could use to make any "grand statement". Reporting by Ken Warn in Toronto, William Hall in Zurich, Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm and Gillian Tett in Tokyo.

 HDASSAULT ON AMERICA ECONOMY - Fed's pre-emptive strike to shore up confidence RATE CUTS SOME ECONOMISTS ...   BYBy GERARD BAKER.    WC800 words   PD18 September 2001   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPASSAULT ON AMERICA ECONOMY - Fed's pre-emptive strike to shore up confidence RATE CUTS SOME ECONOMISTS SAY CENTRAL BANKERS' TIMING SEEKS TO REMOVE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PLANS IN THE AFTERMATH.

That the Federal Reserve was going to cut interest rates after last week's murderous assault on the US was inevitable.
   TDThe shock to financial markets and the potentially savage blows to business and consumer confidence were certain to prompt the US central bank to provide further support in addition to the seven rate cuts it has already produced this year.

The only real doubt among market participants seemed to be as to the timing. Should the Fed wait a day or two to see how investors had acted after Monday's reopening? Or should it try to shore up confidence with a pre-emptive cut even before the markets opened?

As traders returned in sombre mood to their offices and exchanges in lower Manhattan yesterday, the answer came quickly.

At 8.30 the decision by the central bank's open market committee hit the news wires - the Fed's policymakers had decided to cut its two key interest rates by 50 basis points.

When the Fed's action was soon followed by similar rate cuts by the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank and other central banks across the Atlantic, it was clear that the monetary easing was part of a broader concerted effort to provide stability and reassurance to the world's fragile financial markets.

But there were also strong clues, in the statement accompanying the rate change, about the Fed's broader policy approach to the US economy in the changed world around it.

It was the precise timing rather than the fact or the scale of the action that seems to have provided the trickiest challenge for Alan Greenspan and his colleagues.

In the end what seems to have prompted them to move even before the markets opened was not just a desire to be pre-emptive, but to provide a concrete expression of reassurance.

Some economists close to the Fed thought the central bankers probably felt the need to remove any uncertainty about their plans promptly before the markets opened. Given the overhang of personal grief and uncer tainty already pressing on financial markets from the loss of family and friends, the physical damage to the stock exchanges and companies in the area, as well as the much broader uncertainty about the outlook for companies in the wake of the attacks, taking the Fed immediately out of the equation in a supportive way seemed to be the dictation of prudence.

But the central bank also went out of its way to ensure there was no doubt that it was prepared to do much more to help out. Not only did it retain its policy "tilt" - the pro-forma statement that said the Fed sees the risks weighted more towards economic weakness than towards inflationary pressures.

It also - unusually - promised to provide enough liquidity through market operations to ensure that the Fed funds rate would actually be kept somewhat below the new target level of 3 per cent, an additional and welcome relief for distressed financial institutions.

"It's notable that the Fed intends to err on the side of missing to the low side," said Robert DiClemente, chief US economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "In this manner its daily operations carry the same bias that its fundamental outlook does."

The maintenance of the "tilt" towards further easing was also strongly suggestive that interest rates are set to go lower still at the next scheduled meeting of the open market committee on October 2.

After a summer in which policymakers had appeared to be preparing financial markets for the imminent end of the long phase of interest rate cuts - the other important message yesterday was that, even before the tragedy in New York and Washington, the Fed's optimism about an early recovery was ebbing.

Now the principal question how the markets continue to move in the wake of the Fed's efforts - and whether that prompts the central bank to do more.

Though economists seem almost universally convinced that US growth has slowed to zero or is even negative, there is equally widespread hope that the renewed aggressive monetary policy measures and the likely fiscal stimulus is going to lift growth more strongly than previously expected early next year.

With the rest of the world at last joining the US in aggressive measures to restore growth, many economists are once again talking of a "V-shaped" recovery - a steeper fall in the next few months than they had previously expected, but a stronger bounceback.

 HD British, Japanese Banks Cut Rates    BY By BRUCE STANLEY    CRAP Business Writer   WC641 words   PD18 September 2001   SNAP Online   SCASP   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
   LP LONDON (AP) - Coordinating efforts to shore up sagging consumer confidence, the central banks of Britain and Japan dropped key interest rates Tuesday to match similar cuts in the United States, Canada and continental Europe after last week's terrorist attacks. 

 The Bank of England cut its base rate by a quarter-point to 4.75 percent, an hour after the Bank of Japan trimmed its official discount rate by 0.15 percentage points to 0.10 percent. The rates are what both central banks charge other financial institutions for loans, and are an important tool for stimulating consumer demand and fighting inflation. 
   TD Tuesday's cuts came as little surprise after the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada slashed their main rates by a half-point each on Monday. 

 Together, the banks aim to restore confidence in global financial markets which were badly shaken by the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. By doing so, they hope to stave off a world recession. 

 Fears of a recession grew after U.S. share prices plunged when trading resumed Monday on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.1 percent in its biggest-ever point loss, while the Nasdaq tumbled 6.8 percent. But Wall Street staged a modest rally Tuesday, with the Dow climbing back above 9,000 in early afternoon trading. 

 European stock markets wallowed in the red Tuesday amid fears that Wall Street could suffer further losses later in the day. In Asia, an earlier rally in stocks petered out and left some regional exchanges with losses. 

 The Bank of England cut its base rate despite worries the move could exacerbate inflationary pressures already building in the United Kingdom. 

 "Falls in stock markets around the world, and the likely impact on confidence, suggest a weaker outlook for global activity than appeared likely at the committee's meeting earlier this month," the Bank of England said in a statement. 

 "It is too early to make an informed judgment about the scale of the impact on the U.K. economy. But the direction of that impact and the associated risks are clear." 

 The Office for National Statistics highlighted the balancing act required of the Bank of England when it reported Tuesday that Britain's underlying rate of inflation jumped in August to its highest level in more than two years. Higher costs for gasoline and seasonal foods pushed inflation up 0.4 percentage points to 2.6 percent, it said. 

 The British rate cut should benefit consumers and homeowners by making consumer loans and mortgages cheaper. It also should help keep the pound in line with the euro and other major currencies so that exporters do not suffer losses in sales. 

 "There is a real risk of worldwide economic slowdown, which is why this cut is absolutely vital," said John Monks, head of the Trade Union Congress. 

 Smaller central banks in Kuwait, Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Taiwan have taken a cue from the Federal Reserve and cut interest rates. 

 The Bank of Japan's cut was largely symbolic. The bank has already slashed interest rates almost to zero in a failed effort to revive the moribund Japanese economy. 

 The Bank of Japan also pumped an extra 2 trillion yen ($17 billion) into the market. It has raised the amount of yen in the market from the bank's previous target of 6 trillion yen ($51 billion) to about 8 trillion yen ($68 billion). 

 The Bank of Japan also increased the number of days that financial institutions can borrow at the official discount rate to 10 days from five days. Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami promised to continue to make ample money available.

 HD Bank of England Cuts Lending Rate    BY By BRUCE STANLEY    CRAP Business Writer   WC572 words   PD18 September 2001   SNAP Online   SCASP   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
   LP LONDON (AP) - The Bank of England cut its key lending rate by a quarter percentage point Tuesday, following cuts that central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan made in a coordinated effort to buoy consumer borrowing and spending in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks. 

 Britain's central bank cut its base rate to 4.75 percent despite worries the move could exacerbate inflationary pressures already building in the economy. 
   TD The bank's monetary policy committee has already trimmed its base rate four times this year for a total reduction of 1 percent in an effort to head off a possible recession. 

 Those fears multiplied after last Tuesday's attacks in New York and Washington. Monday's plunge in U.S. shares on Wall Street has reinforced concerns that the American economy could topple into recession and drag other countries with it. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off a series of interest rate cuts by the world's most influential central banks when it announced a reduction of a half percentage point in the federal funds rate Monday, just an hour before U.S. stock markets reopened after a four-session suspension. 

 The European Central Bank announced it dropped its main rate by the same amount a few hours later, and the Bank of Japan followed suit with a cut of 0.15 percentage points in its key rate early Tuesday. 

 By making its cut, the Bank of England hopes to keep the British economy humming and help remove the jitters that have sent stock markets gyrating during the past several days. 

 "Falls in stock markets around the world, and the likely impact on confidence, suggest a weaker outlook for global activity than appeared likely at the committee's meeting earlier this month," the bank's committee said in a statement. 

 The London Stock Exchange was trading 2.39 percent below Monday's close immediately prior to the bank's cut. Other European stock markets were also trading lower despite Monday's rate reduction by the ECB. 

 While the Bank of England's action had been widely anticipated, the bank had to strike a balance between trying to stimulate the economy and keeping inflation at or below the government's annual target of 2.5 percent. 

 The Office for National Statistics reported earlier Tuesday that Britain's underlying rate of inflation jumped in August to its highest level in more than two years - up 0.4 percent to 2.6 percent. Higher costs for gasoline and seasonal foods were the main cause, it said. 

 The base rate is what the Bank of England charges other financial institutions, and it serves as the bank's main tool for fighting inflation. A cut in the base rate makes loans cheaper and therefore stimulates borrowing and overall economic activity. 

 The bank's rate cut should benefit consumers and homeowners by making consumer loans and mortgages cheaper. It also should help keep the pound in line with the euro and other major currencies so that exporters do not suffer losses in sales. 

 "There is a real risk of worldwide economic slowdown, which is why this cut is absolutely vital," said John Monks, head of the Trade Union Congress. "Coordination must now continue and the Bank and the government must stand ready for further action."

   LP TOKYO (AP) - Japan's central bank lowered a symbolic but key interest rate Tuesday to show its solidarity with the United States and Europe in an international effort to squelch a possible economic free fall following the terrorist attacks on America. 

 The Bank of Japan lowered the official discount rate - the rate the central bank charges financial institutions for loans - to 0.10 percent from 0.25 percent. 
   TD The bank's move had been expected after the Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank cut interest rates overnight by a half point in a coordinated international effort. But the Bank of Japan's options were more limited than its overseas counterparts as it already lowered interest rates to near zero earlier this year. 

 "I think we are in a new age of international cooperation," Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka said. 

 The central banks of Great Britain, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Taiwan and Hong Kong also cut interest rates this week to match the Federal Reserve. 

 Last week, after making $101 billion in overnight loans available to banks, the European Central Bank withdrew $10.1 billion from the banking system Tuesday in an indication that officials feel enough has been done to ensure that banks have enough cash. 

 The Bank of Japan, which pumped an extra $17 billion into the market, will continue to make ample money available, Gov. Masaru Hayami promised. The bank did not give a specific figure. 

 The moves come at a difficult time for Japan, where the global electronics slowdown has sent corporate profits falling and deadened exports. Last Wednesday, the day after the terrorist attacks, the Nikkei Stock Average, the main index for Tokyo shares, dipped below the symbolically key 10,000 point level. 

 It fell 5 percent Monday to a new 18-year low on jitters about a plunge on Wall Street. The Nikkei recovered nearly 2 percent Tuesday after investors were relieved that the fall in New York was within expectations. 

 Japan also faces the danger of deflation - a situation in which prices fall in a downward spiral and bring down income and profits, further damaging the economy.

 SE International    HD Europe, Canada Reduce Rates After Fed's Cut; Japan Sells Yen    BY By Michael R. Sesit and Michael Williams    CRStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal   WC867 words   PD18 September 2001   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA14   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
   LP LONDON -- Central banks in Europe and Canada matched the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut as part of a global effort to calm markets in the wake of last Tuesday's terrorist attack, while in Japan, government officials sought to counter the rise of the yen against the dollar. 

 The Fed's lowering of its key federal funds rate to 3% was an attempt to maintain consumer, business and investor confidence after the assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but a major beneficiary was the U.S. dollar, which bounced back from its lows for the day after the rate cuts were announced. 
   TD The European Central Bank cut its main interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3.75%. The central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Sweden made similar cuts, with the Bank of Canada reducing its key rate to 3.5% from 4%. Still, the economic fallout from the attack in the U.S., which takes 85% of Canada's exports, is "enough to tip us into red ink," says Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Bank of Montreal's BMO-Nesbitt Burns Inc. securities unit, who forecasts the Canadian economy will contract by 0.5% in the third quarter and 2.1% in the fourth. 

 In Tokyo, government officials stepped up efforts to restructure and stimulate the country's economy, as evidenced by moves yesterday to intervene in currency markets and warn banks to repair their balance sheets. But it remains unclear how aggressively Japan will proceed. The Japanese central bank, acting on the Finance Ministry's behalf, sold yen in an effort to stem the sharp ascent of the currency against the dollar since last week's attack. A stronger yen hurts Japan's exporters, in part by making their goods more expensive in dollar terms. 

 Yet the intervention failed to halt a slide in Japanese share prices. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 5.04% to 9504.41 yesterday, its lowest close since December 1983. In early trading this morning, the Nikkei rose 2.8% on relief that U.S. markets didn't fall further. 

 Late in New York trading, the euro stood at 92.39 U.S. cents, compared with 92.11 cents late Friday. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at 117.70 yen, compared with 117.22 yen on Friday. The pound fell to $1.4660 from $1.4713 before the weekend. 

 The dollar's day didn't begin so brightly, though; in early Asian and European trading, it fell to six-month lows of 93.30 U.S. cents to the euro and 116.70 yen. The Bank of Japan's sales of yen pushed the U.S. currency back as high as 118.35 yen, but it soon fell back on selling by Japanese exporters. 

 The Fed's rate cut encouraged currency traders to bid up the dollar, though some observers warned of further tests for the currency. "President [George W.] Bush is now fighting a war on three fronts: against global terrorism, against economic recession and finally -- perhaps more subtly -- to preserve the complex of U.S. interests in the Middle East, which allows it unlimited access to cheap energy sources," said Christopher Dunn, owner of the Good Trader Web site. 

 Economists in Tokyo are watching whether the Bank of Japan leaves in the markets the extra yen that its intervention put in the hands of investors. Such a move, known as an "unsterilized" intervention, would effectively boost Japan's money supply, thus constituting a form of easing credit. Advocates of using monetary policy to fight the deflation from which Japan has been suffering have long urged unsterilized intervention, but the central bank has resisted, instead removing extra yen from the markets after a yen-selling bout. 

 Today, the central bank's board begins a crucial two-day policy-setting meeting. Private economists say the Bank of Japan may take other easing steps to blunt the business impact of the attacks, perhaps in coordination with the U.S. and European central banks. One step would be to make permanent the emergency additions to one corner of the money supply, banking-system reserves, which the BOJ implemented after the attacks. 

 Even before the terror strikes, the central bank was under pressure from the government to further ease credit by boosting the money supply. The BOJ already lowered interest rates to nearly zero, but its critics say it could still inject more cash into the economy as a way of combating Japan's protracted economic slump and of relieving the pain of restructuring. 

 Meanwhile, Japan's minister of financial services, Hakuo Yanagisawa, yesterday prodded Japanese lenders to get serious about cleaning up nonperforming loans, which have hobbled the banking system for a decade. His comments came the first business day after ailing retailer Mycal Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, following a cutoff of support by its main lender. Mycal's demise is seen as a positive for Japan and its banks, because it removes an inefficient player.

 SE Economy    HD Fed Lowers Interest Rates In Bid to Reassure Markets --- More Decreases May Come, Depending on the Need; ECB Also Cuts Rates    BY By David Wessel    CRStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   WC973 words   PD18 September 2001   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA2   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
   LP WASHINGTON -- Moving to bolster confidence even before the stock market opened, the Federal Reserve cut its target for short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point and promised to continue to supply "unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets, as needed, until more normal market functioning is restored." 

 The Fed's move was followed by the European Central Bank as well as the Canadian and Swiss central banks, but not by the Bank of England. "Following the terrorist attacks on the U.S.," the ECB said, using blunter language than the Fed, "uncertainty about the U.S. and the world economy has increased." 
   TD The Fed left the door open to further rate cuts, emphasizing the weakness that had been seen in employment, production and business spending even before last Tuesday's terror, and the economic risks ahead. 

 The size and timing of the central bank's next move depends on the course taken by the economy and financial markets in the coming weeks. 

 "Any projections about what the economy and the Fed will do in coming months need to be taken as even more tentative than usual," economists at UBS Warburg said, even as they predicted a one-quarter-point interest-rate cut at the Fed's Oct. 2 meeting and another of the same size in November. 

 The rate cut was the Fed's eighth this year and the third it has made between meetings. It takes the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, down to 3%, its lowest since 1994, from 3.5% and from 6.5% at the beginning of the year. Its first five moves this year were half-point cuts, as the Fed fought to keep the economy from sliding into recession. In June, it began moving in quarter-point cuts in recognition of how much stimulus it already had put in the pipeline. Economists had expected more cuts given the lack of signs of economic recovery, but hadn't expected an intermeeting move until after last week's attacks. The return to a half-point move demonstrates how serious Fed policy makers consider the latest setback. 

 In a four-paragraph statement issued at shortly before 8:30 a.m. EDT, the Fed said it would allow the federal-funds rate to dip below 3% "on occasion in these unusual circumstances," a reminder that a key concern now is keeping enough money in the system to keep financial markets going. 

 Several large U.S. commercial banks responded to the Fed rate cut by reducing their prime lending rates by one-half percentage point to 6%, a move that will reduce some corporate and consumer borrowing costs. 

 On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill told CNBC that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan "is always there and always does the right thing." 

 To keep the financial system functioning, the Fed last week aggressively pumped credit into the system, much as it did following the 1987 stock-market crash. As of Friday, the Fed had injected $81.25 billion by temporarily buying government securities from banks and dealers, its usual mode of operations, and had lent banks an additional $45.6 billion directly through its so-called discount window. It also agreed to provide as much as $90 billion to foreign central banks in exchange for foreign currencies. Yesterday, the demand for central-bank cash showed signs of easing, as the Fed's temporary purchases of government securities dropped to $57.25 billion. 

 The Fed yesterday also lowered the discount rate to 2.5%, the lowest that rate has been since 1959. The discount rate is set by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington based on requests from the 12 regional Fed banks. The Fed said five banks -- Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco -- requested the change. Banks have borrowed more heavily than usual from the Fed during the past few days. 

 The ECB's announcement came three hours after the Fed's. The world's No. 2 central bank, which often moves slowly and usually denies it is following the Fed's lead, said explicitly that it was acting "in concert" with the Fed and cut its key short-term rates one-half percentage point to 3.75%. 

 Both the Fed and the ECB emphasized their confidence that the economy's longer-run prospects are strong. The Fed repeated its conviction, most often voiced by Mr. Greenspan, that "the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand would abate." 

 The Bank of Japan has pushed short-term rates near zero, but Japanese authorities Sunday night intervened in currency markets, buying yen for dollars in an apparent effort to restrain the yen's rise. That can be an alternative to rate-cutting for a central bank to try to stimulate its economy. Japanese Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa said Japan intervened alone, but was in contact with the U.S. when it acted. 

 The Bank of England didn't join the global rate-cutting. It has cut short-term rates by one percentage point to 5% this year. The most recent time was a one-quarter percentage-point cut Aug. 2. 

 Late yesterday, the euro was at 92.39 U.S. cents, up from 92.15 cents late Friday in New York. The dollar was at 117.70 yen, up from 117.22 yen late Friday.

 SE Economy    HD Mortgage Rates Ease After Terrorism, But May Not Drop as Much as Expected    BY By Patrick Barta    CRStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   WC640 words   PD18 September 2001   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA2   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
   LP Mortgage rates have eased in the wake of the World Trade Center attack, though market analysts cautioned rates might not fall as far, or as fast, as some had initially expected. 

 Separately, U.S. commercial banks have agreed to postpone foreclosures, suspend late charges and negative credit reporting on Federal Housing Administration and some traditional mortgages held by victims of last Tuesday's attacks. 
   TD Housing and Urban Development Secretary Mel Martinez said that members of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which includes Bank of America Corp.'s Bank of America Mortgage and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., among others, all agreed to participate in the program. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also encouraged lenders to take similar steps. 

 The average rate for a typical 30-year fixed rate loan was about 6.75% yesterday, down only slightly from 6.80% last Monday, according to HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., financial publisher. Last week, mortgage rates rose as lenders sought to hedge against any uncertainties caused by the temporary shutdown of the U.S. bond market. 

 Yesterday, the Federal Reserve lowered a key interest rate by half a percentage point. However, mortgage rates usually move in anticipation of Fed rate moves, and thus this latest cut by itself is unlikely to have much effect, analysts say. 

 The direction of mortgage rates is important right now, due to fears that a recession is more likely in the wake of last week's tragedy. Mortgage rates usually drop when Treasury yields fall, as they have in recent days. Economists are hoping that lower mortgage rates could help prevent the housing market from toppling, as well as spur a new round of refinance activity to help families bolster their household balance sheets. 

 If rates go down a good bit more, "we could get a bigger refinance boom than we've ever had," says David Berson, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage-finance company. Mr. Berson said he does expect rates to decline further, but he and others cautioned that they might not go down as much as people would hope -- ironically, because of fears among investors about the impact of more refinancings. 

 When borrowers refinance their home loans, they pay off old mortgages, a move that deprives investors of expected interest income from borrowers' monthly payments. If refinancing activity surges in the next few weeks, investors could abandon mortgages in favor of safer investments like Treasurys, and that would prevent mortgage rates from falling more, at least until it is clearer what shape the economy is in. 

 For now, "I think we're pretty close to what our floor is for mortgage rates," says Nagy Y. Henein, a mortgage broker at Greater Mortgage Corp. in New City, N.Y. 

 Of course, all bets are off if the economy falls into a deep recession. Then mortgage rates would likely fall further. 

 Mortgage activity did grind to a near-standstill for several days last week, in part because lenders were unclear how to price loans due to the temporary closure of the bond market. But the market was bolstered significantly, lenders said, by the presence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy mortgages from lenders in order to allow banks to make more loans. The companies issued statements by mid-week saying they were continuing to buy mortgages as usual. 

 Dan Gilbert, chief executive officer of Quicken Loans Inc. in Livonia, Mich., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intuit Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., said borrowers have been telling loan officers that they intend to move forward with home purchases because they "don't want this tragedy to stop us."

   LP HONOLULU (AP) - Hawaii's largest banks said Monday they will lower interest rates effective Tuesday by one-half point in response to the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would cut a key interest rate for an eighth time this year. 

 The Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans to 3 percent, the lowest level in nine years. 
   TD Bank of Hawaii, American Savings Bank and First Hawaiian bank cut their prime lending rates from 6.5 percent to 6.0 percent. The prime is the benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans. 

 The Fed action came after an emergency conference call among Fed policy-makers two hours before Wall Street opened for the first time since Tuesday's terrorist attack.

 HD Swedish central bank lowers key  interest rate  after terrorist attacks in U.S.    WC302 words   PD17 September 2001   ET20:15   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.
   LP STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Sweden's Riksbank on Monday followed other central banks and lowered its key securities repurchase agreement rate by 50 basis points to 3.75 percent after last week's terrorist attacks in the United States. 

 The bank announced the move after a some two-hour unscheduled monetary policy meeting that followed rate cuts earlier in the day by several other central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. 
   TD The new repo rate - an indicator of lending trends - will take effect on Wednesday, according to a statement. The Riksbank also altered its deposit rate to 3 percent from 3.5 percent and its lending rate to 4.5 percent from 5 percent. 

 Sweden is one of three European Union countries that has not adopted the euro and so is not bound by the ECB's rate decision. 

 "The uncertainty occasioned by last week's act of terrorism creates the risk of a further dampening of global demand," the central bank said. 

 It said it is difficult in the present situation to assess the collective consequences for the international economy and thus inflation prospects in Sweden over the next few years. 

 "There is a risk that confidence in the future will decline in both the corporate sector and the household sector, which could result in a deeper and more prolonged economic slowdown," the bank said. 

 The last time the Riksbank moved rates was July 6, when it raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent following several unsuccessful interventions in the currency market to support a weak Swedish krona. 

 The repo rate is the interest received or paid by banks in a period of seven days.

 HD UPDATE 4-Bank of Canada chops key  interest rate .    BY By Irene Marushko    WC797 words   PD17 September 2001   ET23:23   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
   LP (Adds Paul Martin's comments in paragraphs 11,12; updates markets in paragraphs 13,14,15) 

 OTTAWA, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada took the extraordinary step on Monday of cutting rates between scheduled policy meetings, slashing its key interest rate by 50 basis points just an hour after the U.S. Federal Reserve made a similar move to boost economic confidence in the wake of last Tuesday's terror attacks in the United States. 
   TD The Bank of Canada surprised markets by lowering its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis points to 3.5 percent, the lowest it has been since November 1997 - bringing the bank rate to 3.75 percent. 

 It was the first time the bank has cut rates between meetings since moving to a schedule of preset dates earlier this year. The Bank's next scheduled date for announcing rate policy is Oct. 23. 

 The move copied the Fed's 50 basis point cut to the federal funds rate to 3.0 percent. The Fed's symbolic discount rate was also eased, to 2.5 percent from 3.0 percent. 

 The European Central Bank also echoed the Fed rate cut, lowering it benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 3.75 percent. 

 Major Canadian banks all cut their prime lending rates to 5.25 percent after the central bank's move. 

 The Bank of Canada said last week's attacks in the United States may pose "significant challenges" to confidence in North America and elsewhere. 

 "Accordingly, the bank is taking this action today to underpin confidence and provide further support for economic growth in Canada," it said in a statement. 

 ECONOMIC SHOCKWAVE EXPECTED 

 Analysts have expected an economic shockwave on stock and currency markets because of the devastating attacks by hijacked airliners on New York and the Pentagon, killing an estimated 5,000 people. 

 "With indications of greater weakness in the U.S., even before the terrorist strike last week, and then the uncertainty caused by the developments on Tuesday in the U.S., the bank just feels the downside risk to the Canadian economy has gotten too great," said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Bank of Montreal. 

 Finance Minister Paul Martin said the steep rate moves were not a sign of a bank panicked over the economy. 

 "What happened today in terms of the Fed and the Bank of Canada is essentially putting in place those measures to ensure that liquidity continues and that the system functions. They've done what they had to do," Martin told reporters. 

 The Canadian dollar demonstrated continued weakness, closing at C$1.5692 to the U.S. dollar, or 63.73 U.S. cents, down from C$1.5649, or 63.90 U.S. cents, on Friday. It had opened weaker at C$1.5700. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index closed slightly higher in volatile trading, with technology and consumer products issues lifting the market against a backdrop of steep declines in U.S. equities. The TSE 300 closed up 17.15 points, or 0.25 percent, at nearly 6,908.00 points. 

 Canadian bonds dropped sharply on Monday but foreign investors were still attracted to short-term issues in the wake of the falling Canadian dollar and interest rates. 

 NEED FOR "PROMPT ACTION" 

 "The bank's decision to act outside of its normal schedule of announcement dates reflects the need for prompt action to counteract potential effects on confidence in the aftermath of the extraordinary events in the United States," the central bank said. 

 Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge, who canceled his speech scheduled for Wednesday in New Brunswick, had said early this year that only extraordinary circumstances would merit an inter-meeting move. 

 Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns, said further cuts were likely for Canada, where the bank has steadily trimmed rates in light of a weakening U.S. economy. 

 Canada began the year with a bank rate of 6.00 percent, which has been trimmed throughout 2001 to keep the economy moving. Consumer confidence has remained robust. Inflation has been only a slight worry. 

 "I think the bank's move was quite appropriate and hopefully it will set us up to move forward as we go into the fourth quarter," said CIBC senior economist John Clinkard. 

 But he said the bank could sit on the sidelines in October because the cumulative cuts for the year are expected to provide sufficient stimulus to the economy. 

 Toronto-Dominion bank's economics department said the rates in both countries could be cut further by 50 basis points. 

 Analysts expect inflation to remain docile when Statistics Canada releases August figures on Tuesday.

 HD UPDATE 1-Nordic shares close up on techs, Telia surges.    BY By Patrick McLoughlin    WC668 words   PD17 September 2001   ET20:17   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
   LP STOCKHOLM, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Nordic techs and telecom shares closed in the black on a relief bounce on Monday in nervous trade after Wall Street re-opened lower after last week's terror attacks. 

 "It's a bit on relief, I guess, but it's very short money and it could soon turn the other way," said a Swedish dealer. 
   TD The Stoxx Nordic index reversed early losses to close up 1.7 percent, underperforming FTSE Eurotop 300 Index by 0.7 percentage points. 

 Nokia and Ericsson moved up strongly as investors rotated out of defensives into techs while Swedish telecom operator Telia jumped on a bullish outlook for its EBITDA margin. Airline SAS dived on the resignation of its board and a veiled warning on profits. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut, as widely expected, key interest rates by half a point - a move echoed by the European Central Bank - helped underpin sentiment, dealers said, and the tech-laden Nasdaq's initial fall was in line with expectations. 

 The late cutting by Sweden's central bank of its key repo rate to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent, five minutes before close of trade, also buoyed sentiment. 

 "The U.S. market is more or less what we thought it would be and the Fed rate cut helped so the Swedish OMX index is ahead," said one Stockholm trader. 

 "Every interest rate cut helps," said another dealer. "We are at such low levels in share prices it's not so easy to push the market lower." 

 NOKIA SURGES 

 Telecom equipment heavyweights led techs to higher ground, reversing earlier falls, with Finland's Nokia surging 4.8 percent and Swedish sector rival Ericsson up 3.2 percent to 38.30 crowns, after earlier hitting a session low of 35.80 crowns, the lowest the stock has been since October, 1998. 

 "There's strength in the growth stocks and weakness in the cyclicals in sector rotations which is why Ericsson and Nokia are up," said another broker. 

 "I think they were about to bottom out before what happened last week. That can be what holds this market up, if you have a drop, bargain hunters will come in on those big-cap names," said Enskilda Securities head of global trading Erik Einerth. 

 Telia surged 4.8 percent after the region's biggest telecoms operator said its underlying profit margin would grow to 25-30 percent by late 2002 or early 2003, and that it was selling loss-making units. 

 Airline SAS tumbled 9.7 percentafter its board resigned and its CEO warned anew on profits, while Danish drugs group Lundbeck plunged more than 21 percent after it announced the postponement of its Cipralex anti-depressant. 

 "Their chances of holding off generic competition until this follow-on drug is ready has just gone down substantially...a great deal of revenue rests on whether they can successfully delay entry of the generic product," said Jesse Schulman, at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co in London. 

 Surveying the overall trading pattern, some dealers said they were hoping that a so-called patriotic rally would develop later in the day on Wall Street which would help stabilise Nordic and European markets. 

 In the meantime dealers said many investors were staying on the sidelines. "Most people will try to keep their positions as small as possible," said Enskilda's Erik Einerth. 

 Earlier fund managers and equity strategists said that at current market levels the region's investors had already priced in fall of up to 10 percent from Wall Street with anything beyond that having an overflow impact on Nordic equities. 

 "With what we have seen happen in Europe and Asia today, there could be a 5-10 percent decline in the U.S... which I believe is largely discounted in Nordic markets already," said Danske Securities equity strategist Anders Borschenius.

 HD UPDATE 1-ECB's Liebscher - confidence-building successful.    BY By Christian Gutlederer    WC372 words   PD17 September 2001   ET19:13   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
   LP VIENNA, Sept 17 (Reuters) - European Central Bank board member Klaus Liebscher said on Monday he believed central banks had been largely successful in restoring confidence on financial markets after last week's terror attacks in the United States. 

 In a telephone interview with Reuters, he also expressed confidence in the resilience of U.S. financial markets after the devastating attacks. The European Central Bank on Monday joined the U.S. Federal Reserve with a surprise half a percentage interest rate cut to boost confidence following last week's attacks on New York and Washington. 
   TD The bank lowered its key minimum bid rate to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent. The Fed had earlier in the day also lowered its key lending rate by 50 basis points to three percent. 

 Liebscher, governor of the Austrian National Bank, said action by the world's central banks in the wake of the terror attacks, such as last week's provision of extra liquidity, had been intended to maintain confidence in the normal functioning of the financial system. 

 "I think that has largely succeeded so far," he said. 

 "We still have great confidence in the resilience of the U.S. system," he added. 

 Asked if the Federal Reserve had asked the ECB to cut its rates, Liebscher replied: "We have to make our own decisions." 

 But he added: "We are facing extraordinary circumstances and naturally if we see a softening tendency coinciding in America and Europe, then inflationary pressure falls. That is our measure for any changes in interest rates." 

 Liebscher said Monday's half-point ECB rate cut had been based on the bank's view that slower growth in the U.S. and Europe in the wake of the terror attacks would reduce inflationary pressures. 

 OPEC's announcement that it would ensure adequate oil supplies to avoid upward pressure on oil prices had been "absolutely positive." 

 "I also take the view that we should not talk of recession," Liebscher said. "There may possibly be a clear slowdown in growth. But as long as we have growth figures of 1.5 to 1.75 percent we are in growth, not in a recession."

 HD UPDATE 1-ECB joins Fed in surprise 50 bp rate cut.    WC570 words   PD17 September 2001   ET18:48   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
   LP FRANKFURT, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank on Monday joined the U.S. Federal Reserve with a surprise half a percentage point interest rate cut to boost confidence and support growth following last week's attacks on U.S. cities. 

 In what it said was a coordinated action with the Fed, the ECB said its key minimum bid rate was lowered to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent. The Fed had earlier in the day lowered its key lending rate, also by 50 basis points, to three percent. 
   TD "In the view of the Governing Council, the recent events in the U.S. are likely to weigh adversely on confidence in the euro area, reducing short-term outlook for domestic growth," the bank said in a statement following an unscheduled meeting of its governing council carried out via a telephone conference. 

 "As this is likely to further reduce inflationary risks in the euro area, a lowering of the ECB's key interest rates is appropriate," it said. 

 After the ECB cut, the Swiss National Bank also announced a 50 basis points cut in its key interest rate. Earlier in the day Canada's central bank had also cut by 50 bp. 

 The ECB's decision came as a surprise as just hours earlier its President Wim Duisenberg had signalled the bank would not rush into action. 

 "It is too early to come to a judgement of all the consequences (the attacks) will have on future economic growth, if any," he told a news conference in Helsinki. 

 Asked if the Fed's action was a warning about the European economy, he said: 

 "I can't see that as a warning sign for the euro zone economy." 

 TENDER CANCELLED 

 Also, the bank had earlier in the day announced a routine 14-day tender for the money market at the old 4.25 percent rate. It had to subsequently cancel the tender and set a new one at 3.75 percent. 

 Last week, Duisenberg and other ECB officials have said a rush decision to cut rates would be seen as panic. 

 Even though some in the financial markets had expected a coordinated action, the ECB's decision on Monday came out of the blue. 

 "It is surprising because Duisenberg today said there is no need to cut right now and especially from the economic point of view we think there was really no need to cut," said Volker Nitsch, an economist at Bankgesellschaft Berlin. 

 "But it is an emotional response and as they say it is totally related with what is happening in the U.S. I think it's okay they do it, but it was not necessary." 

 The ECB's surprise decision was a fresh shot in the arm for European equities markets, which had welcomed a coordinated effort by two of the world's top central banks to support the faltering global economy. 

 The FT Eurotop index was up 2.8 percent while the euro inched up from day lows to $0.9197. 

 ECB SAYS GROWTH TO REBOUND 

 The ECB said it had confidence in the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy and said European economic fundamentals remained healthy.

   LP AMSTERDAM, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The Dutch finance ministry said on Monday it had no comment on the European Central Bank's decision to cut its key interest rate by half a percentage point following last week's terror attacks on the United States. 

 "We don't comment on rate cuts, that's up to the ECB," a finance ministry spokesman said. 
   TD The ECB cut its key financing rate to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent in a move to make borrowing cheaper and support economic growth. The cut comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its key lending rate by 50 basis points on Monday. 

 The rate cuts were no reason for the ministry to change its economic growth projections, the spokesman said. On Tuesday, the Dutch government will present its budget for next year.

   LP SAO PAULO, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Brazil's benchmark stock index rose about 4 percent by noon on Monday on the back of a U.S. interest rate cut and growing hopes Wall Street could recover early losses, traders said. 

 The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa .BVSP) index rose to 10,441 in thin volume, before settling back to trade 3.3 percent firmer. Market heavyweights like phone company Telemar and state oil giant Petrobras led the market higher. 
   TD The Bovespa lost more than 18 percent last week to levels not seen since August 1999 on fears Tuesday's hijacked plane attacks in the U.S. would knock U.S. stock prices sharply lower and slow growth in the world's linchpin economy. 

 "I think, thank God, the worst has passed in the U.S. (stock markets)," said Indusval brokerage director trader John Carioba as U.S. stock indices recovered slightly from falls of more than 5 percent. 

 Players said the U.S. Federal Reserve's earlier announcement of a 50 basis points interest rate cut between scheduled policy meetings had also proved supportive.

   LP WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The United States, still counting bodies from last week's attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, prepared for a long, hard war on Monday, as the financial world braced for a rocky day as Wall Street came back on line after a four-day shutdown. 

 Just before the markets reopened, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point, to bolster confidence and keep markets functioning. 
   TD With Washington's war talk fueling uncertainty and fears of a global recession growing, traders were prepared for sharp declines as the New York Stock Exchange resumed trading, only a few blocks from the still-smoking rubble of the World Trade Center's 110-story twin towers where thousands of bodies remain to be recovered. 

 The latest toll is 4,957, with 190 people confirmed dead. Another 188 died at the Pentagon and 45 in the crash of a hijacked plane in Pennsylvania. 

 A Reuters/Zogby poll found 71 percent of American voters were ready to see the United States go to war against countries which "harbor or aid terrorists" even if it meant suffering substantial U.S. casualties; 21 percent were opposed. 

 The White House has vowed retaliation by a "mighty giant" for last Tuesday's attacks in which 19 Arab militants hijacked four commercial planes, crashing two of them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and a third into the Pentagon. The fourth crashed in Pennsylvania after a struggle between passengers and the hijackers. 

 President George W. Bush has said Islamic zealot Osama bin Laden was the prime suspect. The Saudi-born multi-millionaire is based in Afghanistan under the protection of the radical Islamic Taliban government. 

 SCUD MISSILES MOVED 

 In Afghanistan, Taliban rulers moved a large arsenal of weapons including Russian Scud missiles to positions near the border with Pakistan, as tens of thousands of people fearing a U.S. attack, fled several major cities and headed for the borders with Pakistan and Iran. 

 As part of its strategy, the White House is considering lifting an executive order banning U.S. involvement in overseas assassinations and Vice President Dick Cheney said the CIA may once again be allowed to recruit agents to conduct "the mean, nasty, dirty, dangerous business" of spying on extremists. 

 While Washington rattled its saber, a delegation from Pakistan sent a delegation to Afghanistan to press the ruling Taliban to hand over bin Laden. 

 Speaking as the delegation arrived in Afghanistan, Pakistan's Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said Taliban leaders should consider the consequences of not cooperating with the U.S. hunt for bin Laden. 

 "The delegation is motivating and advising (Taliban leader) Mullah Omar and the Taliban leadership that they should consider the pros and cons of not cooperating with America and others on matters of terrorism because if Afghanistan does not do the logical, balanced attitude in this regard it will be a problem for Afghanistan and its people," he said. 

 As Bush rallied a global coalition for war against the "barbarians" who staged the attacks, the president heard encouraging sounds of support from European allies but also heard some notes of caution. 

 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, pointing the finger at bin Laden and saying he must be stopped, made a grim comparison. "For many people of my generation or older this is perhaps potentially the most frightening situation since the Cuban missile crisis in the early 1960s," he told BBC radio. 

 ON WALL STREET, GRIEF MATCHED BY RESOLVE 

 The cost of the attacks will be colossal and with investors holding their breath for Wall Street to open, the government signaled it was ready to provide economic props to try and keep the United States from sliding deeper into a downturn. 

 The grief of mourning Wall Street financiers was matched by their resolve to get back to business as usual. 

 Just three blocks southeast of where the towers collapsed, a giant U.S. flag fluttered above the entrance to the New York Stock Exchange ready for the thousands of people expected to return on Monday morning for the opening bell. 

 "You're damn right the firm is going to come back," said David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of America's powerful brokerage Merrill Lynch and Co. "This place did not get to be what it is by having a bunch of pussycats here." 

 The NYSE, the world's largest stock exchange, has been closed, along with other New York financial markets, since Tuesday, the longest shutdown since the Great Depression. 

 In a symbolically charged ceremony, representatives of New York's police and fire departments will ring the NYSE's opening bell at 9:33 a.m. EDT (1333 GMT) after two minutes of silence to honor the victims and the singing of "God Bless America." 

 Asian shares fell in pre-Wall Street nervousness that saw Japan's Nikkei share index drop five percent to a 17-year low of 9,504.41 points. The Eurotop 300 index of top European blue chips, was down 1.7 percent but off three-year lows. 

 Concerted efforts by the U.S. market watchdog, the Federal Reserve, high-profile financial figures and leading companies could cushion Wall Street from any massive, opening sell-off, but traders expected a rocky start. There was, however, some talk of a possible "patriotic rally." 

 CHILLING SEARCH, POIGNANT MOMENTS 

 Rescue workers labored for a seventh day over the ruins of the towers in the heart of New York's financial district, but prospects dimmed that any of the nearly 4,957 people now listed as missing in the concrete and steel sarcophagus survived. 

 In a chilling discovery, the body of a male air crew member was found bound hand and foot, a police source said. Earlier, the body of a flight attendant was found with her hands bound. 

 Away from the site, thousands of posters of those missing covered bus shelters, telephone booths and subway walls. 

 One, poignant in its simplicity, read: "Have you seen my Daddy? Jason Jacobs." It carried a telephone number and a photograph of a smiling toddler playing with her father. 

 In the most recent count, 190 people were confirmed dead, including 37 firefighters and rescue workers. 

 More than 300 firefighters and emergency service workers are among the missing. "The worst part is when you come across bunker gear, and you know you've got a firefighter. It's horrendous," firefighter Joseph Tustin said. 

 The FBI has 4,000 agents tracking 40,000 leads. 

 U.S. officials said two more "material witnesses" had been taken into custody, joining two others already detained. 

 A further 25 people were taken into custody on alleged immigration violations and were being questioned. The FBI was seeking more than 100 others for questioning. 

 Investigators hoped the arrests and detentions would eventually lead them to the man the White House said with growing conviction was their prime suspect - bin Laden.

 HDCentral banks act to soften the economic blow.   BYBy GERARD BAKER IN WASHINGTON, ED CROOKS IN LONDON AND TONY MAJOR IN FRANKFURT.    WC788 words   PD17 September 2001   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2001 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPThe world's central banks and financial regulators have been in constant contact over the weekend to discuss emergency measures to prevent last week's human catastrophe turning into a financial and economic disaster.

Although there have been no signs yet of serious problems appearing in the international financial system, fears are running high that last week's attacks will trigger a US and perhaps even a global recession.
   TDStill emotionally battered from the events so close to home last Tuesday, many Wall Street economists marked down their forecasts for US growth.

"The immediate consequences are obvious: US Q3 gross domestic product will contract; short-term interest rates will be lower around the globe; and financial markets will experience heightened volatility," was the view of James Glassman, US economist at JP Morgan Chase.

Despite rumours of liquidity problems in various institutions, regulators said that the international financial system was functioning well, with no serious difficulties in functions such as payment and clearing being reported.

The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, last week between them supplied about $300bn (roughly GBP200bn) in liquidity to financial system by buying financial assets from banks and other institutions in the money markets.

The Fed and the ECB also arranged a $50bn swap facility, to enable the ECB to provide dollars to any eurozone banks that might be experiencing liquidity problems.

ECB officials said the bank injected the funds to prevent money market rates increasing because of liquidity constraints that arose as participants withheld funds from the market amid fears that the financial system might not function smoothly after the terrorist attacks.

"Those fears had been overcome by the end of last week. There is now a huge amount of liquidity in the system," said one official.

ECB council members insisted over the weekend that the damage and disruption caused by last week's attacks did not pose a threat to financial stability.

Ernst Welteke, the president of the Bundesbank and a council member of the ECB said in a newspaper interview yesterday: "Through the swift reaction of the central banks, it did not evolve into a widespread fire. One can count on that for the future as well. I am confident that the domestic economic damage will be limited."

But ECB officials declined to comment on the possibility of a joint round of interest rate cuts by the ECB, the Fed and other central banks.

Matti Vanhala, the governor of the Bank of Finland and another ECB council member, said it was unclear whether the attacks would cause a big change to what the bank already believed would be a slow US recovery. "We need more information about the impact of the attacks. But it is not clear that this will indicate the need for a co-ordinated move," he added.

However, analysts and traders now believe the ECB is now very likely to cut rates again before the end of the year.

Futures market rates are pricing in a reduction of 0.5 percentage points to 3.75 per cent for the ECB's main interest rate by the end of the year.

And although governments and central bankers have been playing down the idea of a rate cut co-ordinated between Europe and the US - Sir Edward George, governor of the Bank of England, called it "extremely unlikely" - there are a number of interest rate decisions coming up in quick succession that would allow several central banks to cut rates within days of each other.

The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is on October 2, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee takes its next decision on October 4, and the ECB has governing council meetings on September 27 and October 11.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to pre-empt that next FOMC meeting and cut interest rates as early as this week, to bolster investors' confidence as the stock markets re-open.

Economists believe the fed funds rate, the key interbank lending rate, could fall to 2.75 per cent or even lower in the next few months as the Fed adds new urgency to its nine-month long campaign to bolster the flagging economy.

In addition, the response of the US Congress to the terrorist assaults suggests fiscal policy will be significantly loosened over the coming months. Lawmakers have already approved an outline $40bn for repair and rebuilding efforts and will almost certainly allocate more to increase the nation's defence capabilities.

To some economists this suggests the rebound they now expect to begin next year could be a lively one.

 CLMCredit Markets   HD U.S. Stock Market's Performance Will Be Key to Fate of Treasurys    BY By Jennifer Downey    CRDow Jones Newswires   WC995 words   PD17 September 2001   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC8   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
   LP NEW YORK -- The direction in Treasurys this week will hinge more than ever on the performance of the U.S. stock market, which reopens today after a four-day closure and an enormous crisis of national confidence. 

 Economic data this week, including the Federal Reserve's snapshot of the economy -- the beige book -- as well as the August consumer price index, will be pictures from the past, analysts say, and markets will look instead to the Fed's immediate operations for leadership and liquidity. 
   TD Meanwhile, the infrastructure of the fixed-income market will remain severely compromised due to the devastation that the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center brought to downtown Manhattan and to the trading operations of many Wall Street banks. 

 "Market conditions are still going to be very, very thin, assuming institutional investors and money managers rally around the flag," said Brian Robinson, analyst at the market research firm 4Cast in New York. 

 If stocks indeed hold up today, Treasury prices will head lower, analysts said. But traders will need to see several days of stock performance to gauge the "sustainability of direction," Mr. Robinson said. 

 But after European stock markets closed from 5% to 7% lower on Friday, "it's going to be tough" for U.S. stocks, said Ifty Islam, fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York. 

 And with the supply outlook for Treasurys "worsening day by day," Mr. Islam expects the government bond yield curve will continue to steepen. 

 The spread between the two-year and 30-year bond has already widened greatly over the shortened sessions of Treasury trading last week. Friday afternoon, the spread was at 2.48 percentage points compared with 1.93 percentage points on Monday. 

 The strong flight-to-quality sentiment that sent prices surging Friday was already in place before industrial production data for August were released. The data showed the decline in output fell by 0.8% for the month after slowing its descent in July. Economists expected a 0.4% decline. 

 Among other data released Friday, August producer prices rose by 0.4%, but fell by 0.1% excluding food and energy. The lack of visible price pressure means that inflation isn't a major concern for the Fed at this stage. 

 Treasurys trading ended early Friday. At the 2 p.m. EDT market close, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note's price was up 22/32 point, or $6.88 per $1,000 invested, at 103 15/32. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.553% from 4.639% Thursday, the first day of official trading following the terrorist attacks. 

 The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 19/32 point at 100 7/32 to yield 5.356%, down from 5.396% Thursday. 

 The two-year note yield dropped to 2.86% from 2.98% Thursday. Friday's level was the lowest in the 29 years since the government began regularly auctioning that maturity. 

 In three consecutive days, the Fed injected an unprecedented amount of liquidity into markets through system repurchase agreements, concluding with a record $81.25 billion addition on Friday, all part of an effort to keep markets running smoothly following the terrorist attacks. 

 Friday's data were supportive of predictions for more Fed rate cuts, but expectations were already high that the Fed will make an intermeeting interest-rate cut this week in response to fundamental market stresses caused by the disaster. 

 The Fed's next move may be in concert with major central banks abroad, and may come as early as the U.S. stock market opening today, several analysts suggested. 

 Deutsche's Mr. Islam expects a half-point cut shortly after the markets open, while 4Cast's Mr. Robinson expects a quarter-point cut within a few days of the market open. 

 The outlook for stocks becomes even more uncertain, however, if direction from the Fed doesn't arrive right away, some said. And in the potentially volatile market environment once the New York Stock Exchange reopens today "there's a temptation for investors to try to do the contrarian trade," Mr. Islam said, though he added that the least risky bet is to trade along with consensus. 

 Yet, even after the shock that investors experienced last week, there are analysts who believe that the relative values of bonds and stocks have gone so far out of line that there is the potential for bonds to fall this week. 

 Even before the price gains in bonds following Tuesday's attacks, Treasurys were overvalued and stocks "severely undersold," said John Blough, president and CEO of Bond Watch Inc. in Sellersville, Pa. 

 "I think that the flight to quality in the two-year [note] is a great selling opportunity for those who've been long," he said. 

 And beyond the short-term potential for gains, the renewed commitment of citizens to helping the U.S. economy succeed could ultimately bring a turnaround, Mr. Blough said. 

 "You can't quantify the patriotism coming out right now," he said. "This could mark a watershed low for equity markets as well as the economy."

 Friday's Market Activity 

 A $5 billion two-year note auction by Freddie Mac found good demand as investors continued to flock to highly rated short-term securities. 

 Securities of Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored enterprise, are rated triple-A. 

 The bid-to-cover ratio for the Internet-based auction, or the dollar amount of bids received compared with the amount of securities available, was 3.69. That was the highest ever for a reference note auction and well above the average of 3.15. 

 Louise Herrle, vice president and treasurer for Freddie Mac, said the decision to sell the securities Friday, rather than wait until next week, was "to give the market something to focus on."
