   LPSTOCKS MARCHED ahead to a third consecutive session of gains as investors breathed a sigh of relief following the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose another 44.85 points, or 0.43%, to 10596.79. It still is down 186.22 points, or 1.7%, since the year began, but it has recovered 169.59 points in the past three trading days.
   TDInvestors did get some bad news after regular trading hours, as Amazon.com announced disappointing quarterly profit. Its stock fell 15% in after-hours trading.

As expected, the Fed raised its target rate for overnight bank lending by another quarter point, to 2.5%, its sixth such move since June. Investors already are predicting a similar rate increase when policy makers meet next month.

What the markets feared was the Fed's statement that accompanies its rate decision. Minutes of the previous Fed meeting, in December, indicated that some Fed decision makers were worrying about incipient inflation. Investors feared this could be reflected in the Fed statement, suggesting that the central bank was going to fight inflation by raising interest rates more rapidly. That would throw a wet blanket on the economy, hurting stocks and bonds.

To the market's relief, the Fed's statement yesterday was almost identical to others it has released recently. It said that "underlying inflation" is "expected to be relatively low," and indicated that Fed interest-rate increases can continue to be "measured."

"It was a carbon copy of past statements, and there was a very muted reaction," said David Briggs, head of stock trading at Pittsburgh mutual-fund group Federated Investors. "The good news is that the economy is growing rapidly and inflation doesn't seem to be a big problem."

But, reflecting widespread hesitancy among professional investors now, he said he wants to see more than a three-day rally before he is persuaded that the January slump is over.

Oil prices fell again, giving stocks additional support. Gold and the dollar both rose.

After the Fed announcement, a variety of banking companies, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia, quickly raised their prime lending rates, which are the base rates for many corporate and consumer loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%. (The Wall Street Journal's official published rate also changed to 5.5%, effective with today's Money Rates table.)

But Treasury-bond yields were little changed after the Fed announcement, because the news was widely anticipated. That means that rates for loans pegged to Treasury yields, including many fixed-rate mortgages, would be little affected.

The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.32%, or 3.78 points, to 1193.19, down 1.6% this year. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.31%, or 6.36 points, to 2075.06, down 4.6% for 2005.

Investors now will be biting their nails over the January employment report, due tomorrow, which is widely followed as an indicator of the economy's strength.

Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.51%, or 0.87 point, to 171.17.

In major U.S. market action:

Bonds were mixed and stocks advanced. The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield up to 4.145%. The 30-year bond was up 9/32 to yield 4.581%.

The dollar strengthened. Late in New York, it traded at 103.71 yen, up from 103.67, while the euro fell against the dollar to $1.3035 from $1.3046.

 CLMCredit Markets   HDYield Curve Flattens After  Interest-Rate  Move --- Fed Statement Convinces Traders That Long End Of Market Is Safest Place   BYBy Agnes T. Crane Dow Jones Newswires    WC715 words   PD3 February 2005   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC6   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPNEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase gave the Treasury market the green light to pursue its favorite activity: flattening the yield curve.

This trade favors longer-dated Treasurys such as the 10-year note and the 30-year bond over shorter-dated peers, which are more vulnerable to tighter monetary policy.
   TDThe Fed's quarter-point increase in the federal-funds target rate sent shorter-dated Treasurys lower by the end of active trade, but investor preference for longer-dated securities pushed the 30-year bond into positive territory.

Yield on the long bond exited active trade at 4.581%, its lowest closing level since July 2, 2003. Yields move inversely to prices.

The similar wording of the statement accompanying the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to increase its federal-funds target to 2.5% enhances the popularity of the curve-flattener trade that has ruled Treasurys for months.

Not only did the FOMC retain the "measured pace" language used to convey its intention to raise rates gradually, but the February statement was nearly identical to the one released at its last meeting in December.

For traders, that meant the long end of the market still is the safest place to park funds. Longer-dated securities are more sensitive to the corrosive effects of inflation.

At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 2/32, or $0.625 for each $1,000 invested, at 100 27/32. Its yield stood at 4.145% from 4.140% Tuesday. The 30-year bond's price was up 9/32 point at 112.

After the Fed announcement, some banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia, raised prime lending rates, the base rates for many corporate and consumer loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%.

Although many market participants had expected the Fed to stick with its measured outlook on rates, some feared the minutes from the December meeting released last month pointed to an emerging hawkish tone from the central bankers. "The FOMC statement was more benign than some investors feared," said Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at AIG Sun America Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J.

Glenn Haberbush, economist at Mizuho Securities in Hoboken, N.J., said additional quarter-point increases "are to be expected at the March 22 and May 3 FOMC meetings."

With the FOMC meeting over, investors now turn to the other two big events on the calendar: the monthly employment report scheduled for release tomorrow and the bulge of new supply coming down the pipeline next week. A tally of 200,000 new jobs is forecast for January. The average monthly payroll increase for the past 12 months has been 186,000, solid but not enough to push long-dated Treasury yields sharply higher.

The Treasury Department announced earlier yesterday it will sell $51 billion of new securities in its quarterly refunding next week to refund $11.44 billion in maturing issues and raise $39.56 billion. The refunding will comprise $22 billion three-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2008, to be sold Feb. 8; $15 billion of five-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2010, to be sold Feb. 9; and $14 billion of 10-year bonds maturing Feb. 15, 2015, to be sold Feb. 10.

Foreign Bonds

In a pre-emptive move that could affect the outcome of Argentina's $103 billion debt-restructuring offer, Standard &Poor's Ratings Services signaled it would raise the country's debt ratings after it completes its global bond exchange.

S&P "expects to assign its `B-' foreign and local-currency-issuer credit ratings to the Republic of Argentina following the financial close of the current debt rescheduling exercise," the ratings service said.

The upgrade would take Argentina out of "SD," or selective default, a rating it has carried since December 2001, and assign it a speculative-grade rating that assumes a low risk of a default within 12 months.

 HDMajor Events To Help Clarify Dollar's Outlook --- Currency's Crucial Week To Include Rate Decision, Bush Address, G-7 Meeting     BYBy Craig Karmin     WC685 words   PD3 February 2005   SNThe Asian Wall Street Journal   SCAWSJ   PGA1   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. To see the edition in which this article appeared, click here  http://awsj.com.hk/factiva-ns
   LPExpect some serious bang for the buck in the next few days, an event-filled stretch for the foreign-exchange market.  

First, the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy committee was expected to raise its key federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point yesterday -- bringing the target to 2.5% -- and currency traders will be looking for any hints that the Fed is stepping up the pace of future interest-rate moves. Then, U.S. President George W. Bush will deliver his State of the Union address, and investors will be watching to see whether he explains his plan for cutting the nation's budget deficit, which -- along with the trade gap -- has been a drag on the dollar.  
   TDU.S. employment numbers are to be released tomorrow, and the Group of Seven finance officials are to meet that day and Saturday. "There hasn't been a week like this for the past six to nine months, maybe longer," says John Taylor, chief investment officer for FX Concepts, a New York-based hedge fund. "I think we'll see a lot of reasons this week for the dollar to go up."  

Many analysts still believe the dollar is rutted in a longer-term bear market that could last for years. But the view that the U.S. currency can extend its recent gains, especially against the European currencies, is becoming more widespread.  

Last month, as the market's focus turned to the growing gap between U.S. and European short-term rates and superior U.S. economic prospects, the dollar edged higher against the euro and yen. This week's events and data are expected to help clarify whether these dollar-friendly trends are likely to continue.  

Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, says the dollar's most important ally right now is the Fed. "The interest-rate backdrop is now positive for the foreseeable future," he says.  

While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates to 2.5% from 2.25%, the market will be examining the Fed's accompanying statement to see whether officials continue to believe in raising rates at a "measured" pace.  

Tomorrow's U.S. nonfarm-payroll figures also will be watched closely. Adnan Akant, a managing director at Fischer Francis Trees & Watts Inc., a New York money-management firm, says this number is critical because the Fed and G-7 officials often gear their global outlooks to the strength of the U.S. economy.  

A better-than-expected payroll figure would be positive for the dollar, while a disappointing number could cause a selloff. But unless the payroll figure is so bad that it raises doubts about the Fed's determination to tighten monetary policy, it won't be critical to the dollar, Mr. Shepherdson suggests.  

State of the Union addresses often aren't crucial events for the currency market, but some think that this year has the potential to be different. The widening budget deficit has been a major drag on the dollar, and skepticism about the Bush administration's ability to curb the deficit is one reason analysts remain long-term bearish on the currency.  

Expectations are limited heading into the G-7 meeting. Conflicting statements from Chinese officials about the yuan, which is pegged to the dollar, alternately dashed and raised hopes last week that China was moving closer to a revaluation. Any revaluation by China is expected to boost the yuan, and other Asian currencies in the short run as it would allow their currencies to appreciate without losing a competitive edge to China.  

Many analysts now think that whatever the G-7 may declare about the need for China and other Asian countries to allow their currencies to strengthen in an effort to restore more balance to the global economy, Beijing is unlikely to move on its currency and appear it is giving in to foreign pressure.

 HDFed nudges up interest rates, trying to keep inflation in check     BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER     CRAP Economics Writer   WC816 words   PD3 February 2005   ET19:23   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - It's six down and seven to go. Or maybe only three more interest-rate increases, depending on which forecaster you talk to.  

While there was a great deal of unanimity among economists concerning the Fed's first six increases, there is a split over how much higher Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues will drive rates in their quest to find neutral. That is the point where interest rates are neither stimulating the economy nor slowing it down.  
   TDThe Fed on Wednesday raised the target for the federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 2.5 percent. It was the sixth such increase since last summer. The rate is the interest that banks charge each other and is the Fed's main lever for influencing economic activity.  

Banks' prime lending rate, which moves in lockstep with the federal funds rate, rose another quarter point with Wednesday's Fed rate increase, to 5.5 percent. While the prime rate, used for many short-term consumer and business loans, is up from a 46-year low of 4 percent, it still is at an attractive level for borrowers.  

The federal funds rate is more than double the 1 percent funds rate in effect before the Fed started tightening rates last June, but 2.5 percent is still low by historical standards.  

Given the low level at which the Fed started raising interest rates, the increases haven't begun to pinch borrowers very much.  

And long-term rates, which are influenced by Fed actions but set by markets, have actually been trending lower over the past eight months.  

Rates on 30-year mortgages fell for a fifth straight week this week to 5.63 percent, according to a Freddie Mac survey released Thursday, lower than the 6.25 percent level where they were before the Fed began raising rates eight months ago.  

For the year, analysts believe that 30-year mortgages will probably rise by about 1 percentage point to around 6.5 percent by December, an increase that likely will trim sales of both new and existing homes by about 3 percent this year. Such a reduction would follow four consecutive years of record sales levels for both new and existing homes.  

Some economists believe that three more rate hikes by the Fed, pushing the federal funds rate to 3.25 percent, will accomplish the goal of the rate neither stimulating the economy nor slowing it down.  

But other analysts are forecasting that the Fed will keep up its credit tightening for the entire year, until the funds rate hits 4.25 percent in December.  

Economists said there was nothing in a brief statement released after the Fed's two-day meeting to suggest that policy-makers will either speed up or slow down their rate-raising campaign.  

"All the stars seem to be aligned to support a gradualist approach," said Anthony Chan, senior economist at JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management.  

The Fed said the economy is growing "at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually." Inflation, the Fed said, remains "well contained."  

On Wall Street, the Fed's action helped boost stocks on Wednesday but stocks lost ground Thursday after a report showed productivity rose by just 0.8 percent in the final three months of last year, the slowest pace in nearly four years. Investors worried that the Fed may become more concerned about inflation if productivity gains begin to slow.  

Short-term rates, which are linked to the Fed actions, will likely move up more this year.  

"Borrowing costs are still very low relative to historic norms ... but the next six rate hikes will be more significant to borrowers than the first six," said Greg McBride, an analyst with Bankrate.com.  

Some analysts are predicting the Fed will raise rates at its March, May and possibly June meetings, pushing the funds rate to 3 percent or 3.25 percent, but then take a breather.  

"If the economy does start to cool off in the second half of the year, the Fed would be able to react on a trial and error basis," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.  

Steve Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said he was looking for quarter-point moves at the next seven Fed meetings.  

But Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, said he believed the Fed will pause when the funds rate gets to around 3.5 percent.  

"There is enough uncertainty about where the neutral level is that they will feel comfortable stopping to see how the economy is performing and whether they need to raise rates further," he said.

 HDUPDATE 2-Rate futures traders resigned to more Fed hikes.      BYBy Ros Krasny      WC489 words   PD2 February 2005   ET22:47   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005 Reuters Limited   
   LPCHICAGO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. interest rate futures traders were relieved on Wednesday that the Federal Reserve did not take a hawkish turn on monetary policy, but still expect rate increases to persist into at least mid-year.   

Futures bounced briefly when the Federal Open Market Committee left its comments largely unchanged after a two-day meeting, but sagged as prospects for more rate hikes sank in.   
   TDBy making its sixth rate increase since June and hinting at more to come, the Fed "continued to kick the can down the road," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin Kubik Stephens & Thompson.   

Wednesday's move pushed the Federal funds rate - the cost of loans between banks - to 2.50 percent from a decades-low 1.0 percent last June.   

Rate futures price 25 basis point increases from the March 22 and May 3 FOMC meetings, which would take the Fed funds rate to 3.00 percent.   

Chances of an increase in June rose to about 61 percent from 56 percent at Tuesday's close. Eurodollar futures imply an end-of-year Fed funds rate of about 3.54 percent.   

Analysts said evidence that the Fed's tightening has not dampened the economy adds to prospects of an unrelenting string of rate hikes.   

The Fed wants to move rates to a "neutral" level that neither blunts growth nor fosters inflation. Economists see that rate as somewhere between 3 percent and 4.5 percent.   

"Higher rates are not affecting the companies we're dealing with because they are still relatively low," said Bill Zadrozny, president of Siemens Financial Services in Iselin, New Jersey, a commercial financing company.   

"Eventually - perhaps at 4 percent or so - the Fed's policy will have some teeth," Zadrozny said.   

Reports such as the Conference Board's strong January consumer confidence reading have hinted at an improving economic outlook and faster pace of hiring.   

"We continue to worry that the Fed is behind the curve and believe the market is underestimating how high the fed funds rate will be lifted," Wesbury said.   

Before this week's meeting, dealers had worried that the Fed might hint at a faster pace of rate moves by removing its comment that low underlying inflation allows a "measured" removal of accommodative policy.   

Minutes from the central bank's December meeting noted that some members were worried about potential excessive speculation in financial markets caused by years of low rates.   

"Fears that the December minutes represented a softening-up exercise, after which the Fed would take a more aggressive stance in the post-meeting statement, proved unfounded," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.   

Still, some dealers wondered if the Fed was merely holding back on a change in tactics until Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies to Congress about the economy on Feb. 16 and 17.

   LPNEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter point to 2.50 percent - matching market forecasts - in its sixth consecutive interest rate increase.   

Major U.S. stock indexes were litle moved by the announcement.   
   TDFollowing are comments from equity market analysts and strategists on the Fed's decision:   

NEIL MASSA, SENIOR TRADER AT JOHN HANCOCK FUNDS:   

"The Fed's comment about keeping the measured pace of interest rate hike was what we were hoping for. There will be a positive bias in the market today. If there is any change in the Fed's outlook it will be noted in Greenspan's testimony in two weeks, so that will be the next big thing to watch."   

JOHN CALDWELL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT MCDONALD FINANCIAL GROUP:   

"This is a market that wants to remain comfortable with its forecast for the Fed to raise 25 basis points at a time, raising the rate to somewhere around 3.5 percent.   

"Because the statement is very much in line with what people were hoping to see, I don't think it will have any great impact (on the market). This keeps us on the same trajectory, a steady series of 25 basis-point increases throughout the first half of this year, at least."   

JEFFREY SAUT, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL:   

"Is it real or is it memorex? It sounds like the same thing we heard at the last meeting. The language sounds exactly the same.   

"The problem I think the Fed has is it would like to raise short term interest rates and have the economy healthy enough for long term rates to back up with them - but that's not happening.   

"The real news here is the flattening of the yield curve. Historically, that has not been a real positive thing for strong economic growth."   

ART NUNES - MARKET STRATEGIST, IMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, SEATTLE:   

"If investors focus on the latest rate hikes and worry about inflation, then the correction that the stock market has been in for the past few weeks will continue for some time. If they focus on the positive, and that is a stronger economy, then that is definitely going to be positive looking out over the next six to nine months."   

ANTHONY CHAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN FLEMING ASSET MANAGEMENT:   

"The Fed is still saying they are going to raise rates at measured pace. The Fed believes that there is unfinished business moving forward. But it is their view that just because there is unfinished business, it doesn't mean it has be completed in a day. I don't believe they are going to change to a more aggressive stance any time in the near future."

ANTHONY CHAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN FLEMING ASSET MANAGEMENT:   

"The Fed is still saying they are going to raise rates at measured pace. The Fed believes that there is unfinished business moving forward. But it is their view that just because there is unfinished business, it doesn't mean it has be completed in a day. I don't believe they are going to change to a more aggressive stance any time in the near future."

 CLMTuesday's Markets   HDStocks Climb, Helped by Decline in Oil Prices   BYBy E.S. Browning    WC467 words   PD2 February 2005   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPAFTER SLUMPING in January, stocks greeted February with a smile.

Following upbeat economic and corporate news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday rose 62.00 points, or 0.59%, to 10551.94, still down 2.1% for 2005.
   TDOrdinarily, February is worse for stocks than is January. Since the Dow industrials' first full year in 1897, the average has advanced in February only about half the time. It is one of the rare months whose average performance is a small decline. The average typically shows a gain in January, although it didn't this year.

Many investors expect the market to improve now. They consider the early-year slump a pause after the strong upswing late last year.

"There was an excessive stock runup in late 2004. We borrowed some returns from this year," said Marc Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust. "And there were concerns about the Iraq election that couldn't be eliminated in one day."

In addition, investors welcomed yesterday's decline in oil prices, which fell $1.08 to $47.12 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. And December construction spending jumped, as did January manufacturing employment.

Gains were limited, however, by a disappointing level of manufacturing activity in January. On top of that, the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy meeting winds up today with what is expected to be another quarter-point boost in the target short-term lending rate, to 2.5%.

Investors are nervous about whether the Fed, which is beginning to worry about inflation, will continue to promise a measured pace for future rate increases.

The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.30%, or 6.29 points, to 2068.70, leaving it down 4.9% this year. The broad Standard &Poor's 500-stock index advanced 0.69%, or 8.14 points, to 1189.41, still off 1.9% this year.

Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.19%, or 0.32 point, to 170.30.

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.67 billion shares traded, 2,263 stocks rose and 1,042 fell.

Bonds declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield up to 4.140%, as yields and prices move inversely. The 30-year bond was down 6/32 to yield 4.597%.

The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it strengthened to 103.67 yen, from 103.63 yen Monday, while the euro strengthened against the dollar to $1.3046 from $1.3035.

   LP[Today's Market Forecast]

If a Tree Falls . . .
   TDThe pace at which the Federal Reserve has been raising rates has become so rote that today's decision is being viewed as a near nonevent.

Quarter-point rise by quarter-point rise, meeting by meeting -- why should today be any different? Economists and market participants alike expect that Fed policy makers will lift the overnight bank-lending target rate to 2.5% from 2.25%, making it their sixth rate increase in as many meetings.

The metronomic regularity of the increases lends support to the sense that all the Federal Reserve is really doing now is reversing what had been excessively low rates, moving back to some neutral level. This contrasts with the Fed's usual impetus behind raising rates: cooling a too-hot economy.

This may be part of why the market's response to the Fed's moves has been limited. Short-term rates, which the Fed most directly influences, have risen as the central bank began to tighten the monetary screws. But since the Fed pushed its target rate up from 1% -- a 40-year low -- in June, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has dropped, to 4.14% from 4.70%.

This stands in contrast to the past four tightening cycles, when, according to Lehman Brothers, the yield on the 10-year had risen by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points.

The drop in the 10-year yield may be partly due to Asian central banks buying Treasurys in order to keep the dollar strong against their currencies. That said, the Treasury arena isn't the only place where investors are reacting atypically to the Fed.

The stock market has risen since the Fed started raising rates. Yields on corporate bonds, particularly those rated as speculative, have come down. Couple these things with a drop in the dollar and lower mortgage rates, and the economy is probably getting nearly as much punch as it did before the Fed started moving the punch bowl away.

But if the Fed policy makers' goal really is to take away an overly accommodative interest-rate policy, wouldn't they also like the economy in general to have less wind at its back? Maybe the Fed will keep banging out rate increases until the market responds.

   LPUS Treasury bond prices fell, sending yields higher, as the market awaited an expected interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve. Investors anticipate the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point to 2.5 per cent. The market will be looking out for signs of more hawkish language following recent strong economic data. Analysts said investors were also looking ahead to fourth-quarter productivity growth data due on Thursday. A slowdown in productivity could push up unit labour costs and with that, lift broader inflation. By late morning in New York, two-year notes yielded 3.296 per cent, up 0.8 basis points, while 10-year yields rose 1.3bp to 4.157 per cent. There was limited reaction to the Treasury's quarterly borrowing plans, which were as expected. Eurozone government bond yields also rose. The European Central Bank is due to pronounce on interest rates on Thursday.
   TDThe interest rate sensitive two-year Schatz yield was up 2.8 basis points at 2.415 per cent while the 10-year Bund yield was 1.9bp firmer at 3.552 per cent. In the UK, gilt prices were little changed, with investors shrugging off a sale of index-linked gilts that found plenty of bidders. The two-year gilt yield rose 0.7bp at 4.469 per cent, while the 10-year yield also edged 0.2bp higher to 4.591 per cent. In Japan, 20-year bond prices rose, sending yields to their lowest since March last year, on speculation that fund managers who use the Nomura Bond Performance Index as a benchmark will speed up their purchases before the index is extended in March. The 20-year JGB rose 0.726 to 101.442, sending its yield down 5 basis points to 1.90 per cent. The 10-year JGB yield fell 2.5bp to 1.27 per cent, also the lowest since last March.

 HDFed raises key  interest rate  for sixth time     BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER     CRAP Economics Writer   WC639 words   PD2 February 2005   ET20:51   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the sixth time since last June as policy-makers continued their efforts to make sure a strengthening economy does not trigger unwanted inflation.  

The Fed announced that it was raising its target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, by a quarter-point to 2.5 percent. Before the Fed began tightening credit last June, the funds rate had been at a 46-year low of 1 percent.  
   TDThe February increase is not expected to be the last. Analysts think the Fed will push the funds rate up in quarter-point increments through most of this year.  

That would mean higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. The Fed's action on Wednesday was expected to be quickly followed by announcements from commercial banks that they were raising their prime lending rates, currently at 5.25 percent, by another quarter point as well.  

In explaining its action, the Fed repeated a previous promise that it believed it would be able to raise rates at a "pace that is likely to be measured."  

Analysts believe the Fed will keep raising rates in small quarter-point steps as long as there are no signs that inflation is becoming a problem.  

Wall Street took the widely anticipated Fed action in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up for the day, remained in positive territory after the mid-afternoon Fed announcement.  

"What this says in a nutshell is that the economy is right where the Fed wants it to be," said David Jones, head of DMJ Advisors. "Inflation is contained and the Fed is happy about that."  

Consumer prices rose by 3.3 percent last year, compared to a 1.9 percent rise in 2003. It was the biggest annual increase since 2000, but it was driven by a surge in energy prices. Inflation pressures are expected to moderate this year, helped by an expected continued decline in global oil prices.  

The Fed's goal is to move the funds rate from an accommodative stance, where it is still stimulating extra economic growth, to a neutral stance where the funds rate is neither stimulating growth nor holding the economy back.  

"The Fed is taking its foot off the accelerator without hitting the brakes," said Richard DeKaser, chairman of an American Bankers Association panel of economists that meets twice a year with Fed policy-makers to give them their views of where the economy is headed.  

There is debate in economic circles about where the neutral level is, but many economists believe it is somewhere between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent for the federal funds rate.  

If the Fed keeps increasing rates by a quarter-point at each of the eight scheduled meetings this year, the funds rate would be at 4.25 percent at the end of this year, a level where many analysts believe Greenspan will feel good about stepping down in January 2006 when his term as a Fed board member ends.  

Financial markets became worried about the possibility of a more aggressive Fed stance in early January when a reading of the minutes of the Fed's Dec. 14 meeting seemed to indicate growing worries about inflation inside the Fed.  

But in recent weeks various Fed officials have given speeches in which they have gone out of their way to stress that they do not believe inflation is getting out of hand.  

Economists are split on how high interest rates will go. Some believe the funds rate will end the year at 4.25 percent while others think if inflation pressures remain contained, the Fed may skip raising rates for a meeting or two.

 HDText:US Freddie Mac:Q4 Cash-Out Refinance Share Down Modestly   WC933 words   PD1 February 2005   ET13:32   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005. Market News International, Inc.   
   TD

     WASHINGTON (MktNews) - The following is the statement released 
Tuesday by U.S. mortgage finance company Freddie Mac on cash-out 
percentages in refinanced loans during the fourth quarter of last year:

     "In the fourth quarter of 2004, 56% of Freddie Mac-owned loans that 
were refinanced resulted in new mortgages at least 5% higher in amount 
than the original mortgages, according to Freddie Mac's quarterly 
refinance review. This is in contrast to the third quarter of 2004, when 
59% of refinanced loans had higher new loan amounts. 

     "'The dip in 30-year fixed mortgage rates that happened in the 
fourth quarter brought down the cash-out share of new refinancings even 
though the total share of refis went up,' said Frank Nothaft, Freddie 
Mac vice president and chief economist. 'When homeowners decide to 
refinance because of falling interest rates, they might take cash out of 
home equity because it is convenient, but it is not the main reason they 
are seeking a new loan. As interest rates rise over this year we should 
see higher cash-out shares among refi loans but total dollars cashed-out 
should be lower than in 2004.' 

     "Freddie Mac expects growth in U.S. Gross Domestic Product in 2005 
to reach 3.9%, a little stronger than 2004's growth rate of 3.7%, and a 
continuation of the low core rate of inflation (which excludes the 
direct impact of the volatile food and energy components) as measured by 
the Consumer Price Index. The Federal Reserve Board (Fed) has indicated 
that it views monetary policy as accommodative and this accommodation 
could be removed at a 'measured' pace. 'We expect this means another 
quarter-percentage point increase in short-term interest rates when the 
Fed's Open Market Committee meets on February 1 and 2, and perhaps again 
when they meet on March 22,' noted Nothaft. 

     "Freddie Mac expects 30-year fixed mortgage rates will begin to 
rise, but still remain modest, indicating that 2005 will likely be 
another good year for housing. Thirty-year, fixed mortgage rates will 
probably rise by about one-half of a percentage point over the year, 
averaging between 6.1 and 6.3% in the fourth quarter, up from an average 
of 5.7% over January. Because of these slightly higher rates, home sales 
and home construction will come down from the record levels of 2004, but 
only by one to 3%. 

     "'Applications for refinance hit 47% in the fourth quarter of 
2004,' said Amy Crews Cutts, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist. 'In 
recent weeks mortgage rates have come down below 5.7%, so we are 
expecting relatively high refinance activity, around a 45% share of new 
applications, to continue during the first quarter of 2005.  However, 
due to the small share of mortgages outstanding with rates above 6.5%, 
it is unlikely that the refi share will exceed 50% or stay there long if 
it does. Based on our January outlook for mortgage originations and refi 
activity over the next two years, we estimate the amount of home equity 
cashed-out through prime, first lien refinances to total $96 billion in 
2005 and $61 billion in 2006. Total equity cashed out in the fourth 
quarter is estimated at $41 billion, up from the revised cash-out 
estimate for the third quarter of $42 billion.' 

     "In the fourth quarter of 2004, the median ratio of old-to-new 
interest rate was 1.13. In other words, one-half of those borrowers who 
paid off their original loan and took out a new one had an interest rate 
on their old loan that was at least 13% higher than the new interest 
rate. 
                   
     "'In the fourth quarter of 2004, homeowners who refinanced their 
mortgages lowered their rate an average of 0.74 percentage points.  On 
an average loan size of $150,000, that lower rate translates into a 
payment that is about $74 a month lower for a savings of more than $885 
annually,' said Cutts. 

     "'In aggregate, homeowners who have refinanced their mortgages over 
the past 12 months will save $1.7 billion in 2005 in lower interest 
costs. These savings offset some of the burdens on families from higher 
gasoline prices and home heating costs,' Cutts added. 

     "The Cash-Out Refinance Report also revealed that properties 
refinanced during the fourth quarter of 2004 experienced a median 
house-price appreciation of 15% during the time since the original loan 
was made, down slightly from the 17% appreciation on loans refinanced in 
the third quarter. For loans refinanced in the fourth quarter of 2004, 
the median age of the original loan was 2.2 years, four months younger 
than the median age of loans refinanced during the third quarter. 

     "These estimates come from a sample of properties on which Freddie 
Mac has funded at least two successive loans. Transactions are further 
screened to verify that the latest loan is for refinance rather than for 
home purchase. The Freddie Mac analysis does not track the use of funds 
made available from these refinances. 

     "Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by 
Congress in 1970 to create a continuous flow of funds to mortgage 
lenders in support of homeownership and rental housing. Freddie Mac 
purchases mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities that 
are sold to investors. Over the years, Freddie Mac has made home 
possible for one in six homebuyers and more than two million renters 
across America."

The strong voter turnout and limited violence during Iraq's elections combined with merger news and positive economic reports to drive stocks up at the opening bell yesterday. But oil prices, which began the day down, turned up by afternoon amid continuing jitters about Middle East stability and oil supplies. That, together with skittishness about stocks' weak January performance, combined to limit the day's advance.
   TDThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 82.99 points shortly after trading began, never got back there, finishing ahead 62.74 points, or 0.60%, at 10489.94. Despite a rebound in recent days, the Dow industrials ended the month with a decline of 293.07 points, or 2.7%. It was the industrial average's fourth down January in the past six years, a turbulent period for stocks.

Just about every other widely followed index, from large stocks to small stocks and from drug stocks to computer-chip stocks, also declined in January, many of them also recording their fourth declines in six years. A rare exception was the Dow Jones Utility Average, a traditional safe haven.

January has long been something of a bellwether for the rest of the year. Going back to the Dow industrials' first full year in 1897, a January gain has been followed by 11 more months of gains 71% of the time. But when the Dow has declined in January, the chance of a gain in the next 11 months was only 50-50.

And the size of the market's move has been weaker if the year begins with a decline. After rising in January, the Dow has averaged a 7.8% gain in the 11 remaining months. But it has averaged a gain of just 3.7% after falling in January, according to The Wall Street Journal's Market Data Group.

"No one is shrugging that off," said Todd Clark, head of listed trading at San Francisco brokerage firm Wells Fargo Securities. "Historically January is one of the strongest months, so people are concerned, and rightfully so."

He noted that the Nasdaq Composite Index, whose many technology stocks lately have led the market both up and down, finished January down 5.2%, despite a gain yesterday of 1.31%, or 26.58 points, to 2062.41. It was the Nasdaq's worst January decline since 1990. The Russell 2000 small-stock index, another leader in the current bull market, fell 4.2% on the month, also its worst January since 1990.

Every year is a unique case, of course, and many other events will influence stock behavior this year. The last time the Dow fell in January was 2003, after which the industrials reversed course and finished up 25% for the year. Stocks sagged at the start of the year on worries about the Iraq war but then rebounded. The bottom line: Stocks rise in most years, but if they fall in January, the risk of weakness later is higher.

This isn't a statistical anomaly. January is when investors -- professional money managers and individuals -- typically put new retirement money into stocks. That buying spree is one big reason January normally is a strong month for stocks.

Yesterday did offer some positive news. Investors were dazzled by a series of takeover announcements, involving such household names as Procter &Gamble, Gillette, SBC Communications, AT&T, MetLife and Citigroup. The news suggested that big, powerful companies have cash on their books that they are prepared to spend now, which typically encourages the stock market.

In addition, economic reports showed strong December personal-income gains and strong January business activity in the Chicago region.

The market also appears to have broken away from its tendency, during the worst of the January declines, to sag at day's end. Stocks managed a mild late-day rebound yesterday.

But new home sales were soft in December. And some of the main gainers yesterday were the stocks that had fallen the most earlier in the month.

Of particular concern was the inability of oil prices to stay down, despite the good news from Iraq and despite the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to hold production steady. If oil's price stays around $50 a barrel -- it closed yesterday at $48.20, up $1.02 -- that would be a disappointment. Crude rose 11% in January, after falling 12% in December.

Another cause of jitters is the Federal Reserve interest-rate meeting that opens today and continues through tomorrow. Fed leaders are expected to push their short-term interest-rate target up another quarter point to 2.5%. That still is very low, but investors will be anxiously perusing the Fed's comments tomorrow for signs of whether it still plans to keep future rate increases moderate.

The broad Standard &Poor's 500-stock index yesterday rose 0.85%, or 9.91 points, to 1181.27, down 2.5% for January.

The dollar rebounded 4.1% against the euro in January, its strongest month since March 2001.

Bonds rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, or 31.25 cents for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield down to 4.134%.

 CLMREVIEW &OUTLOOK (Editorial)   HDAnimal Spirits and the Fed   WC834 words   PD1 February 2005   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA12   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPThe Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets this week, amid media and Wall Street moans that the economy has "slowed." We assume the FOMC nabobs know better. The economy is rolling along very well, thank you, and if anything the Fed needs to continue putting starch back into its monetary policy.

The "slowing" spin is coming from last Friday's report that fourth-quarter GDP growth was only 3.1%, which was down from earlier in 2004. Inspect the details of that quarterly report, however, and you quickly see that it was far better than the top line. Overall private-sector output (minus government spending and trade) grew by a very snappy 5.5%, while business investment climbed 10.3%.
   TDEveryone is supposed to be alarmed that a jump in imports, and thus a larger trade deficit, cut 1.73 percentage points off the GDP rate. But all this means is that the U.S. economy continues to grow more rapidly than most of the rest of world, sucking in both imports and capital. It would be splendid if Japan, Germany and France would grow faster, but that doesn't mean the U.S. ought to slow down merely so Americans will import less. On the list of economic matters to worry about, "the trade deficit" is about 75th -- unless politicians react to it by imposing new trade barriers or devaluing the currency.

As for the economic "weakness" chorus, we're inclined to adapt Groucho Marx's line and ask, "Who are you gonna believe, the media, or your own eyes?" The Commerce Department said yesterday that personal income increased by 3.7% in December, and 8.6% for the full year, the best annual showing since 2000. Also yesterday, the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index popped up to 62.4 in January, keeping it above 60 for five months in a row. This means that Chicago-area manufacturing continues to cook.

Meanwhile, the merger and acquisition market is roaring ahead, with multi-billion-dollar deals announced nearly every other day. Yesterday MetLife Inc. said it will buy Citigroup's Travelers Life &Annuity unit for $11.5 billion, on the heels of last week's news that Procter &Gamble is buying Gillette and SBC Communications will acquire AT&T. (See the nearby table of the top 10 global deals in the past two months.)

These are all signs that what Keynes called the economy's "animal spirits" are once again on the loose. Businesses don't lay out billions of dollars for such acquisitions without sensing growth ahead. Some of these mergers will turn out better than others, and some may even be busts. But at the macroeconomic level what matters is that CEOs are once again in the mood to take risks. The AT&T-SBC deal is especially notable as a sign that the dormant telecom sector may finally be stirring. After two years of rising stock prices and healthy price-earnings ratios, companies can also afford to pay for acquisitions with stock as well as cash.

The U.S. economy is now into its fourth year of expansion, and about 18 months into an acceleration phase that began in mid-2003 after the passage of the Bush tax cuts. GDP growth over that period, including the 2004 fourth quarter, was well above 4%. It's hardly surprising that the stock market has recently entered its own slower-growth phase, since corporate earnings gains are unlikely to be as rapid as they've been during the last two years. But there is no reason to believe, barring policy mistakes or a terrorist shock, that this expansion can't continue for a long run.

Which brings us back to the Fed. Outside of a tax increase, the biggest policy threat to this expansion has been too-easy money that lets inflation revive or the dollar plunge and forces sharply higher interest rates down the road. With the economy strong, it has been long past time for the Fed to pull in the reins and steer into net positive real interest rate territory. The commodity and oil price surges of the past year have been warning signs, and belatedly the Fed has begun to heed them. Now is not the time to stop.

 HDEconomists expect Fed keep increasing interest rates this year     BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA     CRAP Economics Writer   WC728 words   PD1 February 2005   ET20:48   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2005.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve policy-makers are likely to keep bumping up short-term interest rates this year, a defense against an inflation flare-up now that the economic expansion is on firm footing.  

The Fed is expected to boost its key federal funds rate by one-quarter point to 2.50 percent Wednesday. The policy-makers, in their first gathering of 2005, opened a two-day meeting Tuesday.  
   TDFor now, economists are predicting Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues will stick to their approach of gradually raising interest rates in the months ahead. Thus far, there's been no reason to veer off that path -- either by speeding up or slowing down the rate-raising campaign.  

That campaign, which started in June 2004, has resulted in five, one-quarter point increases in the federal funds rate, which now stands at 2.25 percent.  

The funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans, is the Fed's primary tool for influencing the economy. Before the Fed started to push rates up in June, the funds rate stood at a 46-year low of 1 percent.  

The extraordinarily low funds rate had been used to help shore up the economy, which had been struggling to get back to full throttle after being knocked by the 2001 recession and terror attacks. With the economic expansion more deeply rooted, the Fed needs to move the funds rate to a more normal level so all the cheap money doesn't sow the seeds of inflation.  

"You could call this the no-surprises Fed," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. "A continuation of the one-quarter percentage point increments is in the offing. They will assess as they go each step."  

Tannenbaum and other economists believe the Fed will maintain its current stance that further interest rate increase can be "at a pace that is likely to be measured."  

A quarter-point increase in the funds rate would mean that commercial banks' prime lending rate used for many short-term consumer and business loans, would climb to 5.50 percent, from the current 5.25 percent. The prime rate moves in lockstep with the funds rate.  

Even with the Fed's string of rate increases, longer-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates, have been well behaved, in part reflecting investors' confidence that the Fed is on top of inflation. Rates on 30-year mortgages fell last week to 5.66 percent, marking the fourth week in a row that these rates declined.  

For all 2004, consumer prices rose 3.3 percent, the most since 2000. Much of that pickup reflecting surging energy prices.  

Excluding energy and food costs, "core" prices increased by 2.2 percent last year. While core prices were up considerably compared with the 1.1 percent increase registered in 2003, they are still considered relatively low by historical standards, analysts say.  

"The economy seems to be on a well balanced track. We've had good growth on the consumer and business side and inflation is not worrisome," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management.  

The economy finished 2004 with its best performance in five years despite slowing in the final stretch. Economic growth clocked a 4.4 percent increase for all of last year spurred by brisk consumer and business spending.  

In the October-to-December quarter, however, the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate, its most sluggish pace since the first quarter of 2003. That deceleration reflected a drag on growth from the nation's bloated trade deficit.  

Still, the outlook for 2005 is good, with economists predicting the economy will grow by 3.5 percent or more. That would be sufficient to spur modest -- not spectacular -- job growth in the months ahead, analysts said. The nation's payrolls in 2004 expanded by 2.2 million, the first annual increase in three years.  

Some economists believe the Fed wants to push up the funds rate to around 3.50 percent this year. Others think the fund rate will end up around 4 percent. Either figure, analysts said, would be relatively neutral, meaning it would neither slow nor stimulate economic activity.
