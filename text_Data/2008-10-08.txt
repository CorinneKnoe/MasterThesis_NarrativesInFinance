--Also Cuts Rate For Emergency Credit Facility to 3% From 5%

By Brai Odion-Esene

     WASHINGTON (MNI) - In keeping with its policy of pegging the value 
of its currency to the U.S. dollar, the United Arab Emirates imitated 
the Federal Reserve late Wednesday and cut its interest rate on the 
repurchase of central bank Certificates of Deposit (repo) by 50 basis 
points. 

     This lowered the rate from 2% to 1.5%, "in line with the new level 
of interest rate on U.S. dollar decided by the Federal Reserve Bank," 
the central of the UAE said in a statement. 

     The repo operation conducted by the central bank with banks 
operating in the UAE is the mechanism through which the interest rate on 
the Dirham -- the UAE currency -- is changed. 

     In addition, the bank lowered the interest rate on its $13.6 
billion emergency liquidity facility from 5% to 3%. The facility had 
allowed banks to draw down in excess of their required reserves for a 
period of one week at an interest rate -- charged separately on each 
drawdown -- that was set at 300 basis points over the prevailing 
Central Bank repo rate. 

     In the statement, UAE central bank Chairman Bin Nasser Al Suwaidi 
stressed the soundness of a banking sector that had been facing 
liquidity concerns recently. "Total assets reached AED1.3 trillion and 
the capital adequacy ratio averaged 13%, which is higher than the Basel 
requirement of 8%," he said. 

     Al Suwaidi also clarified in the statement that bank loans to the 
real estate sector are limited to 11% of total bank assets, and 18% of 
total deposits -- below the 20% maximum allowed by Law, part of the 
fight to improve bank liquidity. 

     Standard & Poor's noted in research report, that the UAE has strong 
credit fundamentals to withstand any liquidity squeeze as the country is 
only "tangentially" related to the global credit crunch. 

     According to S&P Credit analyst Farouk Soussa, "While financing 
conditions are becoming more challenging, we don't consider that the 
creditworthiness of rated domestic entities will be affected." 

     If liquidity conditions remain tight, he said, funding future 
projects will, however, become more difficult, "thereby affecting the 
UAE economy's hitherto extraordinary growth." 

     The report notes that a cooling in growth would not necessarily be 
a bad thing as it could alleviate infrastructure and resource: "If this 
tightening starts to bite too hard, we believe the UAE has the resources 
to ease liquidity constraints at short notice," Soussa said. 

     This action by the UAE follows not just the global rate-cutting 
action by major central banks, but also by the Kingdom of Kuwait. 

     As reported Wednesday, the Central Bank of Kuwait slashed the 
discount rate 125 points, from 5.75% to 4.5%. 

     The Kuwaiti stock market has been declining in response to the 
world financial crisis, dropping 3.59% Sunday in its worst day this 
week. There have been calls for trading to be temporarily halted and for 
government intervention to cut losses. 

     Governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait, Salem Abdulaziz Al-Sabah, 
emphasized the "keenness" of the bank in what he described as "sensitive 
times" to stand ready to employ all monetary tools and supervisory 
measures at its disposal to enhance confidence and secure monetary and 
financial stability in the national economy. 

     The Kuwait Investment Authority -- the kingdom's sovereign wealth 
fund -- has already acted in recent weeks to stem sharp falls in the 
Kuwaiti equity market, buying shares in the stock market to prop it up.

     SINGAPORE, Oct. 9 (MNI) - The U.S. dollar eased back from early 
highs through the Asian afternoon Thursday after coordinated global 
interest rate cuts failed to fully placate investors, who continued to 
sell stocks on rallies and seek shelter in safe-haven instruments. 

     The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Canada, 
the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the Swedish Riksbank 
all lowered benchmark rates by 50 basis points just ahead of the U.S. 
open yesterday. 

     In addition, the People's Bank of China cut the one-year deposit 
and lending rate by 27 basis points effective Thursday and also 
announced a 50 basis point reduction in the commercial bank reserve 
requirement effective Oct. 15. 

     In Asia today, the move was followed by interest rate cuts in 
Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. 

     Although Asian stocks initially made modest gains after the central 
bank actions, the Japanese currency remained relatively firm, and stock 
markets there eventually gave up early gains, signalling risk aversion 
was still elevated. 

     "The coordinated action shows much closer policy coordination in 
the face of the obvious threat that disorderly financial markets pose 
for economic stability," commented strategists at JPMorgan Chase Bank. 

     "But markets took limited comfort, as the flight from risk slowed 
rather than reversed." 

     Japan's Nikkei average ended the day down 0.5%, its lowest close 
since June 2003, shedding 45.83 points to 9,157.49. The broader Topix 
finished up 0.7% at 905.11 after earlier rising more than 3%. 

     Dollar-yen had slumped to a six-month low of Y98.92 last night and 
then started the Asian session with a move back through Y99.00 and then 
through yesterday's low of Y99.60. 

     The pair then probed above Y101.00 just before midday here but 
failed to extend the gains, holding well off the overnight Y101.73 high 
as euro-yen also poked its head above Y138.00, before ending the day 
around Y137.70.80 compared with last night's high of Y138.84. 

     "It was only after Tokyo fix that dollar-yen began climbing back 
above Y100.20  bulk of the demand linked to an increase in risk 
appetite," said a dealer in Asia. 

     Euro-dollar meanwhile briefly broke above the morning's $1.3577 to 
$1.3702 range and touched $1.3705 before also easing back to $1.3680, 
not very much changed from where it was at midday here. 

     "The main obstacle to confidence returning to markets is the 
widespread belief that the problem is now global, and not just confined 
to the U.S.," said DBS Bank analysts. 

     In other currencies, the Korean won fell to its weakest since April 
1998, before then recovering some its losses after the central bank cut 
interest rates and as rumors spread of foreign exchange authorities 
selling dollars to prop up the won. 

     The Bank of Korea lowered its base rate to 5.00% from a 7-1/2-year 
high of 5.25% set in August, when the central bank was guarding against 
mounting inflation expectations. 

     It was the bank's first cut since late 2004 and the first reduction 
cut after a string of 8 increases. 

     The U.S. currency rose to a Krw1,485.85 this morning before 
slipping back to around Krw1,408.30 before midday here and then sliding 
to a fresh session low near Krw1,370. 

     "The currency market is still experiencing volatile trading and 
safe-havens remain favored amid a minor gain in risk appetite," 
commented UBS analysts.

     LONDON (MNI) - European Government Bond prices opened lower 
Thursday, taking their cue from weakness in US Treasuries overnight 
after a soggy US 10-year TIPS auction and a recovery in regional Asian 
equity bourses. The move comes after coordinated global interest rate 
cuts failed to fully soothe investor fears about the credit crisis and 
the global economy. 

     As was widely rumoured, the Federal Reserve, the European Central 
Bank, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank 
and the Swedish Riksbank all lowered benchmark rates by 50bps just ahead 
of the U.S. open yesterday. 

     In addition, the People's Bank of China cut the one-year deposit 
and lending rate by 27 basis points effective Thursday and also 
announced a 50 basis point reduction in the commercial bank reserve 
requirement effective Oct. 15. 

     Overnight in Asia, the move was followed by interest rate cuts in 
Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. 

     The Bund yield curve is seen maintaining its steepening bias, with 
the short-dated issues underpinned by dovish comments from ECB 
Bini-Smaghi and Liikanen. Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi 
said the European Central Bank is poised to revise down its current GDP 
forecast of 1.2% in 2009 and slower growth could lead to a more rapid 
decline in inflation.  In an interview with Italian business daily 
IlSole24Ore, Bini-Smaghi also refused to rule out a technical recession 
in the euro area, saying there was a risk that GDP could also be 
negative in the third quarter of the year after Eurostat confirmed 
yesterday that the economy contracted -0.2% in the second three months 
of the year. 

     ECB council member Erkki Liikanen said that the direction of 
interest rates is down and said that inflation expectations are settling 
close to its 2% target. The Bund 2-/10-year yield spread is at +79bps, 
having steepened to +85bps following the announcement of the coordinated 
rate cuts on Wednesday, breaking above the February peak at +83.8bps. On 
l/t charts, gains to +104.0bps -- the 61.8% of the +184.8bps to -26bps 
flattening move. 

     Elsewhere, no sovereign supply is scheduled in the eurozone on 
Thursday following issuance this week from Austria and Germany, where 
demand was decent. Austria sold E550mln of the 3.50% July 2015 RAGB 
issue on Tuesday at average yield 3.902% and covered 2.88 times. Germany  
alloted E5.62bln in re-opening of the 4.00% Sept 2010 Schatz issue on 
Wednesday at average yield of 3.03% and covered 1.72 times. This supply 
is outweighed by reinvestment flows -- redemption due from Germany 
E14.0bln and coupon payments from Germany E2.2bln and Italy E0.50bln -- 
to leave net cash flow positive to tune of E7.6bln vs +E0.9bln last 
week. For full details of forthcoming issues, please see eurozone/UK 
bond auction calendar & MNI/SMRA Eurozone Net Cash Flow. 

     It was going to be a day dominated by the UK interest rate 
decision, though the steps taken yesterday, included shelving today's 
meeting of the MPC. 

     Data from Europe starts at 0600GMT with September wholesale prices 
data from Germany. 

     This is followed at 0800GMT by the ECB monthly bulletin, which will 
likely be a side-issue. The editorial of the bulletin normally broadly 
repeats the opening statement delivered by the ECB President at the 
previous post-meeting press conference. 

     The UK gets trade data at 0830GMT, while at 0900GMT,  the 
Bundesbank Vice President Franz-Christoph Zeitler speaks in Frankfurt on 
European financial market integration. 

     Also in Europe today, ECB Governing Council member John Hurley is 
due to speak, in Dublin. 

     US data starts at 1230GMT, when jobless claims are expected to fall 
22,000 to 475,000 in the October 4 week. The impact of the hurricanes 
may still be seen in the data. 

     At 1300GMT, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn holds a 
press briefing in Washington ahead of the annual meetings. 

     US wholesale inventories for August are due at 1400GMT, ahead of 
the weekly natural gas stocks data at 1435GMT. 

     At 1500GMT, World Bank President Robert Zoellick holds a press 
briefing. 

     At 1730GMT, Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern is due to speak 
about financial shock repercussions. An audience Q&A session is expected 
to follow the speech. 

     US data then concludes with the 1900GMT release of Treasury 
Allotments by class for September and the 2030GMT release of M2 money 
supply for the September 29 week. 

     At 2200GMT, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren is due to speak 
about the impact on financial markets on the real economy, at the 
University of Wisconsin, in Madison.

 HDUS has dwindling number of tools for econ crisis   BYBy TOM RAUM      CRAssociated Press Writer   WC995 words   PD9 October 2008   ET22:46   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - What is left in the U.S. government's economic tool kit?

The commitment of $700 billion did not impress markets here or around the world. Neither did fresh interest rate cuts. Stocks plunged yet again on Thursday.
   TDThe government still has some unused options, such as buying up foreclosed properties or making direct loans to homeowners, that might ease the credit and housing crises and brighten the economic outlook.

But the options are dwindling and generally involve partly taking over private companies, an idea that is anathema to economic conservatives and others in America.

Even as policymakers counsel patience in waiting for the medicine already prescribed to kick in fully, they are searching hard for other approaches.

"So long as financial conditions warrant, we will continue to look for ways to reduce funding pressures in key markets," says Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.

The primary tools of the Fed, the U.S. central bank, are lowering interest rates and flooding the system with money. It already has done plenty of both.

It could further lower interest rates, and probably will if the downturn continues. But after this week's cut of one-half a percentage point, coordinated with other nations' central banks, there is not a much lower for the U.S. economic team to go.

Since September 2007, the Federal Reserve has pushed its benchmark short-term rate down to 1.5 percent from 5.25 percent.

The Fed presided over by Alan Greenspan kept interest rates at 1 percent for a full year early in the decade, and many economists suggest that was one of the root causes of the housing bubble because it made it too easy for people to sign on to loans they could not afford.

Besides, in Japan holding rates near zero for years did little to help a deeply troubled economy.

The Fed could inject more money. Already, however, it has flooded the financial system with hundreds of billions of dollars.

Also, bold action by the central bank can have unintended consequences by signaling to investors that the situation may be worse than they thought, thereby contributing to the downward market spiral.

Apart from the Fed, Congress enacted a bailout package last week backed by up to $700 billion in federal money, on top of a $300 billion housing package passed during the summer. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says it will be weeks before the government starts using the bailout money to buy up soured mortgage-based securities.

The Treasury is now considering using some of the money to take part ownership in certain U.S. banks. That could put the government in the uncomfortable position of regulating banks in which it is an investor.

Many economists say that actions taken so far do little to deal with what is at the heart of the spreading financial contagion: falling housing prices and rising foreclosures.

Former White House economist Glenn Hubbard proposes that the government refinance every U.S. mortgage held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, public-private mortgage giants, into 30-year loans fixed at 5.25 percent. He also suggests that putting in place a cleanup agency modeled on the Resolution Trust Corp. of the late 1980s and early 1990s could help.

The RTC was set up to deal with a crisis in the savings and loan business. The government actually took over more than a thousand failed S&Ls, and all their assets. It wound up owning foreclosed homes and other property and eventually resold them.

It took six years to clean up that mess. The total cost to taxpayers: about $125 billion.

Economist Rob Shapiro, of NDN, a think tank formerly known as the New Democratic Network, said that so far the Fed is "putting as many fingers as it can in the dike" without stemming the flood. He said the government should consider direct government loans to homeowners facing foreclosure.

"There are a range of proposals out there. The focus of the administration and Congress on Wall Street to the exclusion of homeowners is very economically and politically myopic," said Shapiro, an economic adviser in the administration of former President Bill Clinton.

Republican presidential candidate John McCain has proposed a $300 billion program for the government to help financially troubled homeowners stay in their homes by taking over their mortgages and renegotiating the terms, which is authorized by the $700 billion package signed last Friday by President George W. Bush.

While that would be expensive, McCain said, "until we stabilize home values in America, we are never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy." Critics of the McCain plan complained that many of the mortgages involved have been repackaged into complex investments that are now nearly impossible to value, and the government would be hard-pressed to unravel and buy them individually.

Democrat Barack Obama has recommended that the administration move quickly to "use the authority they already have to purchase troubled assets, including mortgages."

World Bank President Robert Zoellick suggests greater coordination with other major economies in an economically interconnected world. For starters, he says, the Group of Seven club should be disbanded and reformed in a larger grouping. In addition to the G7 countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- membership might include Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, Zoellick suggests.

Asked what tools the government has left, White House press secretary Dana Perino said, "They have a whole range of new tools from ... all sorts of technical terms that I do not know. But they're working very hard. And Neel Kashkari will be in charge of that. He's setting up shop and trying to hire as many people as possible."

Kashkari is the interim head of the program that will oversee the $700 billion bailout.

 HDRate cut loosens credit only at the margins   BYBy MADLEN READ      CRAP Business Writer   WC1,015 words   PD10 October 2008   ET01:14   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - The credit markets might not be quite as squeezed as they have been recently, thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut. But they're hardly back to normal.

In two signs of continued strain, a key bank-to-bank lending rate rose Thursday and the amount of commercial paper in the market fell for the fourth straight week to 15 percent below the level before the investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
   TDWhile lending doesn't appear to be in the same seized-up state as last week, the year-end could prove a difficult time for funding as banks and other institutions try to get their books in order, said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income analysis at Action Economics.

"It looks like the central bank's actions are starting to help marginally improve confidence enough where safe haven isn't the only thing on investors' minds," Rupert said. "But it's only one small step so far. It's going to be a very jagged type of improvement. There's still a lot of factors that are going to keep anxiety at elevated levels."

The London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, for three-month dollar loans rose to 4.75 percent from 4.52 percent on Wednesday. Just a month ago, three-month Libor was at 2.81 percent.

That stubbornly high Libor is just one of the reasons that the stock market has been tumbling. When banks are loath to lend, a weak economy has a hard time bouncing back. The Dow Jones industrial average sank nearly 679 points on Thursday to the lowest level in five years.

Libor's sharp jump over the past month is worrisome because consumer loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages are tied to Libor -- meaning that those mortgages could become harder to pay. Citigroup analysts recently predicted that continued stress in Libor will result in a 10 percent jump in defaults for outstanding non-delinquent adjustable-rate mortgages when they reset.

Libor for overnight dollar loans slipped to 5.09 percent Thursday from 5.38 percent, but still remains extremely high -- especially compared to the target Fed funds rate, a key overnight lending rate that the Federal Reserve slashed Wednesday by a half-point to 1.5 percent.

Meanwhile, commercial paper outstanding dropped for the fourth straight week. Commercial paper is a type of debt companies sell to get short-term cash, often so that they can maintain their inventories and payrolls. The Fed said commercial paper outstanding fell by $56.4 billion to a seasonally-adjusted $1.55 trillion in the week ended Oct. 8 -- that's down from $1.82 billion on Sept. 10, and down 30 percent from the peak of $2.2 trillion in the summer of 2007.

As companies have a harder time getting financing, businesses and municipalities have been taking action to try to adapt. Connecticut's governor is requesting that banks statewide to contribute at least $1 million each to a lending pool for small businesses. And Apollo Management LP is offering a $540 million capital infusion to its affiliate Hexion Specialty Chemicals to help Hexion close its takeover of Huntsman Corp; Hexion said it doubted that Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG would provide financing.

Automakers and dealers have been especially hard hit by the double-whammy of a slow economy and squeezed credit. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services on Thursday put General Motors Corp. and its 49 percent-owned finance affiliate GMAC LLC on negative credit watch. It also put Ford Motor Co. on negative credit watch. That means there is a 50 percent chance that S&P will lower the ratings on these companies in the next three months; S&P said that while their liquidity is adequate now, deteriorating conditions could challenge their liquidity in 2009.

There were a few promising signs that the stranglehold on the credit markets is starting to loosen, at least in some areas.

One was that the recent drop in commercial paper was smaller than the $94.9 billion decline in the previous week, and the $61 billion decrease in the week ended Sept. 24. And last week's decline occurred in financial companies' commercial paper and asset-backed commercial paper -- commercial paper issued by non-financial companies edged higher overall.

"We're still seeing a lot of investments in overnights and very short maturities," said Alex Roever, a fixed-income analyst with JPMorgan. "The really strong financial and non-financial names -- top tier corporations -- are seeing stronger interest in one-month, two-month, three-month paper. It's definitely better than where it was a week or so ago."

Moreover, following the Fed's Tuesday decision to buy commercial paper and Wednesday's move to slash the key interest rate, the rates on certain overnight commercial paper fell by 1.15 percentage points on Thursday to 2.35 percent, noted Miller Tabak & Co. analyst Tony Crescenzi.

And IBM Corp. was able to sell $3.9 billion in longer-term bonds on the market Thursday after posting better-than-expected profits.

But investors are still anxious. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill initially edged up on Thursday, but then slipped to 0.58 percent from 0.63 percent late Wednesday. That suggests that demand for T-bills, regarded by investors as the safest assets around, remains high. The discount rate was also 0.58 percent.

Longer-term Treasury yields were mixed after the stock market's plunge.

   LPHONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong's de facto central bank cut its benchmark interest rate for a second day Thursday in a bid to boost investor confidence, matching an overnight rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut its key rate by half a point to 2 percent, a day after it lowered it by a full percentage point.
   TDThe combined 1.5 percentage point cut came after the Fed and other top central banks around the world cut their interest rate to encourage lending amid the global credit crunch.

"The coordinated rate cuts by global central banks is unprecedented and that reflected the seriousness of the financial crisis of this century," said HKMA Chief Executive Joseph Yam.

Investors in Hong Kong cheered the latest rate cuts, sending the Hang Seng index up more than 3 percent.

Wednesday's full-point cut came after the HKMA revised its formula for calculating its base rate from 150 basis points, or 1.5 percentage points, above the prevailing U.S. Fed funds target rate to 50 basis points. That lowered Hong Kong's benchmark rate to 2.5 percent.

When the Fed lowered its key rate by half a point to 1.5 percent overnight, the HKMA followed Thursday by cutting its rate again to 2 percent.

TOKYO/SYDNEY, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Most U.S. Treasury yields fell in Asia on Friday as investors fled plunging stock markets to the relative safety of sovereign debt on hopes for more urgent action by global policymakers to stem the crisis.

With Japan's Nikkei share average down over 10 percent after a 7.6 percent dive in the S&P 500, investors rushed to the most liquid end of the Treasury curve.

Rates on one-month T-bill plunged 76 basis points from late U.S. trade to just 0.05 percent.

But gains in Treasuries were trimmed by a sell-off in Japanese government bonds as a freeze in the key repurchase market left dealers short of the cash needed to fund their books, driving JGB futures down more than 2 points.

A massive flattening of the yen interest-rate swap curve, due to derivative desks having to hedge the risk tied to once-popular structured notes they sold to investors, spilled into the Treasuries market as well.

The 10-year note rose 10/32 in price, taking its yield down 3 basis points to 3.745 percent. December 10-year Treasury futures rose 19/32 to 114-4/32 after soaring to 114-30/32 at one point.

But the two-year note normally seen as the safe-haven maturity, fell 3/32 to yield 1.574 percent, up about 5 basis points and causing the yield curve to flatten.

The mayhem in stock markets stoked talk that the major central banks would have to cut interest rates again, just days after a concerted round of easings led by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and others.

There were also reports the U.S. Treasury was under intense pressure to inject funds directly into commercial banks right now, rather than at the end of the month as first suggested.

"One focal point in the market is whether the United States could bring up a new financial rescue step that is similar to the British government's plan to inject capital to banks," said Akihiro Nishida, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.

The pressure on bank funding was clear in three-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars which surged to 4.75 percent on Thursday, from 4.52 percent the day before and just 2.88 percent less than a month ago.

That in turn widened the spread over expected official overnight rates to a record of 352 basis points, up 30 basis points from Wednesday and 68 basis points a week ago as the freeze in global money markets showed no sign of thawing.

In Asia, three-month dollar borrowing costs were as high as 5.50 percent as the rate cuts did nothing to stop the ongoing deterioration in money markets that has stoked speculation central banks could guarantee interbank lending.

The rising cost of borrowing came despite the Federal Reserve lending a record $420 billion a day to banks at its discount window in the week to Oct. 8. That was on top of massive U.S. dollar lending by major central banks across the globe.

"Unfortunately coordinated central bank action has had no impact on term funding," noted Adam Carr, a senior economist at broker ICAP.

Carr said banks have raised insufficient capital to effectively deal with the widespread asset deleveraging that has also hit commodities.

This prompted the U.S. Treasury to propose taking direct equity stakes within the next couple of weeks, but now it looked like they did not have the luxury to wait.

With the Group of Seven rich countries meeting in Washington on Friday, investors were hoping they could agree on immediate action, including more rate cuts.

"It highlights the enormity of the issue and the problem faced by the G7," said Carr. "Given the muted response in markets, certainly I think more rate cuts are to come, as ineffective as they are proving. Lets hope the G7 propose a good dose of fiscal medicine to the real economy as well."

Eurodollar futures jumped across the curve as investors priced in more easing from the Fed, possibly before its Oct. 28-29 meeting.

   LPOct 9 (Reuters) - South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan on Thursday followed the U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks from Europe, Canada and China in cutting interest rates to contain the market meltdown.

Following are some details about interest rate cuts announced this week by central banks around the world:
   TD* AUSTRALIA - The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its benchmark cash rate by 100 basis points to 6.0 percent on Tuesday, stunning investors with its biggest interest rate cut in 16 years.

* BAHRAIN - Bahrain cut its one-week deposit rate and overnight lending rate by 25 basis points and its repurchase rate by 50 basis points on Thursday. The one-week deposit rate was reduced to 1.75 percent from 2 percent and the overnight deposit rate was reduced to 1.25 percent from 1.5 percent.

* BRITAIN - The Bank of England cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday. The unscheduled cut to 4.5 percent was the biggest in seven years and only the second time the BoE has moved interest rates outside of its regular monthly cycle since the central bank was made independent in 1997.

* CANADA - The Bank of Canada unexpectedly cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.50 percent on Wednesday.

* CHINA - China cut interest rates and lowered banks' required reserves on Wednesday. The cost of one-year bank loans will fall from Thursday to 6.93 percent from 7.20 percent, while the benchmark one-year deposit rate will fall to 3.87 percent from 4.14 percent. It is the first time that the People's Bank of China has announced a change in interest rates at the same time as other central banks.

* EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK - The European Central Bank on Wednesday slashed its main rate to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent and said it would halve the premium banks pay for emergency borrowing over its main refinancing rate.

* HONG KONG - The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday lowered the base rate charged through its overnight discount window by 50 basis points to 2.0 percent.

* INDIA - The Reserve Bank of India on Monday said it would cut the cash reserve ratio for banks by 50 basis points to 8.5 percent from Oct. 11, a step it said would release 200 billion rupees ($4.2 billion) into the banking system.

* ISRAEL - The Bank of Israel reduced its key lending rate by a half-point to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent in an unscheduled move on Tuesday.

* KUWAIT - Kuwait slashed the benchmark discount rate to 4.5 percent from 5.75 percent and the repo rate to 2.5 percent from 3.5 percent on Wednesday.

* SOUTH KOREA - The Bank of Korea on Thursday lowered its base rate to 5.00 percent from a 7-1/2-year high of 5.25 percent set in August, the first rate reduction after a string of eight increases since late 2004.

* SWITZERLAND - The Swiss National Bank (SNB) lowered on Wednesday its target for the LIBOR by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent. It was the first time in over five years that SNB cut interest rates.

* TAIWAN - Taiwan's Central Bank slashed its interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, bringing down the benchmark discount rate to 3.25 percent, the lowest level since September 2007.

* USA - The Federal Reserve cut its key federal funds lending rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 percent on Wednesday. It also lowered its discount rate by the same amount to 1.75 percent.

   LPMove to shock credit markets back to life

In an unprecedented move, six of the world's most important central banks, including the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, yesterday announced simultaneous emergency interest rate cuts of half a percentage point.
   TDThe historic piece of co-ordination marks an effort to curb the risk that the intensification of the credit crisis could lead to a severe global recession. Policymakers hope the move will shore up confidence and help shock the credit markets back to life.

Meanwhile, Hank Paulson, the US Treasury secretary, signalled that the US authorities will use emergency powers to ensure there are no more disorderly failures of US financial institutions.

In the case of banks, he said regulators would use their emergency powers to protect even uninsured depositors and other creditors. Some experts interpreted this as a step towards an implicit guarantee of these liabilities. "The stability of the financial system is of paramount importance," he said.

Shaken by the bail-out of UK banks and the prospect that other European nations, and possibly the US, will recapitalise financial institutions, the markets gyrated violently yesterday.

In New York, the S&P index closed 1.1 per cent lower at 984.87, after falling 2.5 per cent. The FTSE 100 index closed 5.2 per cent lower and the FTSE 300 Eurofirst index slid 6.3 per cent.

The Nikkei 225 Average, which closed before the central banks' actions, fell 9.4 per cent, its biggest one-day fall since 1987.

The move was justified strictly in terms of an improved outlook for inflation across the world following signs of mounting economic weakness and collapsing commodity prices.

"The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability," the banks said. "Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted."

People familiar with the discussions said the central bankers were hoping to maximise the impact of their move as governments were reacting to the crisis with unco-ordinated moves.

The Fed cut rates from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent; the ECB cut its policy rate to 3.75 per cent; the Bank of England to 4.5 per cent; the Swiss National Bank to 2.5 per cent and Sweden's Riksbank to 4.25 per cent.

 SEGLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS   HDMonetary chiefs in historic harmony   BYGuha, Krishna    WC626 words   PD9 October 2008   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   EDLondon Ed2   PG09   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPCentral Banks

Krishna Guha explains why the co-ordinated transatlantic cuts in interest rates make sense
   TDYesterday's interest rate cut by six central banks in North America and Europe is a historic move that attempts to produce for the first time a comprehensive international monetary policy response to the economic risks of the credit crisis.

The transatlantic move marks a recognition that growth had already weakened across the industrialised world even before the latest escalation of financial stress.

The combination of an increasingly global downturn, plus global financial stress, raises the likelihood of rising unemployment in leading economies and has already depressed commodity prices, making the inflation outlook less worrying.

Policymakers see the danger that the feedback loop between financial sector weakness and economic weakness that has menaced the US since the start of the credit squeeze may now be replicating at global level.

Since the financial markets are global, the threat to growth is global, and falling commodity prices are global, it makes sense to address the economic risks through global monetary easing.

The Federal Reserve, Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank and the Swedish Riksbank would in any case have moved in convoy to ease rates in the coming weeks.

China's move - and the rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia this week - further strengthens the notion that this is a truly global effort. However, for the six central banks to act as one has a number of advantages.

First, by acting simultaneously, the central banks maximised the chance that their actions might shock the credit markets back to life and bolster collapsing confidence among households and businesses.

By contrast, Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, was sceptical that a Fed rate cut on its own, which was already priced into the market, would do very much to boost growth or ease market stress.

Second, the co-ordinated nature of the move made it less embarrassing for central banks to U-turn on rates - particularly the ECB, but also the Bank of England and the Fed, which adopted a neutral balance of risks at its last policy meeting.

Third, it avoided the risk that one-at-a-time rate cuts would produce disorderly swings in currency markets. This was a particular concern for the Fed and the Bank of England, since the dollar and sterling have both suffered bouts of extreme weakness since the credit crisis began.

The ECB did not want to see the euro swing higher against the dollar even on a temporary basis following a Fed emergency rate cut.

Fourth, it reassured the markets that the world's central banks were operating in harmony, at a moment when governments around the world were adopting emergency actions - such as bank deposit guarantees or recapitalisation plans - that were plainly not co-ordinated and often had harmful spillover effects.

In particular, the central banks were signalling that there would be no "beggar-thy-neighbour" efforts at competitive devaluation.

Pulling this off was no mean feat.

Since the start of the credit crisis the world's central banks, in particular the Fed and the ECB, have appeared to take a different approach to dealing with the danger.

Yesterday's joint action represents a globalisation of the Federal Reserve's strategy of using rate cuts to ease or at least offset what would otherwise be a tightening of financial conditions in order to reduce danger to the world economy from the credit crisis.

It also respects the ECB separation principle, since the rate cuts are explicitly targeted at the economy rather than the financial system, and are justified by the change in inflation outlook.

 * Federal Reserve cut rates twice in January 2008 by 75 and 50 basis points
respectively
 + Reserve Bank of India raised the repo rate twice in June 2008, to 8.0 percent
on June 11 and 8.5 percent on June 24.

 NOTES:

 If rates change more than once a month, the last rate for that month is
listed.

 1. On March 9, 2006 the BOJ said it would no longer set a target for the
amount of surplus funds in the money market, ending its "quantitative easing"
policy, and adopted a more conventional tactic of guiding the unsecured
overnight call rate. On July 14, 2006 it raised interest rates for the first
time in six years.

 2. The Swiss National Bank targets a range for the three-month Swiss franc
LIBOR rate. It currently targets roughly the midpoint of that range.

 3. Table shows the Bank of Mexico's overnight lending rate. This replaces
monthly averages of yields on 28-day Cetes treasury bills at weekly open market
operations, as shown in past tables. 

 4. On Jan. 17, 2007 the Bank of Thailand set a new policy rate based on the
1-day repurchase rate <BOT15>, instead of the 14-day rate. The rate was set at
4.75 percent, compared with the market close that day of 4.9375 percent.
Comparison in the table for the end of 2006 shows the 14-day rate.

     * In a dramatic, early morning move the Federal Reserve joined 
other major central banks in slashing interest rates in a further effort 
to deal with an intensifying financial crisis and counter growing 
recession dangers. The Fed cut both its federal funds rate and discount 
rate by 50 basis points. The European Central Bank also eased by 50 
basis points, as did the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, the 
Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank. The Bank of Japan 
expressed "its strong support of these policy actions." 

     * The credit markets, still absorbing the Wednesday morning news of 
coordinated central bank rate cuts, were hit with a big surprise at 
10:30 ET, a string of Treasury note reopenings to combat settlement 
fails that dumped enough supply to immediately spike interest rates 
higher. With only about 10 minutes warning, Treasury officials descended 
on the department's press room to tell reporters of imminent reopenings 
of "multiple securities" to cure settlement fails, described as "severe 
dislocations in the market causing acute, protracted shortages." The 
announcement was accompanied by the declaration that Treasury, the SEC, 
the CFTC, the Federal Reserve board and the New York Fed are calling 
meetings with securities firms, those which are members of SIFMA and the 
Treasury Markets Practices Group, "to clearly and definitively identify 
remedies to prevent a reoccurrence of these situations." 

     * U.S. Stocks: Despite the co-ordinated interest rate cuts seen 
earlier, U.S. stocks moved lower initially Wednesday morning, with the 
Dow Industrials and Nasdaq Composite both down 2.7% at one point. Later 
in afternoon action, U.S. stocks rebounded, but could not maintain 
positive gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.00% or 
189 points at 9,258.10 and the Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.83% or 15 
points at 1,740.33  

     * The coordinated rate cuts by major central banks early Wednesday 
is a "step in the right direction" towards a policy package to help 
resolve the financial crisis, though more may be needed, and certainly 
more policies aimed at the financial sector specifically, a senior 
International Monetary Fund official said. Newly-installed IMF chief 
economist Olivier Blanchard, unveiling his first World Economic Outlook, 
said the dismal baseline forecast has significant downside risks, but 
also assumes governments will step in to take action to stabilize 
financial markets. 

     * Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson Wednesday pledged that the 
Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation will all their resources to get credit markets back to 
normal to staunch economic weakness. Paulson said it will be "several 
weeks" before the Treasury can begin buying bad assets under authority 
given it by Congress last Friday, and so he said "it's too early" to 
expect encouraging credit market developments. And he said he could not 
predict when the economy will recover -- only that it will. 

     * Seldom known for its cheerfulness, the economic staff of the 
International Monetary Fund issued its gloomiest World Economic Outlook 
in memory Wednesday. The IMF's semi-annual WEO -- revised until the last 
moment to incorporate the latest dreary developments in global financial 
markets -- warned of "a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous 
financial shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s." The WEO 
sharply reduced its economic growth forecast and said even those reduced 
projections are subject to "considerable downside risks" in an 
"exceptionally uncertain" climate. 

     * The Fed announced it is allowing insurance giant AIG to replenish 
its liquidity by borrowing up to $37.8 bln in investment-grade 
fixed-income securities from AIG in return for cash collateral. 
Drawdowns to date from the original $85 bln Fed loan to AIG have been 
used to settle transactions with these third party securities, so now 
AIG will have another nearly $40 billion in cash. 

     * Analysts who were expecting a U.S. recession prior to Wednesday's 
coordinated rate cuts by major central banks worldwide, still do expect 
the economy to worsen before it gets better. The central banks' actions, 
including a 50-basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, did not even 
change the outlook for the scope or length of a recession in the U.S. 
Part of the reason is that several analysts had already factored in 
monetary policy easing in the U.S., although the timing wazs different 
from forecasts. 
    
     * The volume of large loan commitments and credits rose 22.6% to 
$2.8 trillion based on data provided as of the end of December 2007, the 
Federal Reserve, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office 
of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
reported Wednesday. The report reflects annual trends and does not show 
whether the pace of credit growth decelerated in the second half of the 
year, after the credit bubble burst in the summer of 2007. 

     * U.S. Treasuries ended lower Wednesday, although off the day's 
absolute lows, amid surprising news of reopening auctions. That news 
followed coordinated rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of 
Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Swiss 
National Bank and the Swedish central bank. The cash 2-year note yield 
ended at 1.617% by 3:00 p.m. ET Wednesday, from 1.497% by 3:00 p.m. ET 
Tuesday. The 5-year yield was at 2.708% from 2.481%. The 10-year yield 
was at 3.717% from 3.508%. The 30-year bond was at 4.062% from 4.026%.                 
The 2-year/5-year curve steepened to +109.1 bps from  +98.4 bps. The 
2-year/10-year steepened to +210.0 bps from +201.1 bps, while the 
2-year/30-year flattened to +244.5 bps from +252.9 bps.

 HDAnalysis: China Joins Global Response To Crisis With Rate Cut   WC718 words   PD8 October 2008   ET14:21   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.   
   TD

     BEIJING (MNI) - The People's Bank of China joined other major 
central banks Wednesday in announcing an interest rate cut as the 
world's financial authorities mobilized to head off an ongoing crisis in 
the credit markets. 

     The PBOC said that it will cut the one-year deposit and lending 
rates by 27 basis points each effective Thursday. It also announced a 50 
basis point reduction in the commercial bank reserve requirement 
effective October 15. 

     That marks the second time in three weeks that the central bank has 
lowered rates and the reserve requirement. 

     Analysts said that the timing of the move -- which came as the 
Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and other major central banks 
were also announcing rate cuts -- was clearly intended to show that 
China is joining the global response to the credit crisis. 

     "A cut was expected, the timing was not, but it reflects 
coordinated global easing," said Ben Simpfendorfer, a strategist with 
the Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. 
 
     Speculation had been growing that China would lower interest rates 
again, particularly with the approach of a high-level Communist Party 
meeting, which begins Thursday, and the release of third quarter 
economic data which is scheduled for October 21. 

     The government had been emboldened by four months of falling 
consumer price inflation to reduce the benchmark one-year lending rate 
by 27 basis points on September 16 and the reserve requirement by 100 
basis points on September 25. 

     So far, China has been relatively insulated from the turmoil which 
has paralyzed the global credit markets, thanks largely to its closed 
capital account and relatively unsophisticated financial system. Its 
banks have also disclosed only limited exposure to failed U.S. financial 
institutions.       

     While neither public nor private sector Chinese firms have  
participated in the merger and acquisition activities in the U.S. and 
Europe, Premier Wen Jiabao did suggest in a television interview at the 
end of last month that Beijing would be involved in responding to the 
crisis. 
     
     "Now, cooperation is everything," Wen said in an interview taped in 
New York. "We should join hands and meet the crisis together." 

     But China's economy no longer exists in a vacuum, and government 
fear levels about the impact of the world economic slowdown on Chinese 
growth have risen constantly since the end of the first half of the 
year. Easing price pressure have also increased Beijing's room to act. 

     The unprecendented events of the past two weeks only sharpened 
those fears, with government officials slashing their outlooks for 
economic growth. 

     Third quarter data is expected to show continued disinflation but 
also weakening export and investment activity as the world slowdown 
takes its toll. 

     Purchasing manager's indexes released at the start of the month 
showed China's manufacturing sector contracting, or near contraction, 
while the Market News International China Business Sentiment Survey, 
released at the end of September, came in at its second lowest reading 
in the survey's history on the back of slumping new order growth. 

     "China's economic challenges appear to be mounting, necessitating 
further monetary easing as well as more aggressive fiscal spending," 
said Jing Ulrich, head of China equities at JPMorgan in Hong Kong in a 
note to clients. 

     One source familiar with State Council discussions told Market News 
International earlier this week that growth could slow to 9.0% to 9.5% 
this year and to 8.0% in 2009, compared with the 11.9% expansion 
recorded in 2007. 

     The government is now expected to continue easing monetary policy 
through the end of this year -- with RBS's Simpfendorfer expecting one 
more cut before 2009 -- while fiscal incentives are also expected to be 
used increasingly to stimulate internal demand. 

     The Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday, shortly after the rate 
cut announcement, that the government is suspending the 5% tax on 
deposit interest income. 

     In the coming weeks, it is also expected to approve a plan to shift 
to a consumption-based value-added tax from the current production-based 
tax system. Economists consider that an expansionary move as it would 
reduce corporate tax burdens and boost investment.

--BOC Lowers Rate In Concert With Five Central Banks 

By Courtney Tower

     OTTAWA (MNI) - The Bank of Canada early Thursday lowered its key 
policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.5%, in concert with the 
United States Federal Reserve and four other central banks. 

     An early morning announcement said the concerted action "will 
provide timely and significant support to the Canadian economy," and the 
Bank stands ready to provide further action if required. The Bank's next 
scheduled announcement date for announcing the target for the overnight 
rate is October 21, and a full update of the Banks outlook for economic 
growth and inflation comes October 23 in a Monetary Policy Report. 

     The Bank said "inflation expectations remain well anchored." Total 
inflation in Canada is running at 3.5 percent and core inflation at 
1.7%. 

     The BOC's announcement, along with those of the Federal Reserve 
System of the U.S., Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central 
Bank, Swiss National Bank and Sveriges Riksbank, said "the recent 
intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks 
to growth" while diminishing the upside risks to price stability. 
Inflation in the world is less of a concern now as energy and other 
commodity prices have tumbled. 

     With the sharp deterioration in world financial markets, further 
weakening of the U.S. economy and abrupt declines in commodity prices, 
"credit conditions in Canada have tightened significantly, despite the 
health of our financial institutions," the Bank said. Growth of domestic 
consumer and business demand will suffer and net exports will fall. The 
recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar will help cushion the 
negative effects, but "will not completely offset them," the Bank said.

     TOKYO (MNI) - The Bank of Japan on Wednesday said it "strongly 
supports" coordinated interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and 
five other central banks, but stressed that the BOJ has no reason to 
lower already "very low" interest rates in Japan. 

     The BOJ said its answer to helping fight the global credit crunch 
is to supply ample liquidity in the short-term money market in yen and 
dollars. BOJ officials have said real interest rates in Japan are in 
negative territory and thus remain stimulative to the struggling 
economy. 
   
     The bank will also consider "possible ways" to further boost the 
impact of its monetary operations, including the use of its reserve 
system, it said in a statement. 
                           
     The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, 
the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank 
jointly announced on Wednesday that they were reducing interest rates. 
                                                              
     The following is the BOJ's statement issued at the same time. 

     "The Bank of Japan welcomes the policy decisions made by six 
central banks and hopes that these actions will contribute to securing 
the stability of both the financial systems and economies of these 
countries. 

     "In Japan, policy interest rates are very low and the monetary 
conditions remain accommodative. On top of that, the Bank has engaged 
itself in decisive actions of liquidity supply, ranging from the 
uninterrupted provision of ample yen liquidity in the market to the 
introduction of US dollar liquidity operations. Against this background, 
Japan's financial market has been stable in comparison with those in 
other industrialized countries. 

     "It is of utmost importance for every central bank to maintain 
stability of financial markets amidst the ongoing financial turmoil. The 
Bank of Japan will continue to do its best to secure the stability of 
financial markets through money market operations while staying in close 
cooperation with other central banks. From this perspective, Governor of 
the Bank of Japan has instructed its staff to swiftly examine possible 
ways to further enhance the effectiveness of monetary operations, 
including those pertaining to BOJ reserve system."

 HDAnalysts: Coord Rate Cuts Not Changing US Recession Prospects   WC539 words   PD8 October 2008   ET19:36   SNMarket News International   SCMARNEW   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008. Market News International, Inc.

By Yali N'Diaye

     WASHINGTON (MNI) - Analysts who were expecting a U.S. recession 
prior to Wednesday's coordinated rate cuts by major central banks 
worldwide, still do expect the economy to worsen before it gets better. 

     The central banks' actions, including a 50-basis point rate cut by 
the Federal Reserve, did not even change the outlook for the scope or 
length of a recession in the U.S. 

     Part of the reason is that several analysts had already factored in 
monetary policy easing in the U.S., although the timing wazs different 
from forecasts. 

     "I was expecting a rate cut from the Fed (although a bit later) and 
the rate cut elsewhere will have minimal effect on the U.S. outlook," 
Insight Economic analyst Steve Wood told Market News International. 

     He anticipates a 1.2% increase in U.S. GDP growth in the fourth 
quarter of 2009 relative to the same quarter this year, and 0.2% on a 
yearly basis. 

     "We are in recession now and have been since the first of the 
year," he continued, expecting it to be "long" and "medium" in its 
magnitude. 

     CIBC World Markets Managing Director and Senior Economist Avery 
Shenfeld sees a U.S. recession only in the second half of this year and 
"it will be short and shallow." 

     He assumes a fiscal stimulus package in early 2009. 

     While the coordinated monetary policy actions on Wednesday have 
"changed our expectations concerning the timing of rate cuts by the 
Fed," said Barclays Capital Senior U.S. Economist Michael S. Hanson, it 
has not changed "our terminal rate over our forecast horizon." 

     In terms of growth expectations, "we have not changed our growth 
forecast at this point," Hanson, who is also anticipating a recession,  
told MNI. 

     He foresees a 0.4% GDP decline year-on-year for 2009, "or 
equivalently grow 0.6% on a Q4-over-Q4 basis," 

     The recession is likely to last from the third quarter of this year 
to the second quarter of 2009, longer than the National Bureau of 
Economic Research (NBER), Hanson predicted. 

     In terms of magnitude, "it will be deeper than the 2001 recession 
but not as deep as the 1990-91 recession, in terms of the peak-to-trough 
decline in GDP (-1.3%)," he continued. 

     Early Wednesday, major central banks announced coordinated interest 
rate cuts, as the worsening of the financial crisis calls for "some 
easing of global monetary conditions." 

     "The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central 
Bank, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National 
Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates. The Bank 
of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions," the 
joint statement said. 

     The Federal Reserve target rate is now at 1.50%. 

     The Bank of Japan, which is already offering very low interest 
rates, did not cut rates but expressed support for the coordinated 
action. 

     We had been expecting the Fed to cut rates at or before their next 
meeting, so the cut is not particularly surprising, Goldman Sachs 
analysts commented in a note.

 HDGold prices jump above $900 after Fed cuts rates   BYBy STEVENSON JACOBS      CRAP Business Writer   WC434 words   PD9 October 2008   ET00:31   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Gold prices shot up above $900 an ounce Wednesday after the Federal Reserve slashed its key interest rate, undercutting the dollar and boosting demand for hard assets as an inflation hedge. Silver also rose.

In a coordinated effort with central banks around the globe, the Fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank also lowered their key rates, as did central banks in China, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland as part of an emergency effort to unclog world credit markets and prevent a global economic collapse.
   TDLower interest rates can boost the economy by making credit cheaper, but they also tend to depress the dollar. That encourages investors to shift money into commodities like gold and silver, which are known for holding their value during times of rising inflation.

Gold for December delivery jumped $24.50 to settle at $906.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier rising as high as $924.90.

Gold has jumped $104 -- or 13 percent -- in the past month as a widening financial crisis batters stock markets across the globe, spurring investors to buy the safe-haven metal.

Still, Jon Nadler, analyst with Kitco Bullion Dealers Montreal, said gold should be trading higher "in the wake of these apparently desperate attempts by officialdom to keep the fabric of the markets from ripping apart."

"Today would be the ideal day to really make a stab at much higher values," Nadler said in a note.

Other precious metals traded mixed.

December silver surged 39.2 cents to settle at $11.772 an ounce, while December copper fell 17.95 cents to settle at $2.355 a pound -- after earlier tumbling to a 19-month low of $2.285.

In energy markets, oil prices closed down Wednesday after touching their lowest level this year, pressured by a huge jump in U.S. crude inventories and more signs of dwindling demand.

Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell $1.11 to settle at $88.95 on the Nymex. Oil at one point fell to $86.05 -- the lowest price since Dec. 6, 2007.

In agriculture trading, grain prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade.

Wheat for December delivery rose 4.75 cents to settle at $6.08 a bushel, while December corn added 10.5 cents to settle at $4.275 a bushel. November soybeans rose 38 cents to settle at $9.64 a bushel.

 HDMeltdown 101: Questions and answers on how a Fed rate cut might help alleviate the crisis   BYBy CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER      CRAP Business Writer   WC818 words   PD8 October 2008   ET23:28   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Will U.S. consumers benefit from the interest rate cuts announced Wednesday by the Federal Reserve and several other countries' central banks?

For most people, probably not much, at least for a while. But people with strong credit could see lower credit card rates soon, and the move could eventually help point the economy in the right direction.
   TDHere are some questions and answers about the interest rate cuts.

Q: Will the rate cuts help fix the financial crisis?

A: Not in the short term, most economists say. The cuts don't directly address the main problem behind the financial meltdown: the reluctance of banks to lend money.

But the coordinated rate cuts might deliver a psychological boost to the financial markets. That's because the cuts mean that once banks do start lending again, many borrowers will be able to get loans at lower rates. That, in turn, could help counter fears that the global economy is on the verge of a steep recession.

The U.S. stock markets weren't immediately encouraged. The Dow fell 189 points Wednesday, or 2 percent, to 9,258, and the S&P 500 dropped 11.3 points, or 1.1 percent, to 984.9.

Q: Why won't the rate cuts have a more immediate effect?

A: Because right now, banks aren't making very many loans at any rate. In today's economic climate, they're worried about borrowers' ability to pay them back. They're also hoarding cash because they lost money on bad mortgages and mortgage-linked investments.

"People who couldn't get loans yesterday ... can't get a loan today," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist for High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm.

Q: What exactly is this rate that was cut?

A: The Fed cut the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans. Cutting it is the Fed's main tool for energizing a sluggish economy. In normal times, a cut in the rate is supposed to ripple through the credit markets, lowering rates for mortgages and auto and other loans. But the effect is likely to be more limited this time, because of banks' reluctance to lend money at all.

Q: So if rate cuts won't quickly turn the credit crisis around, what can?

A: Economists hope the new $700 billion bailout package will encourage banks to offer more loans by removing bad mortgage-related assets from their balance sheets and providing more capital for them to lend.

In addition, the Fed this week said it will buy up huge amounts of short-term debt, known as "commercial paper," that companies use for short-term needs such as payroll. The goal is to jump-start a crucial part of the credit market by making cash available to businesses for their most urgent expenses.

Q: Which consumers should benefit from the rate cut?

A: Credit card users may see some benefit, particularly if they have good credit.

"Within one or two billing cycles, individuals ... should see their interest rates decline," said Keith Leggett, senior economist with the American Bankers Association.

But card issuers may provide those lower rates only to those with the best credit scores, said Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

Borrowing costs should also drop almost immediately for consumers with variable-rate home equity and other loans that are tied to the prime interest rate, which Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and other banks cut by a half point Wednesday.

Q. What about adjustable-rate mortgages?

A. That depends on how your rate is set. Adjustable-rate mortgages tied to Treasury rates are likely to drop as many Treasury yields have fallen in recent weeks, McBride said.

But those that are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, will likely see a "big payment increase" in the next couple of months regardless of the Fed's cut, McBride said.

That's because LIBOR, which is the rate at which big international banks lend to each other, has spiked in recent weeks -- those banks just aren't eager to lend each other money, so they're charging higher rates when they do.

Q: What about people preparing to take on new fixed-rate mortgages?

A: They probably won't see much benefit. Fixed mortgage rates typically track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is set in the bond market. The yield on that note rose by almost a quarter point Wednesday. Fixed mortgage rates have remained above 6 percent for most of the year despite the Fed's previous rate cuts.

 HDStocks zigzag, end lower after emergency rate cut   BYBy JOE BEL BRUNO and TIM PARADIS      CRAP Business Writer   WC1,251 words   PD9 October 2008   ET00:41   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - A stock market empowered by an emergency interest rate cut tried to find some stability Wednesday, rallying several times before another late-day drop left Wall Street down for the sixth straight day. Still, the pullback, while fed by comments from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, was milder than the massive declines of earlier in the week.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index, the market measure most closely followed by traders, fell 1.13 percent -- compared to a 3.85 percent slide Monday and a 5.74 percent drop Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrials fell 189 points, a number that while sizeable was less frightening than the 875 it lost over the first two days this week.
   TDTrading was erratic right from the opening bell, after the Federal Reserve and other leading central banks cut rates in the hope that credit markets would soon relax and that banks would begin lending more freely to businesses and consumers. The Fed lowered the target for its federal funds rate by a half-point to 1.5 percent from 2 percent, saying in a statement that the turmoil in financial markets posed a further threat to an already shaky economy; it was joined in the rate cut by the European Central Bank, Bank of England, The Bank of Canada, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank.

Investors had been hankering for a rate cut, and they were clearly happy with the central banks' actions. However, they were also aware that in the near term, the credit markets remain tied up because banks are reluctant to lend.

That mix of emotions had the major indexes wavering between gains and losses until Paulson in late afternoon said financial markets remain severely strained. He also said it would be several weeks before the government's $700 billion financial rescue plan makes its first purchases of banks' troubled mortgage-backed assets.

Paulson's comments showed how vulnerable the market is, and how it can shoot up or down in minutes. The S&P 500 index, up more than 20 points at 3:35 p.m. EDT, tumbled to a loss of 11 by the 4 p.m. closing bell.

"Until we have some more confidence here it's going to be difficult to sustain any rally," said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates in Bethlehem, Pa. "Unfortunately you probably sell the rallies for a little while until we run out of sellers."

The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 189.01, or 2.00 percent, at 9,258.10 after changing direction 36 times.

Broader stock indicators also fell. The S&P 500 index slid 11.29, or 1.13 percent, to 984.94, and the Nasdaq fell 14.55, or 0.83 percent, to 1,740.33.

With its precipitous drop of the past few weeks, Wall Street is approaching the magnitude of the losses it suffered during the bear market in the early part of this decade. By the time the Dow reached its low of that market, 7,286.27 on Oct. 9, 2002, it had fallen 37.8 percent from its record high close of 11,722.98, set in January 2000.

The Dow has now fallen about 35 percent from the closing high of 14,164.53, reached a year ago Thursday. This week alone, the Dow has lost 1,067 points, or 10.3 percent. It has lost 1,592.56, or 14.68 percent over the past six sessions.

The worries on the Street have been exacerbated by the spread of the U.S. credit problems overseas. Several banks in Europe have had to be bailed out, and earlier this week, the governments of Germany, Ireland and Greece took steps to guarantee private bank deposits.

Moreover, the markets are mindful of the fact that the government's $700 billion financial rescue plan is in its early stages of implementation and will take some time to have an impact on banks' balance sheets.

David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's, said the heavy losses in stock markets around the world signal that markets are determining that the credit crisis won't likely be resolved soon.

"There was a general disregard for risk going on in financial markets around the world, it wasn't just the U.S.," he said. "Now they're waking up to risk."

Investors had been anxious in recent days for a rate cut, and despite the Fed taking other steps this week to help the credit markets. Policymakers unveiled a plan to buy massive amounts of commercial paper, the short-term debt used by companies, in a bid to reanimate the credit markets.

It is likely that stocks won't begin to recover for good until investors are certain the credit markets are functioning in a more normal fashion. There are also severe economic problems including heavy job losses and high unemployment that will also need to show improvement.

The uncertainty in the market has driven investors to buy up anything deemed safe, including gold and government debt. For instance, prices of gold shot up $24.50 to $924.90 -- though still off its record of $1,033.90 in March.

Demand for short-term Treasurys remained high because of their safety; investors are willing to take extremely low returns just to have their money in a secure place. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill, which moves opposite its price, dropped to 0.63 percent from 0.81 percent late Tuesday.

However, longer term Treasury bonds fell because they are considered to be less attractive when the Fed cuts rates. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 3.65 percent from 3.51 percent late Tuesday.

The first third-quarter earnings reports are showing signs of strain on companies, and that is adding more uncertainty to the stock market. After the close Tuesday, Alcoa Inc. said it would conserve cash by suspending its stock buyback program and all non-critical capital projects. The aluminum company's earnings fell 52 percent.

Shares of the company fell $2, or 12 percent, to $14.71, by far the steepest decline among the 30 that comprise the Dow industrials.

Retailers' reports of bleak sales in October appeared to dampen investor sentiment at times.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said sales rose in September but issued a tepid forecast for October. Often discounters do better than other retailers during tough economic times so the forecast from the world's largest retailer caused some worries about overall consumer spending. Wal-Mart fell 29 cents to $54.55.

Luxury retailers turned in a generally weak performance. Saks Inc. fell 96 cents, or 13 percent, to $6.24 after sales fell more than Wall Street had expected.

Declining issues outpaced advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by about 3 to 1, while consolidated volume to a very heavy 8.54 billion shares, compared with 6.84 billion traded Tuesday.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 12.38, or 2.21 percent, to 546.57.

Light, sweet crude fell $1.11 to settle at $88.95 on the Nymex. Oil at one point declined to $86.05 -- its lowest price since December.

   LPDETROIT (AP) - Two of Detroit's automakers welcomed the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate cut on Wednesday, but officials from General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. said the lack of available credit and shattered consumer confidence are still weighing on auto sales.

Mike DiGiovanni, GM's executive director of global market and industry analysis, said the cut in the federal funds rate target may not have an immediate impact, but could help stabilize the markets, get fearful banks to start lending again and get consumers back into showrooms.
   TD"I think it has a psychological impact that the Fed is doing everything it can, and it's also sending those signals to overseas markets," he said. "People need to see stability in the stock market. When they do, I think they'll wade back into the water again."

George Pipas, Ford's top sales analyst, said the Fed has cut the fed funds rate during the past year, dropping from 5.25 percent to the current 1.5 percent. But U.S. auto sales in that period have continued to decline, with September's monthly rate dropping below 1 million for the first time in 15 years.

Sales have dropped as consumer confidence was shaken due to uncertainty in the financial markets, declining home values, and lack of available credit.

"I think we can conclude by that that the die has been cast for the near term," Pipas said. "In other words, for the next several months, it's going to be tough sledding."

Pipas said the global financial market turmoil has made people reluctant to make major purchases such as cars and homes.

"It's not just the supply of loans, it's the demand for loans," he said. "Many people who have bulletproof credit are reluctant to pull the trigger on a significant purchase because of the uncertainty around the question of which way the world's economy is headed."

DiGiovanni said the worldwide economic slowdown has some good side effects. Commodity prices, mainly steel, have dropped, as has the price of oil, and banks likely will return to stricter lending requirements of the past.

"It's pretty scary, but at the end of the day, we'll get through the part of this, which is right now lack of trust and people really worried and overreacting."

In a rare coordinated move, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks from around the world slashed interest rates Wednesday to prevent a mushrooming financial crisis from becoming a global economic meltdown.

The Fed reduced its key rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent. It was joined in the half-point cut by the European Central Bank, Bank of England, The Bank of Canada, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank.

The Fed's action Wednesday was the latest in a long series of moves over the last several weeks that the central bank has taken in coordination with other federal agencies, Congress and the White House to shore up a financial industry stung by bad loans, mounting losses and -- in some cases -- collapse. President Bush signed a $700 billion financial bailout bill into law on Friday.

The Fed's action reversed its current policy on interest rates, which had been to hold them steady out of concern that more cuts would fuel inflation. Since Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues put a stop to interest-rate cuts in June, economic and financial conditions have deteriorated significantly.

 HDPending home sales up 7.4 percent in August   BYBy ALAN ZIBEL      CRAP Business Writer   WC479 words   PD8 October 2008   ET17:05   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Pending home sales rose 7.4 percent from July to August, an unexpected piece of positive news for the battered U.S. housing market.

The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales for existing homes rose to 93.4 from an upwardly revised July reading of 87. The reading was the highest since June 2007.
   TDHome sales are considered pending when the seller has accepted an offer, but the deal has not yet closed. Typically there is a one-to two-month lag before a sale is completed.

Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson/IFR had predicted the index would fall to 84.9.

The index, which sunk to a record low of 83 in March, stood at 85.8 in August 2007.

Sales are picking up in places that have seen the most severe declines in housing prices -- including California, Florida Nevada and Arizona, plus Rhode Island and the Washington, D.C. area, said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist. Still, Yun does not expect home prices to rebound until next year and only expects a modest gain of 2 to 3 percent in 2009.

A major unknown is how the worldwide financial crisis and economic slump will affect the housing market.

Despite numerous efforts by the Federal Reserve to encourage banks to lend more, lenders have kept tight reins on mortgage lending, and average rates on 30-year mortgages have remained over 6 percent for most of the year.

The latest effort by the central bank came Wednesday, when the Fed and six other major central banks around the world slashed interest rates Wednesday in an attempt to prevent a mushrooming financial crisis from becoming a global economic meltdown.

The Fed reduced a key rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent. In Europe, which also has been hard hit by the financial crisis, the Bank of England cut its rate by half a point to 4.5 percent and the European Central Bank sliced its rate by half a point to 3.75 percent. Also cutting rates were the central banks of China, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland.

There's no guarantee, though, that mortgage rates will match the Fed's cut.

That's because long-term interest rates, which influence 30-year mortgages, don't always move in sync with the Fed's action, which lowered the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight loans.

However, the Fed action will reduce borrowing costs almost immediately for U.S. bank customers whose home equity and other floating-rate loans are tied to the prime interest rate. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rate by half a point to 4.5 percent after the Fed announcement.

 HDCentral banks cut base rate to stem crisis   BYBy PAN PYLAS      CRAP Business Writer   WC751 words   PD8 October 2008   ET14:04   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPLONDON (AP) - Six central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, jolted markets Wednesday by cutting interest rates together in an attempt to shore up confidence in the world's crisis-stricken financial system.

The move -- the first coordinated interest rate reduction since one made in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. -- helped stock markets around the world rally off lows earlier in the session.
   TDAll cut by a half-percentage point -- a bold stroke intended to send a strong message and restore confidence, as well as keep the credit crisis from further damaging the wider economy as companies struggle to borrow for everyday and long-term needs. Fearful banks are refusing to lend to one another and markets in commercial paper, or short-term unsecured company debt, have been frozen.

The Fed reduced its key rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent, while the Bank of England cut its base lending rate by half a point to 4.5 percent, and the ECB, which last week decided to keep borrowing costs on hold, cut to 3.75 percent. Other central banks also taking part include the banks of Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland. China also cut but did not join in the group statement that accompanied the decision.

The Wednesday cuts came as markets in Asia and Europe sank amid waning confidence, Britain stepped in to support banks, and Russia closed its main stock market for two days.

"The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability," the six central banks, along with the Bank of Japan, said in a joint statement.

"Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted," the statement added.

Brown, who earlier in the day announced assistance for major British banks, said that the action came because "global problems are best dealt with by global action," Brown told lawmakers at the House of Commons.

"By taking coordinated action as a whole and leading the world in doing so, I believe we can get our banking system on a sound footing, and that is the key to the future," Brown said.

There had been mounting talk in the markets in recent days, especially after the surprise 1 percentage point rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday, that the world's central banks would have to cut interest rates together as stock markets continued to dive.

"We have seen a step up in the financial turmoil this week and the frozen money markets coupled with equity markets required an aggressive response," said Divyang Shah, chief strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

"Given questions over how effective these moves will be in arresting the negative spiral in confidence further rate cuts cannot be ruled out," he added.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief that policy-makers have finally decided to work together on something to address the crisis of confidence gripping financial markets.

The FTSE-100 of leading UK shares was down only 42.45 points, or 0.9 percent, at 4,562.77, having earlier been 5 percent down.

The CAC-40 in Paris, which had been down as much as 9 percent earlier in the session, recouped most of the earlier losses, and was down just 75.35 points, or 2.0 percent, at 3,656.87. The DAX also bounced back and was down 130.85, or 2.5 percent, at 5,195.78, having been as much as 6 percent lower earlier.

"Today's coordinated half point rate cuts from all the major central banks (except Japan, where rates were already just 0.5 percent) will provide at least a temporary boost to confidence but we fear that there is still a lot more work to do," said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics.

The ECB and the BoE are widely tipped to be the most likely to have to cut borrowing costs aggressively again soon, given that their base rates are relatively high.

"Accordingly, we expect today's moves to be the first in a series -- whether coordinated or at scheduled meetings -- with rates eventually falling to 2.5 percent in the UK, 2.0 percent in the euro zone and just 0.5 percent in the U.S.," said Jessop.

 HDFed orders emergency rate cut, other banks follow   BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC971 words   PD8 October 2008   ET13:44   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve, acting in coordination with other global central banking authorities, cut a key U.S. interest rate by half a percentage point Wednesday to steady a teetering economy.

The Fed reduced its key rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent.
   TDIn Europe, which also has been hard hit by the financial crisis, the Bank of England cut its rate by half a point to 4.5 percent, while the European Central Bank sliced its rate to 3.75 percent.

Other central banks also taking part include the banks of Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland.

China also cut its key interest rates Wednesday for a second time in less than one month to stimulate slowing economic growth amid the global credit crisis.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues ratcheted down their key rate by 0.5 percentage point to 1.5 percent. The action revives the central bank's rate-cutting campaign which had been halted in June out of concerns that those low rates would worsen inflation. Since then, however, economic and financial conditions have dangerously deteriorated, forcing the Fed to reverse course.

The fact that the Fed felt it couldn't wait until its regularly scheduled meeting on Oct. 28-29, underscored the urgency of the situation.

The Fed took the action in a coordinated move with other central banks, which also were cutting their rates.

"The pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months," the Fed said "Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit."

Although inflation has been high, the Fed believes that the recent drop in energy prices and the weaker prospects for economic activity have reduced this threat to the economy.

The Wednesday cuts come as markets in Asia and Europe sink amid waning confidence, Britain steps in to support banks, and Russia closes its main stock market for two days.

In addition, the Fed reduced its emergency lending rate to banks by half a percentage point to 1.75 percent. Given the intense credit crisis, banks have been ramping up their borrowing from the Fed's emergency "discount" window.

In response, the prime lending rate for millions of borrowers will drop by a corresponding amount. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans.

The hope was to spur nervous consumers and businesses to spend more freely again. They clamped down as housing, credit and financial problems intensified last month, throwing Wall Street into chaos. Many believe the country is on the brink of, or already in, its first recession since 2001.

The Fed's last rate cut was in late April, capping one of the most aggressive rate-cutting campaigns in decades as it scrambled to shore up the faltering economy. After that, the Fed moved to the sidelines, holding rates steady as zooming food and energy prices during that period threatened to ignite inflation. In the past few months, energy prices have retreated from record highs reached in mid-July, giving the Fed more leeway to drop rates again.

At its last meeting in September, the Fed struck a more dire tone about the economy, hinting that a rate reduction once again could be in the offing.

Even with the unprecedented $700 billion financial bailout quickly signed into law by President George W. Bush on Friday, the failing economy and the jobs market probably will get worse. Many believe the economy will jolt into reverse later this year -- if it hasn't already-- and will stay sickly well into next year.

One of the most crucial pillars of the economy -- the jobs market -- has cracked, and wage growth is slowing. This means that consumers will be even more hard-pressed to spend in the fashion that helps grow the economy.

Increasingly skittish employers slashed payrolls by 159,000 in September, the most in more than five years. A staggering 760,000 jobs have disappeared so far this year. The unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, up sharply from 4.7 percent a year ago.

The unemployment rate could hit 7 or 7.5 percent by late 2009. If that happens, it would mark the highest rate of joblessness since the months immediately following the 1990-91 recession. Some economists say the jobless rate could rise even more before the situation starts to get better.

Mounting job losses, shrinking paychecks, shriveling nest eggs and rising foreclosures all have weighed heavily on American voters. The economy is their No. 1 concern, polls have shown.

Spooked consumers and businesses have pulled back so much that some analysts fear the economy stalled -- or even worse, shrank -- in the July-to-September quarter. Many predict the economy will contract in both the final quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year, meeting the classic definition of a recession.

The financial crisis that intensified in September is forcing a seismic shake-up on Wall Street.

Lehman Brothers, the country's fourth-largest investment bank, filed for bankruptcy protection. A weakened Merrill Lynch, deciding it couldn't go it alone anymore, found help in the arms of Bank of America. American International International Group was thrown a financial lifeline. And, the last two investment houses -- Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- decided to convert themselves into commercial banks to better weather the financial storm. The number of banks that have failed this year are up sharply from last year. On Friday, Wachovia Corp. said it will be acquired by Wells Fargo & Co. wiping out Wachovia's previous plan to sell its banking operations to rival suitor Citigroup Inc.

 HDEuro, pound up as central banks coordinate cuts   BYBy GEORGE FREY      CRAP Business Writer   WC350 words   PD8 October 2008   ET14:32   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The euro and British pound both gained on the dollar Wednesday after six central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, announced coordinated interest rate cuts Wednesday.

The 15-nation euro rose to US$1.3691 from the US$1.3550 it bought Wednesday morning and the US$1.3645 a euro bought late Tuesday in New York.
   TDThe British pound bought US$1.7530, up from the US$1.7465 Wednesday morning and the US$1.7510 late Tuesday in New York.

In a surprise coordinated announcement released at 1100GMT, the European Central Bank said it would cut its benchmark rate by half a point to 3.75 percent on Wednesday. In London, the Bank of England lowered its rate to 4.5 percent from 5 percent.

The cuts were part of a globally organized effort that also included the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

"Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets," the European Central Bank said in a statement.

"Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices," it added. "The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability."

In Stockholm, Nordea analyst Annika Winsth said the decision was not unexpected and was "totally right and proper."

"It is an important signal to the market that the central banks are prepared to come together to do what they can to ease the situation," she said.

In other trading the dollar was up against the Japanese yen, buying 100.73, compared with 100.28 yen Wednesday morning but down from the 101.71 yen a dollar bought late Tuesday in New York.

 HDFed slashes interest rates, but stocks lose again   BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,003 words   PD9 October 2008   ET00:19   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Wall Street bounced higher and lower Wednesday trying to make up its mind about an unprecedented coordinated interest rate cut by central banks around the world. In the end it settled on a familiar feeling -- fear -- and plunged again.

The Federal Reserve, desperately trying to jump-start the lending that keeps the U.S. economy moving, dropped its closely watched federal funds rate to 1.5 percent. The cut from 2 percent took the rate to its lowest level in more than four years.
   TDCentral banks in England, China, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank also cut rates after a series of high-stakes phone calls over several days among Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his counterparts.

But the Dow Jones industrial average lost another 189 points, or 2 percent, to close at 9,258. It was the sixth consecutive day of losses for the Dow. The index has shed more than a third of its value, nearly 5,000 points, since its all-time high, set one year ago Thursday.

The day's losses were lighter for the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500. And Wall Street as a whole fared far better than Asia, where some stock exchanges were down 9 percent, and Europe, where some lost 5 percent.

The Fed acted in concert with the European Central Bank to make emergency interest rate cuts after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001. But Wednesday's cuts were unprecedented with the number of nations that participated, the Fed said.

For millions of Americans, the Fed's cut means that borrowing money becomes cheaper. Home equity loans, credit cards and other floating-rate loans fluctuate depending on what the Fed does.

Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rates by half a point to 4.5 percent, also the lowest in more than four years, after the Fed announced its decision early Wednesday.

Fed watchers believe the central bank might cut rates further when it meets late this month, and perhaps again in December, in hopes of cushioning the blow should the United States fall into recession.

"Even if the financial crisis was put to bed today, that would still leave the economy in a probable recession," said economist Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.

One day after a presidential debate that focused heavily on the economy, both major candidates embraced the decision. Both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain described the crisis as global.

The White House welcomed the cooperation among central banks to battle the crisis. "It's important and helpful that central banks are working in a coordinated way to deal with stress in the financial system," spokesman Tony Fratto said.

Even the coordinated action may not break the panicky mindset that has gripped investors across the world as jobs evaporate and retirement savings dry up. Banks may still be inclined to hoard cash, and until they decide to lend again the crisis is not likely to let up.

If anyone needed evidence, major American retailers turned in dismal sales figures for the third quarter, further proof that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, is sputtering.

"The turmoil will not end quickly, and significant challenges remain ahead," Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters at a preview of meetings this week of the finance officials of the Group of Seven major industrial countries, the 185-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The global credit crisis was expected to be the major agenda item at those talks.

Paulson spoke after Asian and European markets wrapped up a bleak day, with investors fleeing stocks and worrying that neither the Fed nor other central banks could move fast enough to stop the turmoil, even considering the $700 billion U.S. bailout of financial institutions.

European indexes ended lower, too. Britain's FTSE-100 finished down about 5.2 percent, Germany's DAX about 5.9 percent and France's CAC-40 6.3 percent.

In Asia, where trading ended for the day before the rate cuts were announced, the Japanese Nikkei 225 closed down more than 9 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng more than 8 percent.

In Britain, the government said it would pour cash into troubled banks in exchange for stakes in them -- a partial nationalization.

"This is not a time for conventional thinking or outdated dogma but for the fresh and innovative intervention that gets to the heart of the problem," said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer suggested the United States take similar steps.

The Fed's interest rate cut was a change in course. It had held rates steady because of inflation concerns. Since the Fed had put a stop to interest-rate cuts in June, the economic outlook has deteriorated.

"The pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months," the Fed said. "Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit."

Although inflation has been running higher, the Fed believes the recent drop in prices for oil and gas, and the weaker prospects for economic activity, have reduced the threat inflation poses to the economy.

The credit markets, which have been remarkably tight for weeks, showed only small signs of loosening. Rates on commercial paper, the short-term debt companies issue to raise cash for everyday expenses, went down. But the rate banks charge each other for loans went up.

The Fed also reduced its emergency lending rate to banks by half a percentage point, to 1.75 percent. Given the intense credit crisis, banks have been borrowing more under what is known as the discount window.

 HDFed makes emergency move to lend directly to companies; Bernanke hints at rate cuts soon   BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,127 words   PD8 October 2008   ET04:17   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve reached deeper into its bag of tricks Tuesday to slow the financial crisis. Wall Street was not amused.

Frantically trying to thaw frozen lending and get the economy moving again, the Fed for the first time said it would lend directly to businesses that aren't banks and hinted that it could slash interest rates soon.
   TDStocks continued their free fall anyway. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 500 points, to its lowest level in more than five years, and the Standard & Poor's 500 fell below 1,000 for the first time since 2003.

Investors remain worried that the financial contagion has spread around the world so far, so fast, that not even the mighty Fed can't stop it.

In a speech to the National Association for Business Economics, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke delivered a strong signal interest rates may need to be cut. And he warned the country could be stuck in the economic doldrums for some time.

"The outlook for economic growth has worsened," Bernanke said. "The heightened financial turmoil that we have experienced of late may well lengthen the period of weak economic performance."

The gloomy assessment appeared to open the door wider to an interest rate cut on or before the Fed convenes again Oct. 28. The Fed's key interest rate now stands at 2 percent.

Wall Street turned its back. The Dow Jones industrials lost 508 points, more than 5 percent, to close at 9,447, the lowest since Sept. 30, 2003. The Standard & Poor's 500, a broader stock index, closed below 1,000 for the first time since that same day.

The economic crisis was a major focus of a second presidential debate Tuesday night between Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama. During sharp exchanges with Obama, McCain called for a far-reaching program to stem foreclosures by requiring the federal government to renegotiate the mortgages of individual homeowners and make them more affordable.

"It's my proposal. It's not Sen. Obama's proposal," McCain, R-Ariz., said at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn.

Obama charged that the current crisis was the "final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years" that President Bush pursued and were "supported by Sen. McCain."

He contended that Bush, McCain and others had favored deregulation of the financial industry, predicting that would "let markets run wild and prosperity would rain down on all of us. It didn't happen."

Bush again sought to strike a reassuring tone and said the nation would make it through an economy blighted by job losses, record foreclosures and shriveled retirement savings. Congress' top budget analyst estimated Tuesday that Americans' retirement plans have lost as much as $2 trillion in 15 months.

"Have faith, this economy is going to recover over time," the president said in a speech in Virginia. "I wish I could snap my fingers and make what happened stop. But that's not the way it works."

Bush reached out to European leaders earlier Tuesday to urge coordination on efforts to solve the crisis. The White House said Bush was open to the idea of a summit.

The financial crisis has spread overseas. EU finance ministers held an emergency meeting Tuesday in Luxembourg to debate raising guarantees for private savings across the bloc.

Germany pledged to guarantee all private bank savings and CDs in the country, and Iceland and Denmark followed suit. Ireland went even further by also guaranteeing Irish banks' debts. Iceland's prime minister went as far as saying his country is facing the prospect of bankruptcy.

Britain's chief financial regulator was readying a statement to make before markets opened Wednesday, and the BBC reported that the British government was poised to announce a rescue package for the banking system there.

Concerns are mounting that a global recession is developing, and pressure is growing on the U.S. government to do something beyond the $700 billion financial bailout package that Bush signed into law Friday.

To that end, the Fed announced it would begin buying companies' short-term debt -- the first time it has used the Depression-era power outside the financial system.

The government's $700 billion bailout package was aimed at thawing lending by buying bad mortgage-related debt off the books of troubled financial institutions. The idea is that the banks would then be in a better position to lend and get the economy moving.

Commercial paper borrowing usually ranges from overnight to less than a week. But in the current climate of mistrust, the market has dried up considerably.

The action makes the Fed a crucial source of credit for nonfinancial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms -- and also exposes it to risk because so much of the debt would not be backed by collateral.

Credit markets, clenched up for weeks now, relaxed somewhat after the Fed's move.

The Fed said it was creating a new entity to buy two types of short-term debt, known as three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper, directly from eligible companies. It hopes to have the program up and running soon, Fed officials said.

Fed officials said they would buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again but refused to say how much that might be. They noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify.

The Treasury Department, which worked with the Fed on the program, said the action was "necessary to prevent substantial disruptions to the financial markets and the economy."

The Treasury will provide money to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to support the new program, the Fed said. The money would be separate from the $700 billion financial bailout package.

The Fed said it planned to stop buying the short-term debt on April 30 but may extend the program.

There was $1.6 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of last week, the most recent data from the Fed. The market has shrunk from $2.2 trillion last summer.

By Lesley Wroughton and Emily Kaiser

WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund, in its bleakest forecast in years, said on Wednesday the world economy was set for a major downturn with the United States and Europe either in or on the brink of recession.

The IMF said the worst financial trauma since the Great Depression would exact a heavy economic toll as investors wrestle with a crisis of confidence and a credit crunch.

"The world economy is now entering a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s," the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook.

The assessment was written before a coordinated interest-rate cut of a half-percentage point on Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Switzerland, Canada and Sweden.

China also joined the move with a more modest cut.

The IMF's new chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said the coordinated drive was a step in the right direction, but more action may be needed as the world economy slows.

"Fifty basis points is not nothing," Blanchard told a news conference. But he said monetary policy was only part of the answer and further measures were needed to clear up clogged credit markets. "More is needed, in particular in Europe," he said.

In an interview with Reuters, Blanchard said the rash of crises in recent weeks had convinced world policy-makers that it was time to work together to find a way out of the credit turmoil, which has raged for 14 months.

"Events focus the mind," Blanchard said. "What's absolutely essential to solve this financial crisis is the perception by the public and by the markets that there is a coherent plan."

WORKING TO AVERT DEPRESSION

In its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF slashed its 2009 forecast for world growth to 3 percent, which would be the slowest pace in seven years, from a July projection of 3.9 percent, and warned that a recovery would be unusually slow.

It said growth this year would come in at 3.9 percent, a touch below the 4.1 percent it projected in July.

While the world economy was unusually frail, Blanchard told reporters there was little chance of a global depression, provided leaders adopt policies to address market distress.

"If the right policies are in place, then the probability of a 'Great Depression' is extremely small," he said.

Blanchard said leaders in Europe were having "some difficulty" agreeing on how to deal with the crisis but the financial markets were forcing them to move quickly.

If they succeed, "the risk of a 'Great Depression' is nearly nil," he added.

CRISIS SPREADS; EMERGING ECONOMIES HIT

The IMF blamed lax economic and regulatory policies for the current woes, saying they probably allowed the global economy to "exceed its speed limit." At the same time, market flaws combined with policy shortcomings to allow stresses to build.

Now, the world is about to pay the price.

The IMF had believed developing economies could largely steer clear of any painful spillover from the credit mess, but no longer. In its latest report, the global economic watchdog warned emerging and developing economies are also slowing, in some cases to rates well below trend.

The immediate challenge for policy-makers is to stabilize credit markets, while nursing economies through the global downturn and keeping inflation under control, the fund said.

IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said more coordinated steps would be warranted to remove distressed assets from banks' balance sheets and to protect depositors.

"This is the right course of action in the face of the deflationary impact of the major financial shock in mature markets and against a background of declining inflation pressures," Strauss-Kahn said in a statement.

World Bank President Robert Zoellick said China's participation in the action was part of a process in which it was becoming a constructive stakeholder in the world economy.

Zoellick this week said the Group of Seven industrial nations was not broad enough to deal with the magnitude of the crisis, and called for a broader grouping of countries that included China and other emerging economic powers.

But Zoellick also said coordinated action was needed to help vulnerable, poor countries that will be hit by a crisis that was not of their own making. He said the World Bank had identified about 30 of these countries who would need help.

"We will play a role, but we need the developed countries to also act in a coordinated way to support that," he added.

U.S. SCREECHES TO HALT

Meanwhile, the IMF said the U.S. economy was screeching to a halt and warned a recession was increasingly likely.

For all of next year, it projects U.S. growth of just 0.1 percent. The near-term course of the U.S. economy, the IMF said, will largely depend on the effectiveness of recent government initiatives to combat the spreading credit crisis.

In Europe, the crisis has stalled growth, and interest-rate cuts and decisive government action to restore confidence to prevent a lasting slowdown are needed, the report said.

The fund said growth in the euro zone was set to slow to 1.3 percent in 2008, easing to a scant 0.2 percent in 2009.

Asian powers China and India will also experience slower growth due to weaker exports, but should continue to be supported by solid private consumption, it said.

Growth in China is likely to come in at 9.7 percent this year and 9.3 percent in 2009 -- compared to 11.9 percent in 2007, the IMF said. India will grow 7.9 percent this year and slow to 6.9 percent in 2009, it said. (Editing by Tom Hals and Jan Paschal)

By Daniel Trotta and Kevin Krolicki

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Central banks around the world cut interest rates in unison on Wednesday in an unprecedented move that failed to boost battered stocks, thaw credit markets or cushion forecasts for a sharp slowdown.

U.S. stocks closed down for a sixth straight session after heavy trade that saw gains fade in the last hour. Trading was extremely volatile amid uncertainty about whether the lower interest rates would avert recession.

The S&P 500 index closed down 1 percent and has shed 15 percent since the start of the month. Wall Street's benchmark of fear, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, hit a record high as investors scrambled for cover in the event of a continued slump.

"Confidence has been lost and it's difficult to regain," said Ian Nakamoto, director of research at MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier in Toronto.

Prices for oil and other commodities fell as investors rolled back to cash and gold -- safe havens in fear-wracked markets.

"The key is confidence, confidence, confidence. And until we get some change there, the atmosphere for gold is going to continue to be very positive," said Bill O'Neill, partner at LOGIC Advisors in New Jersey.

The coordinated rate cuts were the latest salvo from financial policymakers in response to a worldwide crisis that has unsettled investors, toppled banks and reshaped the U.S. presidential election.

Europe's financial sector was also in turmoil with Britain saying it was prepared to inject 50 billion pounds ($87 billion) of taxpayer money into its banks.

Italy also approved a financial plan, saying it would take shares in any banks recapitalized with government funds.

Iceland took over two of its largest banks, abandoned support for its withering currency and sought an emergency loan from Russia.

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its key federal funds rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 percent and China, the European Central Bank and central banks in Britain, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland followed suit.

The coordinated cuts included China for the first time. The Bank of Japan said it saw no need to cut Japanese interest rates but that it strongly supported the coordinated action.

Earlier, Hong Kong slashed its main interest rate by a full percentage point to match a similar cut by Australia a day earlier.

"The central banks of the world finally woke up to the gravity of the current situation," said Charles Diebel, head of interest rates strategy at Nomura. "This is a major step in convincing the world that they are serious about stabilizing."

Stocks had remained under pressure even after the United States approved a $700 billion rescue plan to buy distressed debt from financial institutions so they can clean up their balance sheets and start lending again.

In the immediate wake of the easing by the Fed, U.S. credit markets still showed signs of distress.

A widely watched spread between interbank lending rates and 3-month U.S. Treasury bills, seen as a proxy for the risk appetite of banks, blew out to its widest range in at least a decade before easing back in afternoon trade.

The move underscored intense underlying concern about the global banking system even after the interest rate cuts.

U.S. government debt prices fell, sending yields higher as the market recoiled from a flurry of new debt supply with the United States preparing to finance its bank rescue.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson urged stepped-up international cooperation ahead of Friday's gathering in Washington of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven: the United States, Canada, Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Japan.

But he also warned that the turmoil "will not end quickly" and said it might be several weeks before the Treasury begins buying up bad debt from banks.

"I'm looking to take all the steps that we need to take to stabilize the financial system," Paulson said.

With banks still desperately short of U.S. dollars, one analysis suggested the crisis might justify wholesale use of the $4.5 trillion of U.S. currency stashed in global central bank vaults.

As the world's biggest holder of currency reserves, China could also play an important part in calming the storm. China could step up with a vote of confidence in the dollar and even buy more more to help fund the bailout of the U.S. financial system about to get under way, analysts said.

STORMY WEATHER AHEAD

The International Monetary Fund issued its bleakest forecast in years, saying the world economy was set for a major downturn with the United States and Europe either in or on the brink of recession.

U.S. retailers reported disappointing September sales just days after the United States reported losing 159,000 jobs in September, running the year's total to 760,000.

Industry tracking firm Global Insight predicted U.S. auto sales would fall further in 2009 from the 15-year lows the market has hit this year. General Motors shares fell to their lowest since 1952.

The equity sell-off has destroyed some $4.6 trillion of global stock market wealth in the past three weeks alone, according to the market capitalization loss on MSCI's main world equity index.

Over the last 12 months, the figure is more than $12 trillion, of which $7 trillion came from the United States.

The economy has taken center stage in the U.S. presidential campaign less than four weeks to go before the Nov. 4 election. Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama welcomed the global rate cut.

In the second of three debates, McCain on Tuesday promised to buy mortgages from homeowners facing financial problems to help them refinance. His campaign said it would cost roughly $300 billion.

Obama blamed McCain and the Republicans for supporting the deregulation of the financial industry that led to the crisis. He said middle-class workers, not just Wall Street, needed a rescue package that would include tax cuts.

 HDUS RATE FUTURES-Bets placed on 1.25-pct fed funds low   BYBy Ros Krasny      WC466 words   PD8 October 2008   ET22:23   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPCHICAGO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Financial dealers bet that the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on Wednesday will be followed by another at its next scheduled policy meeting late this month but showed limited appetite for an even lower rate.

The Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- surprised many market participants by slashing its benchmark federal funds rate to 1.5 percent from 2.0 percent, the lowest since September 2004.
   TDIn an unprecedented response to turmoil in world financial markets, the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee coordinated the move with five other major central banks.

The Fed's comment that it will "monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed," was seen by some as "code" that another rate cut is imminent.

"It seems as if they're likely to do another 25 basis points in October and a further 25 in December," said Thomas Lam, senior Treasury economist at United Overseas Bank Group in Singapore. There are 100 basis points in a percentage point.

Still, although interest rate futures show an 84-percent perceived chance that the funds rate will be cut to 1.25 percent at the Oct. 28-29 FOMC meeting, bets on a 1-percent funds rate peak at 20 percent for the December meeting.

Lam said rate cuts by the Fed and other banks, part of a strategy to "throw everything including the kitchen sink" at frozen global credit markets, were not a guaranteed winner.

"The response to the cuts seems pretty positive, but there are a lot of possible pitfalls. It could reaffirm the negative psychology. If that's the case, investors could want to sell all risky assets," Lam said.

Bond dealers looked to the stock market for signs that the rate cuts were gaining traction, and were treated to a wild ride. The Volatility Index <.VIX>, or VIX, sometimes termed Wall Street's fear gauge, hit a record high on Wednesday and major share indices spiked up and down before ending lower.

"If (the Fed's) hope was to inject some confidence in the market, it did not seem to do the trick," said Rudy Narvas, analyst at 4CAST Ltd in New York.

Still, some analysts guess that the appetite for more rate cuts will wane before too long as credit markets slowly thaw.

"It will take time for frayed nerves to calm and for emotions to catch up to facts," said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. "The gargantuan efforts by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will eventually work." (Editing by James Dalgleish)

WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it hoped globally coordinated central bank interest rate cuts would start to stem the financial crisis that has hit markets worldwide.
   TD"We are taking appropriate action as quickly as possible during rapidly developing market changes and will continue to do so," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. "We hope that this action will start to stem the crisis."

In the first coordinated central bank move since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and central banks of Switzerland, Canada and Sweden all lowered official rates by a half-percentage point.

President George W. Bush will speak with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday about the crisis, Perino said.

Some European leaders have called for an emergency meeting of the heads of the Group of Eight major industrialized countries.

Perino said Bush was open to the idea of a meeting at the head of state level but that "right now we're all focused on the emergency issues and the actions that people can take."

She echoed Bush's comments this week that the $700 billion financial bailout would take time to have an impact.

"The government is going to do what it takes to make sure this financial system does not collapse," she said. (Reporting by Tabassum Zakaria; Editing by James Dalgleish)

   LPNEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Barclays Capital predicted the Federal Reserve will lower its target on short-term U.S. interest rate to 0.50 percent by the middle of next year to combat the global financial crisis.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks lowered interest rates by half a percentage point. This brought the Fed's target on the benchmark federal funds rate to 1.50 percent.
   TD"We do not believe the aggressive policy response ends here. The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) is likely to continue to slash interest ratse and to further expand its balance sheet," Barclays economist Michelle Meyer wrote in a research note on the rate cuts.

She said the FOMC will trim the fed funds rate by a quarter point at its Oct 28-29 meeting, followed by three more quarter-point cuts. (Reporting by Richard Leong

BRUSSELS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Europe's top business group lauded interest rate cuts around the world on Wednesday, saying they should help ease the global financial crisis by boosting investment and consumption.
   TDBut BusinessEurope, which speaks for some 20 million European companies, has cut its economic growth forecast for the 15-country euro zone this year to below the 1.3 percent expected by the European Commission due to the economic turmoil.

"We have ... reasons to applaud this (rate) decision: lowering interest rates we believe will fuel investment and consumption, help the banks to recover and restore confidence on the markets," BusinessEurope President Ernest-Antoine Seilliere told Reuters in an interview.

Central banks around the world cut interest rates in unison in a joint response to the global financial crisis.

The U.S. Federal Reserve said it was cutting its key federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1.5 percent. China, the European Central Bank (ECB) and central banks in Britain, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland also cut rates in the coordinated response, which analysts had been demanding.

"It is something that will lower the costs of distribution of credit. I cannot say it solves the credit crunch issue by itself, but it contributes to the solution," Seilliere said.

"We are really satisfied, it shows the capacity to act at the world level."

He said the banks' operation should be an example for European governments to act faster and in a more coordinated way on issues such as banking and insurance supervision, rating agencies and accounting rules.

European countries should be able "to express their common view at the world level if necessary", he said.

Seilliere said that following the recent deepening of the financial crisis, BusinessEurope had scaled down its growth forecast for the euro zone in 2008 to below the 1.3 percent projected in September by the EU's executive arm.

The group had earlier said expansion would be comfortably above that figure.

"We believe what has happened since a fortnight (ago) is too deep and too significant to maintain the figures we had in mind when we came back from the holidays," he said.

He added that the euro, which has weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar from record highs around $1.60, was still somewhat high for European businesses. The euro was trading around $1.37 on Wednesday afternoon.

"We had said 1.30 was something we could live with, 1.40 was the threshold of pain, now we are between the acceptable level and pain," he said. (Editing by Dale Hudson)

 HDUPDATE 2-Plosser says don't expect too much from Fed   BYBy Pedro Nicolaci da Costa      WC544 words   PD8 October 2008   ET13:49   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited

NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should not be seen as an omnipotent crisis fixer, and any such expectations risk undermining the central bank's effectiveness, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said on Wednesday.
   TDPlosser was speaking shortly after major central banks announced a global coordinated interest rate cut aimed at stemming a world financial crisis. He did not discuss the day's events but said monetary policy could go only so far.

"Before we seek to dramatically expand the Fed's responsibilities, I believe it is important to recognize there are limits to what central banking can do," Plosser said in his remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Plosser argued that willy-nilly interventions in the market without clearly defined boundaries are not likely to work and could lead to much greater inflation down the line.

He also said care would be needed in the debate over how much supervisory and regulatory responsibilities will ultimately lie with the Fed after the current crisis.

"Some envision the Fed's becoming the supervisor and regulator of a broad array of financial firms in order to ensure financial stability," Plosser said.

"Yet, before we seek to dramatically expand the Fed's responsibilities, I believe it is important to recognize that there are limits to what central banking can do, and this has implications for what central banking should do."

The Fed needs to think about functional regulation rather than simply regulating institutions, Plosser added while answering questions from the audience.

He said the Fed needs to mull which kind of failure in a market would put the payment system at risk and also about new financial products and the roles they play.

"I think it's clearly true that this episode that we've experienced over the past year has been ... extraordinarily challenging," Plosser said.

"Markets have a way of moving one step beyond of what you try to control to find ways around it," he added.

However, the debate over supervision is likely to be overshadowed by the dramatic action by the Fed and other central banks on Wednesday.

In an attempt to stem unprecedented global market turmoil, the Fed cut its key federal funds lending rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 percent and lowered its discount rate the same amount, to 1.75 percent three weeks before its next scheduled monetary policy meeting.

The ECB also cut by a half point to 3.75 percent as did the Bank of England, taking its rate to 4.5 percent.

China joined the effort, cutting its key rate 27 basis points. The Bank of Japan, with rates at just 0.5 percent, said it did not ease because it saw no need, but the Fed said the BOJ expressed strong support for the coordinated action.

By Daniel Trotta and Kevin Krolicki

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve stepped forward as a commercial lender of last resort and signaled a readiness to cut interest rates as stocks spun lower for a fifth straight day and pressure mounted for a coordinated, international response to the most dangerous financial shock since the Great Depression.

Financial shares tumbled, led by Bank of America Corp, a day after the largest U.S. bank said it would sell $10 billion in new stock and stoked fears that other banks may also need to raise capital.

The British government was readying a rescue package for the UK banking system likely to include public money injected into the banks. That plan will be announced on Wednesday, just five days after the U.S. government approved a $700 billion bailout fund that has failed to calm markets.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. economy was being battered by a financial crisis of "historic dimension" and that the risk for inflation has eased with the falling prices for oil and other commodities.

"In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate," said Bernanke.

In an unprecedented move, the Fed also created a new commercial paper facility that would buy short-term, highly rated debt, stepping into the corporate debt market in a program that falls outside the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the U.S. Congress on Friday.

Stocks remained under pressure while U.S. government bond prices recovered and gold prices moved higher in a continued flight to safety.

The S&P 500 index <.SPX> shed another 6 percent. That broad measure of the U.S. stock market has now dropped 15 percent over five days, its weakest run since 1987.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index fell about 4 percent early in its Wednesday session.

Earlier, Russia negotiated an emergency bailout for Iceland and unveiled an aid package for its own banks and Australia stunned markets with its steepest interest rate cut in 16 years.

Iceland, the North Atlantic island facing down a threat of "national bankruptcy," took over its second-largest bank and propped up a battered currency.

At ground zero in the crisis, the interbank lending market remained stalled, with the cost of borrowing dollars, euros and sterling all higher as financial institutions sought to preserve capital and remained unwilling to lend to each other.

ROOM FOR LOWER EUROPEAN RATES

Analysts credited the Fed with trying to create a fire break in the still-developing crisis, but said it was not enough to stop a wealth-destroying cycle in the markets.

U.S. consumer borrowing dropped for the first time in a decade in August as banks began to tighten credit standards and consumers pulled back from spending.

Fed fund futures have priced in a 50-basis-point rate cut by the Fed this month, with a 75-basis-point cut an outside possibility. Expectations have built that the weekend meeting of Group of Seven officials in Washington could set the stage for coordinated rate cuts including the European Central Bank.

"Certainly there will be room now for Europeans to have lower interest rates," International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a TV interviewer.

U.S. President George W. Bush, whose credibility with voters on economic policy has plunged, spoke with European leaders to coordinate the response to the market turmoil.

"I have been in close contact with European leaders. I was on the phone with them this morning to ensure that our actions are closely coordinated," Bush said.

The White House had earlier said Bush spoke with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

In Tokyo, Japanese government officials and media said France had proposed an emergency summit meeting of the leaders of the richest economies and Russia.

The crisis that began with defaults in the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market is also washing up on Asian shores, pushing South Korea to call for emergency talks with Tokyo and Beijing, and forcing a policy easing from India.

COUNTING THE TOLL

Shares of Bank of America Corp dropped 26 percent -- a record one-day decline -- after a surprise earnings announcement a day earlier in which the bank halved its dividend and said it would sell at least $10 billion in new stock to raise capital.

Bank of America said it had raised its $10 billion by selling 455 million shares at $22 each -- a sale price 7 percent below Tuesday's close.

Insurer MetLife Inc said after the New York close that it would issue 75 million shares to raise capital. The insurer, which has seen its stock drop almost 40 percent in recent weeks, said recent Wall Street failures had cut into its projected third-quarter investment gains.

Investors has been worried insurers will be hurt by investment losses and exposure to recent corporate calamities including the bailout of AIG and collapses of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Washington Mutual Inc, as well as real-estate related debt.

Entering the U.S. corporate earnings reporting season, other companies were expected to reinforce the view that the world's largest economy shuddered into recession at the start of the current quarter.

The largest U.S. aluminum producer, Alcoa Inc, posted a drop in quarterly earnings of more than 50 percent on crumbling demand for metal to make planes and cars, and said it would halt major investments. The result was worse than expected and underscored the growing risk of a deepening downturn.

"The sad thing here is that I don't think Alcoa is going to be alone this earnings season," said Brian Hicks, co-manager of the Global Resources Fund. "I think there will be quite a few earnings misses due to the fact that it looks like conditions have weakened much more than people expected."

   LPMove opens possibility of US interest rate cut

Ben Bernanke opened the door yesterday to possible interest rate cuts on a day that saw the US Federal Reserve announce it would buy short-term debt from US banks and corporations in an unprecedented attempt to unfreeze the money markets.
   TDThe Fed's move into the market for commercial paper - which is issued by companies and others to fund day-to-day operations - represents a dramatic expansion of its role of lender of last resort but its extraordinary action failed to calm nerves in feverish markets.

Although global stock markets regained some poise after Monday's big falls, the Fed's action had little initial effect on money markets and the S&P 500 index closed down 5.7 per cent, taking it below the psychologically important level of 1,000 for the first time in four years. The S&P financials index dropped 11.5 per cent to its lowest in 11 years.

Bank of America led the US financial sector down as its shares fell 26 per cent, knocking $38bn off its market value.

Overnight bank-borrowing costs jumped and bank shares in Europe slumped for a second day, partly on expectations that European governments would soon take individual action to recapitalise banks at the expense of shareholders.

Mr Bernanke, Fed chairman, indicated that rate cuts could be necessary to tackle the financial crisis. While stopping short of explicitly signalling that the main US interest rate would be reduced from its 2 per cent, he said the Fed would "need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate".

Earlier, the Fed said it would set up a new commercial paper funding facility to buy potentially unlimited amounts of three-month debt from banks and non-financial companies.

Senior Fed staff said the move was necessary in light of the sharp deterioration in the commercial paper market, resulting in companies struggling to raise short-term debt. Analysts welcomed the move to kick-start lending in the $1,600bn (911bn) market, which has shrunk an eighth in the past three weeks.

Policymakers have been scrambling to take additional action to shore up the US financial system amid a growing recognition that the Bush administration's $700bn bail-out plan, enacted last week, will not be sufficient given the scale and breadth of the crisis.

   LPLondon equities failed to hold gains inspired by a co-ordinated emergency interest rate cut of 50 basis points from the world's leading central banks on Wednesday, with resource stocks exerting pressure on the index amid concern about the outllook for global economic growth.

The Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank as well as the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland reduced their key lending rates in a co-ordinated move to ease the global financial crisis.
   TD"At last they all woke up," said Riccardo Barbieri-Hermitte at Bank of America.

Charles Diebel at Nomura said: "It underlines how seriously they are taking the situation and this more than anything should help instill more confidence in the system and lessen some of the tensions in the money markets".

But the FTSE 100 was unable to keep the momentum provided by the action. The benchmark index as 169 points lower at 4,435.5 before the start of US equities trade, although it stayed off session lows of 4,245 earlier in the session. The FTSE 250, seen as more representative of the domestic UK economy, was 1.5 per cent weaker at 7,322.0

Futures trading further losses for major Wall Street Indices in defiance of the measures. The S&P 500 was called 12 points lower at 993.10 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was expected to lose 130 points to 9,410, on worries about the underlying health of the financial system, even as central banks sought to improve the prognosis.

Howard Archer at Global Insight said: "The Bank of England can rightfully justify the 50 basis points interest rate cut by pointing out that underlying inflationary pressures are now starting to moderate."

"We expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates by a further 25 basis points in both November and December, taking them down to 4.00 per cent by the end of this year. Furthermore, we would not rule out deeper cuts if there is no easing in the financial sector problems"

Stephen Gifford, Grant Thornton's chief economist said: ""In many ways we are the last chance saloon. The same-day response to the financial crisis from the Bank of England and HM Treasury is certainly unprecedented and let's hope this has the desired impact. The key now is for the markets to respond to this intervention with reason and a measure of realistic optimism."

UK High street lenders were offered some hope by a government plan to part-nationalise the sector in a move to reacpitalise retail banks.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

The 50bn government scheme to recapitalise the beleaguered banking sector included seven banks and the Nationwide Building Society. It also included an additional 200bn to tackle the liquidity crisis in the financial system.

Under the plan seven banks including Abbey, now part of Santander of Spain, Barclays, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered, will apply for 25bn of preferential shares in return for a government guarantee.

In return, as well as receiving preference shares in the companies concerned, the government will be able to demand management changes, dividend cuts and the end of big bonuses. Banks will also be expected to show "full commitment to support lending to small businesses and home buyers".

In order to qualify for the programme, the Treasury said banks must raise their tier 1 capital levels- the core equity capital and disclosed reserves of an institution and the preferred measure of balance sheet strength- "by the amount and in the form the government considers appropriate".

Banking stocks, which found a measure of support in initial trade, and then fell sharply found more support as the day developed. The emergency rate cut helped provide further support.

Lloyds TSB rose 2.3 per cent to 230.8p whilst HBOS, its partner in a merger put together during the crisis was the FTSE 100's best performer, up 60 per cent at 150p

Royal Bank of Scotland, which fell almost 50 per cent in the previous two sessions, was 24 per cent higher at 112p , turning back from losses of over 10 per cent.

HSBC, which was widely seen as the UK's best capitalised bank before the Treasury;s intervention, fell 1.2 per cent to 890p. Barclays left losses of 17 per cent behind it to rise 0.5 per cent to 287p . Standard Chartered, which is also included in the scheme, lost 6.9 per cent to 12.21.

Three-month Libor interbank lending rates ticked higher, fixing at 4.52357 per cent on Wednesday, from 4.32000 per cent on Tuesday.

"The package seems at best conservative but really lacks the radicalism which the market needed to see. It has an air of damage limitation about it, " said Martin Slaney, head of derivatives at GFT.

Charles Diebel at Nomura said: "Fears over a systemic crisis refuse to fade despite the raft of measures being announced to support the financial system."

Analysts at the Bank of New York Mellon said it was too early to judge the effectiveness of the measures: "With many of the Treasury's proposed measures coming on-line over the coming week or so, it will be some time before a full assessment of the scheme's likely efficacy can be made".

Analysts at Collins Stewart were optimistic: "At least in the short-run, these moves would stabilise banks funding bases which would allow them to focus on the impending bad debt cycle and address longer-run concerns over capital levels and the deleveraging issue," said the broker in a note to clients.

Resource stocks also put intense pressure on the wider market, as their recovery during the small overall rise in the previous session faltered on worries about the outlook for global growth.

Among the miners Kazakhmys was the FTSE 100's biggest single faller, down 9 per cent at 376p. ENRC was 7.8 per cent weaker at 424p. Rio Tinto was 7.3 per cent weaker at 27.01.

Oil majors also fell. BP was 6.8 per cent weaker at 417.3p and Royal Dutch Shell lost 6.6 per cent to 14.27.

J Sainsbury, the supermarket retailer, was 8.3 per cent lower at 288.8p after its interim numbers came in toward the top end of forecasts, but it said the banking crisis had "significantly constrained" the retail sector.

On currencies markets, the dollar pared its losses against the yen, down 0.9 per cent at Y100.77.

Gold prices held above the $900 a troy ounce level while oil prices staged a recovery shortly after central banks acted.

Gold traded at $902 a troy ounce having reached a high of $915.30 before the news of rate cuts was announced. Investors have been rushing to gold as a safe haven in the face of extreme turbulance in other asset markets, buying coins and small bars and investing in gold exchange traded funds.

Oil prices pared their early losses once the news of the rate cuts hit the market on hopes that a global recession might be averted. The benchmark US crude oil prices traded 76 cents lower at $89.30 a barrel, recovering from a low of $86.05 reached before the action by central banks was announced.

Asian indices were sharply lower as fears deepened that more financial institutions would fail after the International Monetary Fund said banks may need $675bn of fresh capital.

Overnight in New York, financial stocks fell to their lowest level in 11 years and the S&P 500 fell below the 1,000-level for the first time since 2003. The benchmark index closed at 996.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 5.1 per cent lower at 9,447.11.

 HDSterling and euro lifted by joint rate cut   BYBy Esther Bintliff    WC451 words   PD8 October 2008   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPSterling and the euro reversed earlier losses on Wednesday while the Japanese yen pared its gains against the dollar, as currency markets responded to the news of co-ordinated interest rate cuts by central banks across the globe.

The British pound added 0.4 per cent against the US dollar to $1.7586, and the euro climbed 0.8 per cent to $1.3733, after the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland reduced the cost of borrowing within their economies by 50 basis points, in a dramatic move to stimulate the troubled markets.
   TDCharles Diebel at Nomura said: "The central banks of the world have finally woken up to the gravity of the current situation with co-ordinated rate cuts across the globe. This is a major step to convincing the world that they are serious about stabilising the current crisis."

He added: "This is not a panacea to cure all the worlds ills, but it certainly should help to give the markets some more breathing space."

Earlier, hopes for the 50bn government bank bail-out plan had failed to bolster equities or the UK currency, which was knocked in morning trade by steep losses on the London stock market. The pound had ticked down 0.6 per cent against the dollar to $1.7410, halting its recovery from Monday's two and a half year low of $1.7433.

Amid the growing risk aversion, the pound had also tumbled to a seven year low against the yen, down 3.1 per cent at Y172.48, while the low-yielding Japanese currency surged across the board as investors sought a safe haven. The yen leapt 11.3 per cent against the Australian dollar to Y64.55, and was up 9.2 per cent versus the Kiwi at Y58.16.

Daragh Maher at Calyon had said: "Only intervention (and there has been none so far) or co-ordinated policy action looks likely to trip up the yen at this stage."

He was proved right. Following the co-ordinated rate cut, the yen's advance against the dollar, the euro and the pound was considerably slowed.

The greenback pared its losses against the yen, down 0.9 per cent at Y100.77, having earlier sunk to an intraday low of Y98.58. The euro was down just 0.2 per cent against the yen at Y138.30, recovering from an earlier low of Y134.2, while sterling ticked down 1.1 per cent to Y176.08, having at one point plunged to Y171.94.

 HDANALYSIS-With China in fold, central banks have rich ally   BYBy Emily Kaiser and Mark Felsenthal      WC998 words   PD8 October 2008   ET22:45   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The world's humbled economic powerhouses are reaching out to developing countries to help solve the credit crisis, and China's involvement in a coordinated interest rate cut suggests they are willing to join the fight

Policy-makers in the United States and Europe seemed to be lurching from crisis to crisis, leaving investors wondering whether governments had an inkling of how to end the credit crunch. That is partly why rate cuts from seven world central banks on Wednesday failed to fully arrest a global stock selloff. [ID:nL8116323]
   TDHowever, China's participation with U.S. and European central banks in a coordinated cut for the first time shows that world leaders recognize everyone stands to lose unless something is done soon, and they are prepared to cooperate in ways that would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago.

"This is part of the process of China becoming a stakeholder (in the global economy) and a constructive one," World Bank President Robert Zoellick told reporters.

In the early stages of the financial market turmoil, which first spiked in mid-2007, it was largely viewed as an American problem that required an American solution. But calls for coordination have grown louder in recent weeks after more European countries had to step in to prop up ailing banks or guarantee deposits and the global economic outlook dimmed.

"Markets are really waiting to see whether something coherent emerges within Europe, between Europe and the U.S., and possibly for the rest of the world," Olivier Blanchard, chief economist with the International Monetary Fund, told Reuters.

It may take some time to sink in, particularly among investors who are far more focused on the immediate problem of getting credit markets functioning normally, but coherent action seems to be taking shape.

Alex Patelis, head of international economics at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that not only did China join Wednesday's rate-cutting party, but another recently rich emerging economy -- Russia -- was in talks to aid Iceland with a 4 billion euro loan.

"Political and economic historians take note. We are witnessing the result of years of global imbalances. The world's savings now reside with emerging markets. How these countries decide to channel their reserves will be critical," he wrote in a note to clients.

WILL IT WORK?

In a sign that even mighty Washington now recognizes it needs help from all corners, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called for a special meeting of the Group of 20, which includes China and Russia, after finance officials from the Group of Seven -- the United States, Canada, Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Japan -- gather on Friday.

In addition, David McCormick, the U.S. Treasury's top international hand, said G7 officials would hold a dinner with Russia after their meeting Friday afternoon.

While political conflicts mean Russia is not a likely candidate to help the U.S. economy, China is another story.

"It's clear that they (China) have the means to make a difference. And it may be that they will," the IMF's Blanchard said.

China has a clear incentive to help. The United States and Europe are two of its best export customers, and China can ill afford to see them fall into such a deep recession that they stop buying. China is also the world's second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury notes, with $518.7 billion as of July.

So will coordinated rate cuts solve the credit crisis?

There is no quick fix because banks need to pare debt and rebuild their balance sheets, and that is a slow process.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has been on a rate-cutting campaign for more than a year, but it has had limited effect on the economy because debt-laden banks are reluctant to part with cash even when rates are low.

That is one reason why world stock markets were less than enthusiastic about Wednesday's moves.

By coordinating rate cuts, policy-makers hope to convince investors that they not only fully grasped the severity of the situation but were willing to use the heaviest weapon in their arsenal to ease the crisis.

"WE'RE IN A MESS"

The joint effort also spared the U.S. economy from a hit to the dollar from a go-it-alone easing that would have hurt exports -- one of few U.S. bright spots -- and added to the weight of already elevated energy costs.

Central banks have already teamed up across borders to channel liquidity to financial centers in Europe, North America and Asia with currency swap lines linking the Fed and other central banks that are worth up to a total of $620 billion.

Still, credit strains persist despite that effort and other ramped-up central bank lending programs.

"It shows that all of the central bankers of the civilized world understand that we're in a mess and need to get their act together both by coordinating their rate movements and by coordinating their liquidity movements," said former Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President William Ford.

Interest rate cuts take time to work, so Wednesday's action offers no quick fix. In six months to a year, the lower borrowing costs should filter through to the broader economy.

"We're still feeling the shock waves of the panic, but once everybody calms down, we're going to see lower world interest rates, which is going to stimulate the economy, particularly in the U.S.," said Mark Gertler, an economics professor at New York Univerity who has co-authored numerous academic papers with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.

 Cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and People's Bank of China, among others, were designed to inject confidence into markets reeling from the worst financial crisis in nearly 80 years.

 MSCI's benchmark world index was down 2 percent compared with losses of 2.9 percent when the cuts were announced.

-- Adds Quotes, Background From 15th Paragraph

     TOKYO (MNI) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on 
Tuesday that none of the seven members on the BOJ's policy board called 
for lowering interest rates at the regular two-day policy-setting 
meeting that ended this afternoon. 

     But he declined comment on details of the board's discussion, 
including whether the need for a credit easing was mentioned at all 
during the discussion. 

     Nevertheless, he admitted that downside growth risks to Japan's 
economy had increased and that the expected economic recovery had been 
delayed for an undetermined period. 

     "We discussed how monetary policy should be on the basis of the 
outlook for the economy presented by each board member. But there was no 
proposal to lower interest rates at today's meeting," Shirakawa told a 
news conference after the board voted unanimously to keep the target for 
overnight lending rates among commercial banks at 0.5%. 

     Shirakawa also downplayed growing market speculation about a 
possible concerted monetary policy action, rejecting the concept of all 
major central banks moving in the same direction at the same time. This 
would be "undesirable," he said.  
                                                               
     Instead, he argued that central banks, including the BOJ, will make  
monetary policy decisions on the basis of their respective assessments 
of their own growth and inflation perspectives. 

     The governor acknowledged that the downside risks to Japan's economy 
had increased due to slowing global growth and intensifying turmoil in 
the international financial markets. 

     "The timing of Japan's economic recovery has been pushed back 
further than previously expected," he said, but quickly added that the 
outlook is too uncertain to allow a more precise forecast at this time. 
                        
     "We will convey an impression of how much the recovery will be 
delayed in the (semi-annual) Outlook Report," he said. 

     The BOJ will release the report on Oct. 31, when the board next 
meets to set policy. The report will present the central bank's latest 
forecasts for Gross Domestic Product and consumer prices for the next 
three fiscal years to March 31, 2011. 

     Shirakawa did note in particular that "tensions in global markets 
have been heightened and downside risks to the global economy are also 
growing." 

     "Currently there is no pressure to adjust production capacity or 
labor (in Japan), but downside risks to Japan's economic growth are 
growing," he added. 
                                  
     The BOJ's Statement on Monetary Policy released earlier in the day 
said that, "in the longer run, the economy is likely to return to a 
sustainable growth path with price stability." 

     The addition of the words "in the longer run" to their long-held 
view indicated that the timing of an economic recovery was being pushed 
back by the global credit crisis. 
                                         
     In response to a question, Shirakawa said "it is technically 
possible" for the BOJ cut the Basic Loan rate, equivalent to the Lombard 
loan rate, by itself without changing the unsecured overnight call loan 
rate, which is he BOJ's key policy interest rate. 
   
     The Basic Loan rate stands at 0.75%, 0.25 percentage point above 
the target for overnight rates. Both are far below key policy rates of 
the European Central Bank at 4.25% and the U.S. Federal Reserve at 2%. 

     Some market participants are speculating that the BOJ, the ECB and 
the Fed will engage in a concerted rate cut soon after the G-7 meeting 
on Friday. 

     European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said last 
Thursday that the Governing Council discussed the option of an interest 
rate cut but decided "unanimously" to leave key rates unchanged.  
Analysts interpreted the rest of his remarks as leaving open the door to 
a rate cut in the near future. 
     
     Meanwhile, sharp US job losses in September indicate that the U.S. 
economy has remained weak and could worsen further, prompting 
speculation that the Fed will cut rate at its next meeting in late 
October, if not before. 

     Market players will be focused on a statement to be issued by the 
Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors after their 
meeting in Washington on Friday. 

     Shirakawa said at today's press conference that the G-7 policy 
framework is working and that major central banks have already arranged 
coordinated dollar-fund injections into global money markets to help 
boost confidence. 

     "Considering the time lag (with which) monetary policy actions 
(take full effect), each country assesses its own economic reality," he 
said. "We will keep in close contact with other countries and will take 
appropriate policy action based on our own economic conditions."   

     "We are at the stage where we must closely monitor downside 
risks," he said.    

     Shirakawa attributed the recent drop in Tokyo stock prices to the 
global market slump. 

     "Concerns about a further failure of financial institutions and 
weaker economic growth in emerging countries following the economic 
slowdown in industrialized nations are behind recent weak share prices 
worldwide," he said. 

     He said the BOJ is always closely watching stock prices and 
their impact on the economy and financial system. 

     The Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell below the key 10,000 level early 
Tuesday for the first time since December 20003, though it later 
rebounded slightly. 

     The benchmark index closed down 317.19 points, or 3%, at 10,155.90 
after hitting a low of 9,916.21 in morning trade in reaction to the 
plunge in the U.S. stock prices overnight. 

     The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was off 800 points at its 
intraday low, ended down 369.88 points, or 3.6%, at 9,955.50 on Monday, 
falling below 10,000 for the first time since October 2004. The DJIA has 
fallen 12.8% since mid-September when Lehman Brothers filed for 
bankruptcy protection. 

     Shirakawa said the BOJ will help improve conditions for households 
so that they can make the best possible decisions about what assets to 
hold. However, the central bank will not give specific direction to 
households in their investments, such as whether they should invest more 
in assets that offer higher returns but have higher risks. 

     "For households, the biggest purchases are homes. They get loans to 
buy a house, which means they are already taking a big risk," he said. 
"Regarding future incomes, working for companies that offer life-time 
employment means risks for individuals are overlapping with the (risks 
experienced by the) companies they work for."

      "It's not so easy to judge whether households are shying away from 
taking risks," he added.

     Shirakawa's predecessor, Toshihiko Fukui, has said in the past that 
households must take some more calculated investment risks to build up 
their assets during a time of uncertainty.

 HDBernanke: US may be facing prolonged period of economic pain   BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC726 words   PD7 October 2008   ET20:01   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Tuesday that the financial crisis has not only darkened the United States' current economic performance but also could prolong the pain.

The Fed chief's more gloomy assessment appeared to open the door wider to an interest rate cut on or before Oct. 28-29, the central bank's next meeting, to brace the wobbly economy.
   TDBernanke said the Fed will "need to consider" whether its current stance of holding rates steady "remains appropriate" given the fallout from the worst financial crisis in decades.

If the Fed does lower its key rate from 2 percent it would mark an about-face. The Fed in June had halted an aggressive rate-cutting campaign to revive the economy out of fear those low rates would aggravate inflation. Since then, financial and economic conditions have deteriorated, while record-high energy prices have calmed, giving the Fed more leeway to again cut rates.

Many believe the U.S. is on the brink of, or already in, its first recession since 2001.

"The outlook for economic growth has worsened," Bernanke said told the annual meeting here of the National Association for Business Economics.

All told, economic activity is likely to be "subdued" during the remainder of this year and into next year, Bernanke said. "The heightened financial turmoil that we have experienced of late may well lengthen the period of weak economic performance and further increase the risks to growth," he warned.

Consumers -- major shapers of economic activity -- have buckled under the weight of rising joblessness, shrinking paychecks, hard-to-get credit, declining net wealth and tanking home and stock values. All the strains are "now showing through more clearly to consumer spending," Bernanke said.

Inflation numbers are "very ugly right now," Bernanke acknowledged. Even so, he believed slowing growth in the United States and overseas will continue to damp prices for energy, food and other commodities, meaning a better inflation outlook ahead. Inflation will moderate "pretty significantly" over the next few quarters, he predicted.

Meanwhile, worsening sales prospects and a heightened sense of uncertainty have begun to weigh more heavily on businesses, making them more cautious to hire and to invest in their companies, he said.

Employers cut jobs in September at the fastest pace in more than five years, the government reported last week. Payrolls were slashed by 159,000 last month alone. It was the ninth straight month of job losses. A staggering 760,000 jobs have disappeared so far this year.

The financial and credit crises, which took a turn for the worst in September and continue to stubbornly persist, are likely to "increase the restraint on economic activity in the period ahead," Bernanke said.

Even households with good credit histories are now facing difficulties obtaining mortgages or home equity lines of credit, he noted. Banks are also reducing credit card limits and denial rates on auto loan applications are rising, he said.

Banks, too, are feeling the strain of a lockup in lending, particularly in the market for commercial paper.

To that end, the Fed on Tuesday announced a radical plan to buy massive amounts of this short-term debt in an effort to break through a credit clog that is imperiling the economy.

"The expansion of Federal Reserve lending is helping financial firms cope with reduced access to their usual sources of funding," Bernanke explained.

Invoking Depression-era emergency powers, the Fed will begin buying commercial paper -- short-term funding that many companies rely on to pay their workers and buy supplies.

Bernanke believed the Fed's bold actions -- along with the $700 billion financial bailout signed into law by President Bush on Friday -- will help restore confidence in financial markets and help them function more normally.

"These are momentous steps, but they are being taken to address a problem of historic dimensions," he said.

He also defended the timing of the actions by the Fed and the Bush administration. "We have learned from historical experience with severe financial crises that if government intervention comes only at a point at which many or most financial institutions are insolvent or nearly so, the costs of restoring the system are greatly increased. This is not the situation we face today," he said.

Fed to buy massive amounts of short-term debt
   TDWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve moved swiftly to break through a credit clog that is imperiling the economy, saying Tuesday it would buy massive amounts of short-term debt and hinting that it may cut interest rates. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that the financial crisis has not only darkened the country's current economic performance but also could prolong the pain.

Stocks tumble as Street worries about financials

NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street extended its steep declines Tuesday as enthusiasm over the Federal Reserve's latest efforts to inject frozen credit markets with a dose of much-needed confidence gave way to concerns about financial companies' balance sheets. Trading remained fractious, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing more than 225 points. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned in a speech on the economy Tuesday that the financial crisis could extend the difficulty the economy is facing. Some traders appeared to regard his remarks as a sign that an interest rate cut could be in the offing, but that did not stanch the losses that built on Monday's huge drop.

Bernanke: More economic pain ahead

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Tuesday that the financial crisis has not only darkened the country's current economic performance but also could prolong the pain. The Fed chief's more gloomy assessment appeared to open the door wider to an interest rate cut on or before Oct. 28-29, the central bank's next meeting, to brace the wobbly economy.

Fed minutes show policymakers saw balanced risks

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even in the midst of a severe meltdown on Wall Street, Federal Reserve officials at their September meeting believed the risks from weaker growth and higher inflation were roughly equal. The Fed officials discussed the financial turmoil during their closed-door meeting on Sept. 16, according to minutes released Tuesday. The meeting occurred a day investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed -- the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. It was also hours before the Fed announced it was extending an $85 billion loan to rescue American International Group, the world's largest insurance company.

Retirement accounts have lost $2 trillion

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' retirement plans have lost as much as $2 trillion in the past 15 months, Congress' top budget analyst estimated Tuesday. The upheaval that has engulfed the financial industry and sent the stock market plummeting is devastating workers' savings, forcing people to hold off on major purchases and consider delaying their retirement, said Peter Orszag, the head of the Congressional Budget Office.

Oil prices rebound after falling to 8-month low

NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil prices rebounded slightly Tuesday, briefly rising back above $90 a barrel after some stability returned to the shaky financial system and prodded investors to put money back into the market. It was crude's first positive session in five days. Some recovery was to be expected a day after prices skidded to an eight-month low on fears that a spreading financial crisis will undercut demand for crude. However, trading was volatile as investors remained uneasy, and analysts said oil would likely continue its downward trend given the ongoing stresses battering the global economy.

Insurance giant AIG's role in market crisis probed

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former top executives of insurance giant American International Group Inc. were on the receiving end of a verbal smackdown Tuesday as a congressional panel probed the chain of events that forced the government to bail out the conglomerate. Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, who ran AIG for 38 years until 2005, again blamed the company's financial woes on his successors, former CEOs Martin Sullivan and Robert Willumstad. They, in turn, cast much of the blame on accounting rules that forced AIG to take tens of billions of dollars in losses stemming from exposure to toxic mortgage-related securities.

Credit markets ease a bit on Fed move to buy paper

NEW YORK (AP) -- The credit markets saw some slight easing Tuesday after the Federal Reserve said it would buy commercial paper, the unsecured short-term debt that companies sell for their short-term cash needs. In the eyes of many market participants, the move to grease the commercial paper market could do more to get people lending again than the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress.

Eli Lilly settles Zyprexa inquiries in 32 states

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co. cleared another legal cloud hanging over its top-selling drug Zyprexa when it announced a $62 million settlement Tuesday, but several other storms are still brewing for the antipsychotic medication. Lilly agreed to pay 32 states and Washington, D.C., to resolve an investigation into the company's marketing practices.

AMD to spin off factories in bid to save money

NEW YORK (AP) -- In a move to dramatically cut costs and better compete with Intel Corp., chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said Tuesday it will spin off its factories into a new joint venture with investors in the Persian Gulf state of Abu Dhabi. The deal should shore up AMD's finances and let it focus on the design and development of computer chips. The new venture, to be based in the U.S. and called Foundry Co., will absorb AMD's manufacturing plants, including two in Dresden, Germany.

   LPTHE EVENT: The U.S. Federal Reserve Tuesday created a new program to backstop issuers of commercial paper, something the Treasury Department finds necessary to prevent "substantial disruptions" to the economy.

The stock market, battered in recent sessions, took little solace and is down again. Treasurys also were mostly lower, while crude oil futures rose.
   TDTHE BACKGROUND: Amid the ongoing credit crisis, money-market mutual funds and other investors have become increasingly reluctant to purchase commercial paper, a crucial source of short-term funding to keep the gears of the financial system turning. The Fed unveiled the "Commercial Paper Funding Facility" to allow for direct purchases of three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper from eligible issuers.

HOW IT WOULD WORK: The Fed will provide financing for the facility through a special unit or "special purpose vehicle." The Treasury will make a special deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in support of the program.

MARKET REACTION: U.S. stocks are having another rough day. The DJIA was down 235 at late afternoon trading.

The euro gained against the dollar, and the dollar gained against the yen.

Treasury prices are mostly lower.

Crude oil futures rose about $2.50 a barrel

INITIAL SIGNS OF RELIEF: Short-term markets saw some tentative signs of improvement early Tuesday after the Federal Reserve unveiled a new effort to help loosen tight lending conditions in those struggling markets. Short-term Treasury bills, a safe-haven for money-market investors, lost ground and swap spreads pulled in.

FED CHIEF SPEAKS: Faced with an economic and financial market crisis, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday sent a strong signal that officials may lower interest rates against a backdrop of waning price pressures.

Bernanke also said he believes the private sector should address market difficulties when possible, "in those cases when financial stability is threatened...intervention to protect the public interest may well be justified." "So long as financial conditions warrant, we will continue to look for ways to reduce funding pressures in key markets," he said.

BERNANKE'S INFLATION OUTLOOK: Bernanke also said that while U.S. inflation has been "ugly" over the past year, it should moderate "pretty significantly" in coming months. Still, he said it is too soon to declare victory given the volatility in commodity prices.

WHAT'S BEING SAID: "The move is extraordinary, as evidenced by the fact that the Fed resorted to the creation of a special purpose vehicle, which the Fed must have decided was necessary because the purchase of unsecured commercial paper is not something that Fed has the legal authority to engage in," said Miller Tabak & Co. chief bond market strategist Tony Crescenzi in a research note.

"I see it helping munis in that it will boost liquidity and maybe dealers will start to buy again," said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading and research at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. "The problems with (variable rate demand notes) stem from the liquidity providers. To the extent this helps the financial crisis it will eventually work in to the VRDN market."

"The Fed (is trying to) make sure good credit (companies) still have access to credit," said Ira Jersey, an interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse. "If they don't then the system freezes."

"It's going to be a positive for this market, but we haven't seen much reaction yet," said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed-income trading at Morgan Keegan. "Investors first want to understand what the backstop means," he said.

The Fed's support of the CP market will "help to ease the fears of those staying away from money-market funds," said Connie Bugbee, managing director of iMoneyNet. "Anything that helps the comfort level in the market could help bring rates down."

 HDFED FOCUS-Grim Bernanke makes rate cut seem inevitable   BYBy Ros Krasny      WC692 words   PD8 October 2008   ET00:46   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPCHICAGO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - A sobering economic assessment from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday was widely seen as laying the groundwork for a deep cut in U.S. interest rates, possibly before the Fed's end-of-month meeting.

Given a mix of recent weak economic data and a worsening outlook for growth, the Fed "will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate," Bernanke told the National Association for Business Economics.
   TDThe comments electrified short-term interest rate futures markets, where dealers piled on new bets that the Fed will cut its benchmark lending rate to 1.25 percent this month from the current 2 percent.

"The Fed chairman just gave the green light for a rate cut at the October meeting if not before," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.

Shortly later, minutes from the mid-September Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed that a faction of Fed policy-makers had been almost -- but not quite -- ready to push for a rate cut then, before financial markets lurched lower again.

Rate futures now show a 44 percent chance for a three-quarters of a percentage point rate cut this month, and talk continued that the Fed, either alone or with other central banks, might move before its Oct. 28-29 scheduled policy-setting meeting.

Futures earlier on Tuesday had initially erased prospects for a 75 basis point rate cut this month after the Fed announced plans to buy commercial paper, the short-term debt that many companies use to fund their day-to-day operations.

"The cut could occur as a coordinated move with the European Central Bank and other central banks," said Asha Bangalore, economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.

A SERIES OF UNPRECEDENTED EVENTS

Like Bernanke, the minutes of the Fed's Sept. 16 meeting offered a cautionary message on how the credit market strains that have led to an unprecedented government effort to bail out the financial sector were bleeding into the broader economy.

"Some members emphasized that if intensifying financial strains led to a significant worsening of the growth outlook, a policy response could be required," the minutes said.

With three weeks to go before the two-day FOMC gathering, U.S. stock markets have been in freefall.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> has racked up its biggest five-day point loss on record and the biggest percentage decline since 1987, down a whopping 14.6 percent over the five trading days ended on Tuesday.

Speaking in Texas on Monday, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans declined to say what, specifically, might force the FOMC to lower rates below the current 2 percent level.

But Evans indicated he would be cutting his growth forecast for next year, and that official Fed forecasts would go the same way. "It's difficult to see that the first-half 2009 outlook will be better than we thought," he said.

Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern did not address the rate outlook in a speech in Chicago on Tuesday, but the policy hawk conceded the inflation outlook has improved on the back of rising joblessness.

Stern, the central bank's longest-serving regional bank head, termed the current financial crisis "unprecedented ... in my long career at the Fed."

Certainly, some policy-makers are likely to argue against the need for a change to the federal funds rate.

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said a rate cut was not "the right tool" for now because of the market's extreme volatility.

Dealers suspect the Bernanke faction will win the day.

"We now see a 50 basis point intermeeting cut as very likely, followed by an additional 25 basis point at the October 28-29 FOMC meeting," said Michael Hanson, economist at Barclays Capital. (For more stories on Fed policy, please click on [FED/AHEAD]) (Editing by Leslie Adler)

 HDWRAPUP 1-Fed opens door to rate cuts, commercial paper buys   BYBy Mark Felsenthal      WC975 words   PD7 October 2008   ET15:02   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday signaled a readiness to lower U.S. interest rates in a dramatic policy shift as he warned of a worsening economic outlook and the "historic dimensions" of the global financial crisis.

The central bank also said it would begin buying commercial paper, a form of short-term debt vital to many businesses, to try to restore credit flows.
   TDMinutes of the Fed's last rate-setting meeting released on Tuesday showed that as recently as mid-September, while some policy-makers thought interest rate cuts might be necessary, the central bank generally saw holding rates steady as consistent with the view that economic growth would gradually begin to strengthen in 2009.

However, Bernanke told the National Association for Business Economics that recent economic data and financial developments show the outlook for growth has worsened. The outlook for inflation, while still uncertain, has improved somewhat as oil and other commodity prices have eased, he said.

"In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate," Bernanke said.

The Fed took aggressive action on another front on Tuesday, saying it would begin buying the short-term debt many companies use to fund their day-to-day operations, its latest emergency move to try to restore credit flows and protect the economy.

The central bank is creating a facility to buy commercial paper because investors such as money market mutual funds have increasingly shied away from this form of corporate debt, a damaging economic development.

"The volume of outstanding commercial paper has shrunk, interest rates on longer term commercial paper have increased significantly, and an increasingly high percentage of outstanding paper must now be refinanced each day," the Fed said in announcing the program with the blessing of the U.S. Treasury.

"PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS"

In opening the door to rate cuts, Bernanke is departing from the view he and other Fed officials had expressed until recently that lower rates would likely have little effect in boosting economic activity while credit markets are frozen.

The actions failed to halt the downward slide of U.S. stocks, which fell by more than 5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost more than 1,400 points over the past five sessions, nearly 13 percent of its value and the biggest cumulative point loss on record for the blue-chip index.

The Fed slashed interbank lending rates to 2 percent in seven steps between mid-September of 2007 and the end of April in a bid to put a floor under economic activity. Since then, the central bank has focused on cash auctions and loans of ultra-safe Treasury securities to unlock credit markets.

The Fed has taken a number of increasingly aggressive emergency steps to channel money into financial markets to restore credit. Measures include ever-more-generous auctions, currency swap lines with foreign central banks, and liberal availability of the central bank's discount window emergency lending facility beyond the traditional clientele of deposit-taking banks.

"Bernanke's speech sent a strong message that the Fed is pulling out all stops in its policy response," said Michael Hanson of Barclays Capital Global Economics in New York.

Alongside the Fed's liquidity efforts, the Treasury Department will begin to buy up to $700 billion in tainted mortgage-related and other credit assets.

"These are momentous steps, but they are being taken to address a problem of historic dimensions," Bernanke said.

BERNANKE SEES SUBDUED GROWTH

He said the economy is poised for subdued growth during the remainder of this year and into 2009. Financial turmoil is likely to extend the weak period and increase risks to growth, he said.

"Continued efforts to stabilize the financial markets are essential," Bernanke said. "The Federal Reserve will continue to use the tools at its disposal to improve market functioning and liquidity."

The Fed chair took a softer tone on price increases, which have bedeviled the inflation-wary central bank even amid a deep housing slump and mortgage-related losses that have put financial markets into disarray.

While inflation has been elevated, prices for oil and other commodities prices have tumbled from recent peaks and import prices have fallen, Bernanke said.

Further, expectations of future inflation had eased, he said, which would lessen any chance of a wage-price spiral from igniting.

"These recent developments, together with economic activity that is likely to fall short of potential for a time, should lead to rates of inflation more consistent with price stability," Bernanke said.

In establishing a special entity to buy commercial paper, the Fed is making an unusual move into buying debt that is not collateralized to help thaw frozen credit markets.

The Fed coordinated the action with the Treasury Department, which will make a deposit of funds at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, with Fed officials saying the size of the deposit would be substantial.

Officials said the program, called the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, will buy only top-rated commercial paper, would be up and running soon, though probably not in a matter of days. Its size will depend on details yet to be worked out with financial market participants, Fed staff told reporters.

Of $1.75 trillion in commercial paper outstanding in August, eligible issuers accounted for $1.3 trillion. But the central bank does not intend to buy anywhere near that amount, the officials said. (With additional reporting by Glenn Somerville and David Lawder; Editing by Leslie Adler)

   LPCHICAGO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. short-term interest rate futures fell on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced a new commercial paper funding facility, which dealers anticipated might lessen the need for big cuts to benchmark lending rates.

The sell-off erased implied prospects for a possible 75 basis point Fed rate cut this month, and pushed the chances for a 50 basis point cut as low as 86 percent.
   TDLate on Monday, futures had shown a 40-percent chance that the Fed would slash rates to 1.25 percent from 2 percent at or before its Oct. 28-29 policy meeting. (Reporting by Ros Krasny; Editing by Tom Hals)

 HDWRAPUP 1-Fed hawk wary of rate cut but another softens tone   BYBy Alister Bull      WC667 words   PD7 October 2008   ET03:19   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP ST. LOUIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - One top U.S. Federal Reserve official on Monday warned against another interest rate cut to offset the credit crisis, but a second policy-maker who has defied cuts all year said inflation was receding as a concern.
   TD "I'm not as worried as I was before that we might, when the financial system was repaired, have ... inflationary pressure," Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher told a community bankers in Wichita Falls, Texas.

 Fisher had dissented against monetary policy easing all year, although he voted with the rest of the U.S. central bank's interest rate-setting committee to keep rates on hold at 2 percent at their last meeting, on Sept. 16.

 Stock markets slid on Monday as investors digested the prospect of the credit crunch inflicting a lasting U.S. recession that curbs growth worldwide, despite a $700 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout agreed by Congress on Friday.

 Financial futures markets currently imply the Fed will impose an emergency 50 basis point inter-meeting cut before the next scheduled gathering, Oct. 28-29.

 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke may confirm or deny these suspicions in a speech that he is scheduled to give in Washington on Tuesday.

 But St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard warned that another cut may do more harm than goods.

 "I don't think lowering rates is the right tool for this environment," he told Reuters in an interview, reiterating a warning against further policy easing that he made last week.

 "My experience is, you're in the middle of this much volatility, this much turmoil. You lower rates. I don't think it has very much effect," he said.

 "When you're trying to solve one problem, you don't want to create a new problem and compound the situation. I think that that is what happened in the 1970s," he said, referring to period of soaring U.S. inflation that was costly to reverse.

 Bullard is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year.

 The Fed has already slashed rates by 3.25 percentage points since September 2007 to shield the economy from the worst U.S. housing crisis since the Great Depression.

 It halted the easing campaign at 2 percent and made plain that it wanted to concentrate on massive injections of liquidity into credit markets to keep the system functioning.

 If it now decides to cut rates again, it would probably justify the action by pointing out the additional damage done to the outlook for economic growth by renewed market strain.

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans did not discuss policy, but he did say that the stress would take a bite out of growth.

 "Given the financial stress we're looking at, it's difficult to see that the first-half 2009 outlook will be better than we thought," Evans told reporters after a speech to the Association for Manufacturing Technology meeting in Lost Pines, Texas. "I'll be marking down my forecast for 2009."

 Evans is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, but will be in 2009.

 Bullard also said that recent developments in financial markets had added to downside risks for the economy -- although he did not feel this warranted monetary policy action.

 "The second half of the year will be slow, very slow, but it will be positive, and then hopefully things are better in 2009," he said in the Reuters interview.

 "The overwhelming thing about the current outlook is the turmoil of the last couple of weeks and what the fallout from that will be, and that is very hard to put into a forecast," he said.

 HDMORTGAGES/AGENCIES - Sectors firm as Bernanke signals cut   BYBy Julie Haviv      WC689 words   PD7 October 2008   ET22:15   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Yield spreads on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac U.S. mortgage-backed securities and most agency debt tightened against Treasuries on Tuesday in choppy trade amid concerns that the rapidly spreading credit crisis would drag the economy into a recession.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled a readiness to lower U.S. interest rates in a dramatic shift to support an economy battered by a financial crisis of "historic dimension."
   TDRecent economic data and financial developments show that the outlook for growth has worsened and downside risks to growth have gained, Bernanke said in remarks to the National Association for Business Economics. The outlook for inflation, while still uncertain, has improved somewhat as oil and other commodity prices have eased, he said. For details, double-click on [nN07466449]

In the agency debt market, many participants are opting to stay sidelined.

"The real story is that there is a buyer's strike right now as nobody wants to take on any paper due to balance sheet constraints," said Rajiv Setia, fixed income strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.

"Maybe we will eventually hit a crossroads, but headline risk remains and few people want to take on risk," he said.

Fannie Mae 5.375 percent 10-year benchmark notes due June 12, 2017 were 1.3 basis points tighter at 92.2 basis points bid and 87.2 basis points offered over Treasuries, according to Goldman Sachs data.

Freddie Mac 3.125 percent 2-year reference notes due October, 25, 2010 were 2.5 basis points tighter at 106.2 basis points bid and 104 basis points offered, the data showed.

"People are worried about what foreign investors might do and so they are hoarding assets because things may get worse," he said.

Two themes continue to play out in the agency debt market: the spread curve continues to steepen, and Federal Home Loan Bank debt has "massively" underperformed other names as risk aversion reached extremes, Setia and his team said in recent research.

While it is hard to quantify exactly when or at what level FHLB yield spreads will turn around, the current spread differential of 20 to 35 basis points relative to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency debt securities is wide enough to warrant serious investor focus, the team said.

Investors should start scaling into FHLB debt overweights relative to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac across the yield curve, but particularly in 5-year and lower tenors, they said.

Mortgage bonds outperformed Treasuries on Tuesday.

The yield spread on Fannie Mae MBS paying 5.50 percent interest ended at about 1.5 basis points tighter versus swaps and 4 basis points tighter versus Treasuries, according to Arthur Frank, director and head of MBS research at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.

Early in the session the Federal Reserve announced a new Commercial Paper Funding Facility to complement existing credit facilities. The move by the Fed to unclog the commercial paper market, which companies use to fund their day-to-day operations, caused a sharp sell-off in Treasuries, but losses were eventually pared.

Many market participants, however, are disappointed that central banks have not orchestrated a coordinated interest-rate cut to calm financial markets.

Active 15- and 30-year mortgage securities were unchanged to 5/32 lower. Bond equivalent yields on 30-year 5.50 percent coupon MBS ranged from 5.309 percent to 5.406 percent.

Prices on 30-year 6.00 percent coupons were 1/32 to 2/32 lower. Bond equivalent yields ranged from 5.515 percent to 5.559 percent.

U.S. Treasuries prices cut back or erased their losses as sharpening stock market losses fed an active bid for safe-haven government debt.

U.S. 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> were 7/32 lower at 104-7/32 to yield 3.488 percent. Yields, which move inversely to price, were nearly unchanged from Monday's 3.492 percent. (Editing by Dan Grebler)
