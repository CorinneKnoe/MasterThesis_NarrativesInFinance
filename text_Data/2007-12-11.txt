   LPThe Federal Reserve is set to overhaul the way it provides liquidity support to financial markets, following a negative reaction to Tuesday's interest rate cut. 

US stocks fell sharply after the central bank cut rates by only 25 basis points to 4.25 per cent and failed to offer a clear signal of more to come. 
   TDThe overhaul, which could be announced as early as Wednesday, is likely to take the shape of a new liquidity facility that will auction loans to banks. This would allow the Fed to provide liquidity directly to a large number of financial institutions against a wide range of collateral without the stigma of its existing discount window loans. 

The idea is that this would ease severe strains in the market for interbank loans, and help restore more normal conditions in credit markets generally. 

However, it is unclear whether the new initiative will win over investors disappointed by Tuesday's announcement. Many had hoped for a 50bp cut in the main interest rate, or at least a 50bp reduction in the discount rate, and a stronger indication of further cuts in the pipeline. 

Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse, said: "The Fed disappointed the market in lots of ways." 

The S&P 500 closed down 2.5 per cent at 1,477.65, after being up 0.4 per cent before the decision was released. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was at 2.92 per cent, down from 3.14 per cent. 

The Fed said the deterioration in financial market conditions had "increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation". 

But while it dropped its assessment that the risks to growth and inflation are "roughly balanced", the Fed did not say that it now thinks the risks to growth outweigh the risks to inflation. 

It offered no assessment of the balance of risks, saying it would act "as needed" to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth. This formula in effect means the Fed is keeping its options open. 

Investors could infer a willingness to consider future rate cuts, but the signal was weaker than many had expected. This reflects the fact that the Fed remains more concerned about the risks to inflation than most investors. 

The Fed said "incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing" reflecting an "intensification of the housing correction" and "some softening in business and consumer spending." It acknowledged that "strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks". 

However, the US central bank made almost no changes at all to its language on inflation, reiterating that "energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation". 

Eric Rosengren, a committee member and president of the Boston Fed, dissented in favour of a 50bp cut. At the last meeting, Tom Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, dissented in favour of no cut. 

Money market traders had earlier priced in a decline in Libor when it sets on Wednesday. Later, those expectations reversed and one-month Libor is seen at 5.21 per cent on Wednesday, up from an estimate of 4.96 per cent and above Tuesday's setting of 5.20 per cent.

 HDWhy Borrowers May Not Benefit From Rate Cut --- Many Loans Are Now Tied To Benchmark That Remains High Despite Fed's Moves   BYBy Jane J. Kim    WC1,235 words   PD12 December 2007   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGD1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPNot all borrowers are benefiting from the Fed's moves to cut interest rates. The problem: Loans that are tied to a variety of interest-rate benchmarks -- some of which aren't necessarily moving in lockstep with Fed action.

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% -- the central bank's third rate cut since mid-September -- to help ease the credit crunch and reduce the economy's chances of falling into a recession. The moves have helped some borrowers who have seen interest rates on their credit cards and home-equity lines of credit fall. Interest rates on many fixed-rate mortgages also have dropped amid a decline in Treasury yields as investors sought out safe investments.
   TDBut rates remain stubbornly high on other loans, including student debt and many adjustable-rate loans made to the same type of subprime borrowers whose troubles are now reverberating throughout the global financial system. These rates remain high because many of these loans are tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and not to more conventional interest-rate benchmarks such as Treasurys or banks' prime rate.

Libor, which is an interest rate banks charge on loans to each other, normally tracks the federal-funds rate closely. But continuing worries over the credit crisis have kept Libor unusually high -- partly because banks are reluctant to lend to one another -- even as other short-term interest rates have fallen in recent months. The U.S. dollar three-month Libor yesterday was 5.11%, down from 5.36% in late June. Over the same period, three-month Treasury bill yields have fallen much more steeply, to 2.95% from 4.8%. "The Libor spread is screaming that there is a big, big stress point in the banking system," says James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, a market-research firm in Chicago.

Borrowers may need to read the fine print of their loan agreement or contact their lender to know what benchmark their loan is tied to. The biggest impact is likely to be felt among borrowers with ARMs that are about to reset. "If you have a Libor-indexed ARM and you're facing a reset, that's going to be very disadvantageous because of the divergence between the Libor and Treasury yields," says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

For example, consumers with an ARM whose annual reset rate is linked to one-year Libor are likely to see their interest rate jump to 6.75% or more. By contrast, a similar loan that's linked to one-year Treasurys is likely to reset to a rate that's about 5.75%, he says.

Libor is frequently used to set rates for ARMs made to subprime borrowers -- mainly people with scuffed credit -- as well as many ARMs that fall into the "jumbo loan" category, which currently refers to most mortgages for $417,000 or more, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage-tracker HSH Associates. Also, roughly half of non-subprime ARMs that were originated in recent years are tied to Libor, he estimates.

The higher Libor rates complicate the Fed's efforts to assist troubled borrowers and prevent problems related to the housing crisis from spreading further through the economy.

"The more problems we have in the subprime-mortgage market, the more the likelihood of defaults and foreclosures," says Ray Stone of Stone &McCarthy Research Associates. The federal government has outlined a "rate freeze" program that calls on mortgage servicers to modify certain subprime-mortgage loans to avoid foreclosure.

A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the six-month Libor rate will determine the reset rates for an estimated 99% of subprime ARMs and 38% of Alt-A ARMs in the U.S. that have been securitized. A further 1% of subprime ARMs and 22% of Alt-A ARMs will reset based on the one-year Libor rate. Alt-A is a category between prime and subprime that often involves borrowers who don't fully document their income or assets.

In recent years, lenders began pegging a greater percentage of loans to Libor as more of this debt was securitized and sold to investors around the world, analysts say. Since Libor is a global interest-rate benchmark, investors have an easier time hedging their interest-rate risk because their investments are pegged to a common index, says Bankrate.com's Mr. McBride.

Another factor: Since the U.S. Treasury Department stopped selling one-year Treasurys in 2001, more lenders started tying their hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages to Libor because they believed the Libor index more accurately reflected their funding costs over time than other benchmarks, says Lou Barnes, partner at Boulder West Financial Services, a Colorado mortgage bank.

Other Libor-based loans include certain types of student loans. About half of student lenders peg their private, variable-rate student loans to Libor. The best rates on private student loans are typically prime minus one percentage point or Libor plus 1.8 percentage point, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, a financial-aid Web site. Normally, those rates are very similar, but right now, Libor-based rates are a little bit higher, he says.

That doesn't mean borrowers with Libor-linked loans should jump to other types of loans. Private student loans pegged to Libor, for example, have historically tended to charge a slightly lower rate than loans tied to prime over the life of the loan, says Mr. Kantrowitz.

Homeowners, on the other hand, may be better off in Treasury-linked ARMs over Libor-linked products, if both are available on comparable mortgages. Historically, in times of credit crisis, Libor rates have tended to spike, says Mr. Barnes, the mortgage banker. But Treasury yields at such times often are driven down by investors seeking safe investments, he says.

One bright spot for savers: Higher Libor rates have helped sustain healthy returns in money-market mutual funds. These funds' holdings of Libor-linked debt have helped to offset declining yields on other investments. An estimated 20% to 25% of money-market assets are in floating-rate debt, much of which is linked to Libor, says Peter Crane of Crane Data LLC. That has helped to keep average yields on money-market mutual funds, currently about 4.57%, about a quarter of a percentage point higher than they would normally be in the current interest-rate environment.

The Fed rate cuts have helped borrowers of some other types of loans, especially those tied to banks' prime rate. Average rates on home-equity lines of credit have dropped to 7.60% from 8.25% in early September, while variable-rate credit cards are now charging 13.46% on average, down from 13.97%, according to Bankrate.com.

                          Rate Expectations 
 
  Not all loan rates have tracked the Fed cuts. Here's what to expect: 
 
  -- Borrowers with ARMs tied to Libor aren't seeing much relief. 
 
  -- Yields on money-market funds holding Libor-linked debt haven't dropped 
as quickly. 
 
  -- Expect lower rates on home-equity lines of credit and some credit cards.

 CLMCurrency Trading   HDForex View: Dollar May Stay Steady Despite a Move by the Fed   BYBy Dan Molinski    WC533 words   PD10 December 2007   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC5   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPThe dollar could remain range-bound against the euro this week, and not even tomorrow's interest-rate decision by the Federal Reserve may be enough to budge it.

After shedding 11% of its value against the euro between mid-August and late November, the dollar has seen rather tight, albeit choppy trading in the year's final month.
   TDFed policy makers are likely to reduce interest rates by at least 0.25 percentage point tomorrow. The move could be negative for the dollar because it reduces investors' returns on dollar-denominated assets. But many analysts believe the currency has already been sold down enough, so further sharp weakening may be unwarranted.

Also, the Fed's recent, well-calibrated rate reductions have to some extent been viewed positively for the dollar, as they are seen as necessary medicine to keep the U.S. away from a recession.

"The downside risk to the dollar from Fed easing is limited . . . because the moves are helping to maintain confidence," said Lena Komileva, an economist who focuses on the Group of Seven leading industrial nations at Tullett Prebon. "The slowdown we're seeing in the U.S. economy is not a disorderly one."

The likely rate cut may even give the dollar a boost against Japan's currency, as lower Fed rates could boost stock markets, which in turn increases the risk appetite of currency investors. That drives them away from the low-yielding yen and toward higher-yielding currencies, including the dollar.

But a string of U.S. data due this week could reignite recession fears and provide some negative forces on the dollar.

With all this as a backdrop, look for the euro to trade between $1.45 and $1.47 this week, while the dollar is likely to move between 111 yen and 113 yen.

Late Friday in New York, the euro was at $1.4655, up from $1.4627 late Thursday, while the dollar was at 111.71 yen, up from 111.31 yen. The euro was at 163.71 yen, up from 162.81. The U.K. pound was at $2.0317, up from $2.0265, while the dollar was quoted at 1.1284 Swiss francs, down from 1.1302.

Analysts say the worst-case scenario for the dollar would be if the Fed cut rates by more than 0.25 percentage point.

Interest-rate futures contracts are only giving about 38% odds of a 0.5 percentage-point cut, which would put the benchmark U.S. rate at 4.0%. But if the Fed surprises markets with such a move, the dollar would likely see some short-term selling pressure.

It would also put the Fed's key rate on par with the European Central Bank's benchmark rate for the first time in three years. The ECB left its rates unchanged last week at 4.0%, and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, in comments to the press, maintained a hawkish stance on inflation, which appears to rule out any rate cuts in the near term.

 HDRate Cut Fails To Cheer Market; Fed Sifts Options   BYBy Greg Ip    WC1,354 words   PD12 December 2007   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGA1   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
   LPWASHINGTON -- With a deepening credit crunch threatening to drag the stalled U.S. economy into recession, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time since August, and left the door open to further cuts.

But yesterday's moves, at the low end of Wall Street's hopes, disappointed investors, who had looked to the Fed to do more to thaw frozen credit markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, undoing about a third of the run-up in stocks triggered in late November when top Fed officials first publicly signaled that another rate cut was likely. The blue-chip average ended the day at 13432.77, down 294.26 points, or 2.1%.
   TDThe Fed lowered its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter percentage point to 4.25%. It also cut the discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks, by the same amount, to 4.75%.

Fed officials, however, continue to consider ways of using various tools -- including the discount rate -- to combat banks' unwillingness to lend even to each other, which they view as a threat to economic growth. The central bank could take action within days.

A variety of steps, widely discussed in the markets, are likely to be on the table, including another cut in the discount rate, longer-term loans to money-market dealers, easier collateral rules for loans from the Fed, and other steps last taken in 1999 to alleviate funding pressures ahead of the year 2000, when many feared a "Y2K" computer bug would disrupt markets and create economic havoc.

Changes in the discount rate can be made by the Fed board in Washington without the approval of the entire 17-member policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the federal-funds rate target.

Some on Wall Street yesterday criticized the Fed's actions so far as inadequate. "From talking to clients and traders, there is in their view no question the Fed has fallen way behind the curve," said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley. "There's a growing sense the Fed doesn't get it."

Markets believe a weakening economy will force the Fed to cut rates even more than they expected before yesterday, Mr. Greenlaw said. Futures markets anticipate another cut in January and a federal-funds rate of 3.25% by next fall.

In its statement yesterday, the Fed said that its quarter-point rate cut, which pushed the federal-funds rate a full percentage point below where it stood in early August, "should help promote moderate growth over time."

In October, the central bank said the risks of weaker growth and of higher inflation were roughly balanced, signaling it didn't expect to cut rates again. Yesterday, the Fed declined to give an explicit indication of its next move. It said it will assess financial and other developments and "act as needed." The Fed's language left its options open for its next meeting in late January.

The FOMC's 10 voting members approved the rate cut 9-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren dissented in favor of a sharper, half-point cut. One FOMC member also dissented in October, but in favor of no rate cut. The shift in the dissents, from wanting less rate cutting to wanting more, shows the turn toward pessimism at the Fed.

"Economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending," the Fed said yesterday. "Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks."

Unlike the previous two rate cuts, yesterday's wasn't portrayed as "insurance" against improbable but potentially damaging economic scenarios. That suggests Fed officials view the economy as weaker than they expected as recently as late October.

Corporate executives are also signaling a more downbeat outlook. "I'm not going to put a happy face on this. Consumers are going to be a challenge in 2008," General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt told investors yesterday. But global growth is "as strong as ever," he added.

When Fed policy makers met in late October, financial markets were in better shape than they had been in August, and the economy had just posted a strong third-quarter performance. They chose to cut rates by a quarter point and concluded that would likely be enough.

But in subsequent weeks, markets reversed course as big losses tied to soured mortgage-related investments cut into the capital of major banks and other financial institutions, limiting their ability to lend. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chairman Donald Kohn signaled their increased concern in speeches in late November, foreshadowing yesterday's rate cut.

Even so, investors, who have persistently had a gloomier outlook than the Fed, were disappointed the Fed didn't cut rates more or signal greater willingness to do so. "Well, the boys blew it again. You wonder which economy they are looking at and what it is they are thinking about," said Alfred Kugel, Chicago-based chief investment strategist for investment-management firm Atlantic Trust of Atlanta.

Bond prices shot up yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell sharply. The 10-year Treasury note's yield dropped to 3.97% from 4.1% just before the announcement, while the two-year note's yield, which is especially sensitive to expectations of Fed action, fell to 2.92% from 3.13%. Yields on corporate bonds rose relative to Treasurys.

Major banks, meanwhile, lowered their prime lending rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loan rates, to 7.25% from 7.5%.

The Fed has found it especially difficult to discern the economy's path and thus the right level for rates because the main threat facing the economy is the reluctance of banks and investors to lend to home buyers, businesses and consumers. That's harder to measure than the things that usually drive the business cycle -- such as profits, inventories, employment and the Fed's own interest-rate actions.

Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, said that in 2001 the major shock to the economy was the stock market. "We have a better shot at trying to calibrate those wealth effects, whereas the credit turmoil has many dimensions to it. Frankly it's hard to assess how much economic restraint you get from those various dimensions."

In the past month, data on the so-called real economy have been soft but not dramatically so. Macroeconomic Advisers said yesterday it now expects the economy to shrink marginally during the current quarter, then grow at a 1.8% annual rate in the first quarter of 2008.

On the other hand, credit markets have tightened sharply. Since Oct. 31, the yields on securities backed by auto loans have jumped to 6.3% from 5.4%, while yields on securities backed by home-equity loans have jumped to 7.7% from 6.6%, according to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Rates on "jumbo" mortgages -- those larger than $417,000 -- are around 6.9%, up from 6.6%. The London interbank offered rate, the rate banks charge each other for three-month loans in the offshore market -- is a full percentage point above the expected federal-funds rate; it is typically less than a tenth of a point higher.

There isn't yet evidence these higher rates have significantly bit into consumer spending, outside of housing, and the rates could drop after year-end funding pressures ease. But investors generally don't expect that to happen.

A survey by Macroeconomic Advisers of 55 clients, mostly hedge funds and other sophisticated investors, found most expect little retracement of the wide spreads between yields on risky debt and Treasury yields by next year, and most expect banks to curtail lending. "The possibility of a widespread pullback in credit availability is a significant risk to the outlook," the firm said.

   LPAs Fed Meets,

Recent History
   TDMay Be Portent

With the Federal Reserve meeting today, it's a good time to take a short trip down memory lane to the Fed's last rate-setting decision.

In mid-October, most investors believed the Fed wouldn't be cutting its target overnight bank lending rate -- known as the fed-funds rate -- when it met late October. But as the month ran its course, they began to see a reduction as a sure thing. Stocks rallied. When the Fed came through and lowered the fed-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.5%, they rallied some more.

The next day stocks fell, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.6% lower. They kept on tumbling through much of November.

Likewise, preliminary uncertainty about whether the Fed would cut its target at today's meeting has given way to near certainty that it will lower it by another quarter percentage point.

What's more, there's a growing sense that the Fed will take additional steps to try to break up a logjam in short-term credit markets that's beginning to weigh on the economy.

It's now widely expected that the Fed will also cut the discount rate -- which is the interest rate it charges for the overnight loans it makes directly to banks from its discount window. That's expected to go down by a half percentage point, taking it to 4.5% -- just a quarter point above the expected fed-funds rate.

That could help get money flowing to the financial sector. Right now, financial institutions try to avoid the stigma of borrowing directly from the Fed. It looks desperate. But at 4.5% it might look like good business. It costs roughly 5.25% to get one-month money from other banks.

Stocks have been rallying ahead of today's meeting, just as they rallied ahead of the October meeting, with the Dow up 2.7% so far this month. Now, as then, the risk for investors may not be that the Fed won't come through with the actions they expect, but that those actions won't be the magic wand they desire.

The place to look for this will be in the interbank-lending market. If banks are still charging each other 5.25% for one-month loans after all of the Fed's work, the market could lose its footing once again.

Then there's the economy itself, which is looking increasingly unhealthy. Yesterday, Morgan Stanley economist Richard Berner said he believes a recession is coming. The tight financial conditions faced by borrowers are only part of the problem, he says. The odds are also rising that the rest of the world will slow, which could hurt U.S. exports. And businesses could respond to all of the uncertainty by cutting back on investment.

Mr. Berner's concerns are worth noting. He isn't one of those bears who always predict recessions. And he also tends not to swing for the fences with outlandish calls, just to get attention. He also happened to be one of Wall Street's first economists to forecast the 2001 recession.

The good news is that Mr. Berner thinks the recession will be mild. The bad news is that, with the Dow not far from its peak, stocks probably aren't priced for it.

 HDShares of U.S. railroad operators down after  Federal Reserve  cuts  interest rate    WC209 words   PD11 December 2007   ET20:30   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Shares of major railroads fell in afternoon trading Tuesday, after the Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate for the third time in as many months.   

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate -- the rate commercial banks charge each other on overnight loans -- by a quarter-point to 4.25 percent. Many investors expected a quarter-point cut in the rate, though some were hoping for a larger cut.   
   TDOn Sept. 18, the Fed reduced the rate by a half point to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, and again by a quarter-point, to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent, on Oct. 31.   

Analysts covering the sector have suggested the railroads have not been rebounding as expected from the first two interest rate cuts, suggesting that the freight downturn was worse than expected.   

Here's how major railroads fared in afternoon trading Tuesday:   

Union Pacific Corp. fell $2.46 to $132.80.   

Norfolk Southern Corp. slipped 72 cents to $52.   

Kansas City Southern declined 30 cents to $36.24.

     LONDON (MNI) - European Government bonds opened little changed on 
Tuesday and are treading water ahead of the German ZEW business 
sentiment survey and, perhaps more importantly, the FOMC rate decision 
later today. Bunds have suffered sharp falls in recent sessions in the 
wake of hawkish comments from ECB officials, which have prompted markets 
to re-price risk of an ECB rate hike next year. 

     ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark on Monday said that the 
European Central Bank's Governing Council is concerned eurozone 
inflation could remain elevated despite recent ECB staff forecasts that 
show it declining in the medium term. 

     ECB Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said that the most 
recent forecast by the European Central Bank's staff, which show HICP 
inflation in the eurozone possibly slipping beneath 2% in 2009, is 
"optimistic". 

     European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi 
sounded alarm about the potential for an inflationary contagion from oil 
and food to creep into wages and other prices. 

     The sell-off in EGBs comes after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet 
last week revealed that there were some voices in favour of a hike at 
Thursday's Governing Council meeting, turning the market lower. 

     Elsewhere, JGBs closed lower across the curve overnight as stocks 
extended their bounce, despite solid investor demand at the Y2.0tln 
5-year JGB auction, which was covered 2.86 times. 

     The main focus today is on the FOMC meeting, where markets expect 
the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed funds rate for the 3rd consecutive 
month to 4.25%, amid increased concerns about the US housing market and 
the deepening money market turmoil. 

     The markets have pared back expectations in recent sessions that 
the Federal Reserve may not be as aggressive in cutting interest rates 
as previously thought, in the wake of the solid U.S. Payrolls data on 
Friday, which rose 94k in November vs upwardly revised 170k in October. 

     Some talk in the market is that the Fed will also cut the discount 
rate by 50bps, following US Treasury Secretary Paulson's plan last week 
to help subprime borrowers. 

     The focus is likely to be on the accompanying statement, where 
markets expect the Fed to switch risks from balanced to perhaps 
highlighting downside growth concerns. The Fed may also acknowledge the 
recent fall in commodity and energy prices, and perhaps drop reference 
to upside inflation risks. 

     The Fed funds futures market has fully pricing in a 25bps cut at 
this weeks FOMC meeting and around 28% odds of a 50bps. The Fed funds 
strip is also pricing in further rate cuts at the February 2008 FOMC 
meeting to 4.00% and May 2008 to 3.75%, i.e. A total of 75bps worth of 
rate cuts in H1 2008 and another 45bps worth of cuts in H2 2008. 

     Ahead of this, the Greek PDMA is due to re-open the 4.10% Aug 2012 
GGB issue on Tuesday for E1.5bln size. This auction completes the PDMA's 
2007 funding schedule and adds to the E5.544bln currently outstanding. 
The 5-year benchmark trades at -21.4bps vs swaps and has enjoyed some 
outperformance vs German Bunds in recent sessions, where the 5-year 
GGB/Bund yield spread has narrowed to 25.8bps vs 33.1bps on November 27. 
This issue was last sold on Sept 18 for E1.5bln and then covered 3.44 
times at average yield of 4.24%. Prior to this, the issue was sold on 
May 29 for E1.6bln size and then covered 3.99 times at average yield of 
4.41%. The average bid-to-cover ratio of the last 3-auctions is 3.7 
times. 

     Looking ahead, Germany sells a new Dec 2009 Schatz issue on 
Wednesday for up to E7.0bln -- due to announce the coupon today, which 
is expected to be 4.00%, given the recent cheapening. On Thursday, Spain 
re-opens the 4.00% Jan 2010 BONO issue for an expected size of E1.5bln. 

     Elsewhere, Italy has previously announced BTP auction on Thursday 
has been cancelled, along with the Dutch reserve auction, which was 
scheduled for today. All in all, this supply is outweighed by 
reinvestment flows, where redemption from Germany for E15.0bln and 
coupon payment from Italy E0.75bln -- to turn net cash flows positive to 
the tune of E5.75bln vs -E0.6bln last week. 

     Elsewhere, attention in the Gilts market turns to the UK Debt 
Mangement Office (DMO) annual consulation meeting on Tuesday with GEMMs 
and end-investors. This meeting has been bought forward from February 
and in turn has fuelled speculation that the DMO is looking to prepare 
the market for a reduction in long-dated issuance given the potential 
cut in gilt sales, given less redemptions and the DMO's desire to 
provide liquidity in the 5- and 10-year sector and in the index-linked 
programme in FY2008/09. 

     One of the concerns for GEMMs is that there are some big maturities 
coming up, i.e the 5.00% Mar 2008 Gilt, which has Stg14.928bln 
outstanding, the 4.00% Mar 2009 Gilt has Stg16.974bln outstanding and 
the 5.75% Dec 2009 Gilt, where E12.35bln is outstanding. These 
maturities has prompted concerns about the lack of short-dated paper. 

     Tuesday will likely be dominated by positioning ahead of the main 
event, which comes after the European close, with the Fed interest rate 
decision due around 1915GMT. 

     Ahead of then, European data starts at 0700GMT with Germany 
November wholesale prices, while at 0900GMT, ECB Governing Council 
member Klaus Liebscher holds a press conference to present the Austrian 
National Bank's latest economic projections, in Vienna. 

     UK trade data is due at 0930GMT, though the main European release 
is the December ZEW expectations index from Germany, where the current 
conditions index is seen slipping to 66.0 and the economic expectations 
index is seen slipping to -35.0. 

     US data is overshadowed by the Fed decision and statement, but at 
1245GMT, the ICSC- UBS store sales data for the December 8 week gets 
things started, followed at 1355GMT by the Redbook for the same week. 

     At 1500GMT, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is due, along with 
wholesale inventories for October, while also the ISM is due to release 
its Semiannual Economic Forecast, in New York. 

     As well as the Fed decision, late data sees Treasury Allotments by 
Class for November at 2000GMT and the 2200GMT release of the ABC 
News/Washington Post weekly survey of US consumer sentiment. 

     Overnight tonight, from 0115GMT, US Treasury Secretary Henry 
Paulson is due to make an opening statement at the Strategic Economic 
Dialogue meeting, in Grand Epoch City, China.

     SYDNEY (XFN) - The US dollar was weaker against the euro and pound 
sterling but higher against the yen in midmorning trade here Wednesday, 
after Wall Street shed nearly 300 points in response to the Federal 
Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. 

     While most investors had expected the central bank to lower the 
federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, many had been hoping 
for a half-point cut in the discount rate, as well, to ease liquidity 
pressures in the banking sector. 

     The Fed lowered the discount rate -- the interest rate charged to 
commercial banks on loans they receive from the central bank -- by 25 
basis points. 

     "The disappointment with the Fed's action will see investors once 
again worrying that the credit crunch and housing slump could send the 
US into recession and significantly crimp global economic growth," said 
John Kyriakopoulos, head of currency strategy at NAB Capital in Sydney. 

     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 294.26 points or 2.1% to 
13,432.77 after the Fed's decision. 

     Renewed concerns about the US economy slipping into recession 
eroded risk appetite and prompted investors to reverse yen-funded carry 
trade positions, which had a mixed impact on the US dollar. 

     At 10.25 am (2325 GMT) one US dollar was buying 110.735 yen, after 
falling to 110.62 yen in late New York trade, as investors unwound 
yen-funded carry trades. 

     Euro-dollar stood at $1.466 after slipping to $1.4648 overnight in 
volatile trading, while the sterling was at $2.0347, compared to $2.0338 
at the end of the US session. 

     If the Federal Reserve's decision has a lasting effect on investor 
confidence, the dollar could strengthen against most currencies into the 
end of the year. 

     "There are real fears out there that the credit market conditions 
could deteriorate further into year-end and this could lead to heavy US 
dollar repatriation during the end of year holiday period," warned John 
Noonan, an analyst at Thomson IFR.

     SYDNEY (MNI) - The US dollar was mixed against major currencies 
halfway through the morning session in Sydney Tuesday after falling 
against the euro and sterling in New York overnight as investors 
positioned themselves for a US interest rate cut. 

     The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to lower rates 
at its meeting Tuesday to help reduce funding costs and jumpstart 
economic growth. The only question is by how much. 

     "Another rate cut is virtually a done deal, but the size of the cut 
and the language of the statement are still uncertain," said currency 
strategists at Commonwealth Research. 

     "We continue to maintain that a 25 basis point rate cut to 4.25% 
will occur. Markets have also moved to price out the risk of a larger 50 
basis point cut following the stronger-than-expected US payrolls data on 
Friday, but we view the implied 36% chance still being priced as too 
high." 

      National Australia Bank head of currency strategy John 
Kyriakopoulos said the Fed's accompanying statement will be scrutinised 
for clues on the direction of monetary policy. "Traders will also focus 
on what the Fed says about the credit crunch and its preparedness to cut 
interest rates further in the accompanying statement," Kyriakopoulos 
said. 

     At 10.20 am (2320 GMT), one euro was buying $1.4716, unchanged from 
late New York trade. 

     The 13-nation currency was given a boost overnight after European 
Central Bank policy makers said they were concerned about inflation, 
making an interest rate rise more likely than a rate cut. 

     Sterling was $2.0457, down from $2.0482 overnight. 

     Sterling was pushed higher in New York trade by UK government 
figures that showed house prices accelerated in October, going against 
the trend of other surveys that have shown prices falling in recent 
months. 

     The dollar was trading at Y111.77, up from Y111.66 yen at the close 
of the US session, as demand for yen-funded carry trades tracked US 
markets higher. 

     Wall Street strengthened after  UBS announced a $10 billion 
writedown on the value of investments backed by mortgages, which was 
considered a "cleansing act," said John Noonan, an analyst at Thomson 
IFR. 

     The Swiss investment bank also announced an $11.5 billion cash 
injection from the government of Singapore and an unidentified Middle 
Eastern investor. 

     Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was up at 88.62 cents from 88.46 
cents on improved carry-trade demand. 

     "The near 10 percentage point improvement in our risk-appetite 
index over the past week has helped Australian dollar lift from just 
above 86.60 cents to just under 88.50 cents," said Kyriakopoulos. 

     "However, we suspect that 89.50 will provide stiff resistance 
unless expectations for a RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) rate hike in 
February are resurrected."

NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. 2-year interest rate swap spread jumped out to a record wide on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve interest rate cut disappointed investors, sending many fleeing riskier assets for the relative safety of the Treasury market.   
   TDAfter the Federal Reserve trimmed rates by 25 basis points, stock markets fell, Treasury yields dropped and the 2-year swap spread widened to a record 106.75 basis points, from 92.0 basis points shortly before the Fed announcement.   

The move of the 2-year swap spread beyond 105 basis points was a record wide, said Fidelio Tata, interest rate derivatives strategist with RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut.   

The sudden widening of this spread represents investors' reluctance to own anything except the highest-rated Treasury fixed income securities at a time when risk aversion rises.   

"It's just general disappointment, flight to quality," said Tata. "I don't think anyone wants to be in spread product going over year end." (Reporting by John Parry; Editing by Dan Grebler)

 HD Federal Reserve  expected to slice key  interest rate  for a third time      BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC309 words   PD10 December 2007   ET22:49   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to slice a key interest rate for a third time this year to prevent troubles in the housing and credit markets from sinking the economy.   

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues gather Tuesday, their last meeting of the year, to assess the economy and decide their next move on interest rates.   
   TDAnalysts predict the Fed will trim its key rate, now at 4.5 percent, by one-quarter of a percentage point at that time. A few even speculate about the possibility of a half-point cut.   

On Wall Street, investors' anticipation of another rate reduction gave a big lift to stocks. The Dow Jones industrials jumped 101.45 points to close at 13,727.03.   

If the Fed cuts its key rate, commercial banks would lower their prime lending rate -- now at 7.5 percent -- by a corresponding amount. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans.   

The rationale behind the lower rates is that they will induce consumers and businesses to boost spending, energizing economic activity.   

From July through September, the economy logged its best growth in four years. But it is expected to slow to a pace of just 1.5 percent or less over the final three months of the year as the housing collapse and credit crunch chill consumers, sapping overall economic growth.   

Oil prices, which had neared $100 (euro68) a barrel, have moderated. But they are still high. High energy prices are a double-edged sword. They can slow economic activity and spread inflation if they cause the prices of lots of other goods and services to rise.

 HDUPDATE 7-Copper slips on disappointing Fed rate cut      BYBy Pratima Desai      WC844 words   PD11 December 2007   ET21:25   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Releads, updates with New York closing copper prices, adds U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision)   

LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Copper prices extended their losses in electronic trade on Tuesday after a widely expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve disappointed some investors who had hoped for a more aggressive reduction.   
   TDLead for delivery in three months MPB3> tumbled more than 5 percent to a six-month low of $2,410 a tonne at one point on the London Metal Exchange as the market priced in expectations of higher supplies from Australia.   

Copper MCU3>, used widely in the power and construction industries, narrowed earlier losses and closed at $6,819.5 a tonne nearly unchanged from Monday's $6,825.   

At the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division, copper for March delivery HGH8> settled down 0.30 cent to $3.09 a lb on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division, near the upper end of its $3.0265-$3.1190 session range.   

The industrial metal deepened its losses after-hours to 6.05 cents or 1.9 percent to $3.0325 at 2005 GMT, following the Federal Reserve decision to cut benchmark U.S. interest rates by a modest quarter-percentage point.   

Some traders had been expecting a rate cut of 50 basis points, which could have prompted a strong price rally.   

The central bank's decision takes the bellwether federal funds rate, which governs overnight lending between banks, down to 4.25 percent.   

Traders said activity was subdued ahead of the Fed decision, and    


believed a rate cut would stop speculators short selling -- a bet on
lower prices -- battery-material lead, which has lost nearly 40
   

percent since hitting a record high of $3,890 in October.   

Fundamentally, almost daily flows of copper into London warehouses continued to weigh on market sentiment.   

Stocks of the metal in LME warehouses rose 2,725 tonnes to 191,200, to show a gain of more than 90 percent since the middle of July and nearly 50 percent since early October.   

Part of the reason for rising stocks has been falling demand from the United States, where a housing market slump and subprime mortgage crisis have dampened activity in the construction sector.   

"There's concern about growth next year and markets are reflecting that," said Adam Rowley, analyst at Macquarie Bank.   

"This is a seasonally weak period for demand as well which obviously doesn't help in an environment where physical markets are weak anyway."   

Rising supplies are reflected in the $64-a-tonne discount for cash material over the three-month contracts. That compares with a premium of $75 in early October.   

SLOW MARKET   

News that an Australian state environmental body said on Monday that Toronto-listed Ivernia's plan to export lead through Fremantle port was unlikely to cause any safety issues ID:nSYD105838 has spurred further selling this week.   

"The market is clearly spooked by the prospect of Magellan's material coming back onto the market," JPMorgan said in a note.   

Lead ended lower at $2,520 a tonne from $2,540 on Monday, tin MSN3> was quoted unchanged at $16,700/16,705 and aluminium MAL3> closed at $2,460 from $2,462.   

Zinc MZN3> bucked the falling trend, closing at $2,430 from $2,380/2,385 and nickel MNI3> also gained up $400 to $26,700.   

Elsewhere, base metals markets are tracking stock markets where M&A in the mining sector has become a major theme since London-listed BHP Billiton bid for Rio Tinto, which could mean greater concentration of pricing power.   

BHP Billiton was down 0.3 percent, Rio Tinto lost 1.8 percent, while Swiss-based Xstrata was up 2.24 percent after a British newspaper reported it was open to talks with potential suitors. ID:nL11407175 Metal Prices at 1840 GMT

The industrial metal deepened its losses after-hours to 6.05 cents or 1.9 percent to $3.0325 at 2005 GMT, following the Federal Reserve decision to cut benchmark U.S. interest rates by a modest quarter-percentage point.   

Some traders had been expecting a rate cut of 50 basis points, which could have prompted a strong price rally.   

The central bank's decision takes the bellwether federal funds rate, which governs overnight lending between banks, down to 4.25 percent.   

Traders said activity was subdued ahead of the Fed decision, and    


believed a rate cut would stop speculators short selling -- a bet on
lower prices -- battery-material lead, which has lost nearly 40
   

percent since hitting a record high of $3,890 in October.   

Fundamentally, almost daily flows of copper into London warehouses continued to weigh on market sentiment.   

Stocks of the metal in LME warehouses rose 2,725 tonnes to 191,200, to show a gain of more than 90 percent since the middle of July and nearly 50 percent since early October.   

Part of the reason for rising stocks has been falling demand from the United States, where a housing market slump and subprime mortgage crisis have dampened activity in the construction sector.   

"There's concern about growth next year and markets are reflecting that," said Adam Rowley, analyst at  Macquarie Bank.

"This is a seasonally weak period for demand as well which obviously doesn't help in an environment where physical markets are weak anyway."   

Rising supplies are reflected in the $64-a-tonne discount for cash material over the three-month contracts. That compares with a premium of $75 in early October.   

SLOW MARKET   

News that an Australian state environmental body said on Monday that Toronto-listed Ivernia's plan to export lead through Fremantle port was unlikely to cause any safety issues [ID:nSYD105838] has spurred further selling this week.   

"The market is clearly spooked by the prospect of Magellan's material coming back onto the market,"  JPMorgan said in a note.   

Lead ended lower at $2,520 a tonne from $2,540 on Monday, tin <MSN3> was quoted unchanged at $16,700/16,705 and aluminium <MAL3> closed at $2,460 from $2,462.   

Zinc <MZN3> bucked the falling trend, closing at $2,430 from $2,380/2,385 and nickel <MNI3> also gained up $400 to $26,700.   

Elsewhere, base metals markets are tracking stock markets where M&A in the mining sector has become a major theme since London-listed BHP Billiton bid for  Rio Tinto , which could mean greater concentration of pricing power.   

BHP Billiton was down 0.3 percent,  Rio Tinto lost 1.8 percent, while Swiss-based Xstrata was up 2.24 percent after a British newspaper reported it was open to talks with potential suitors. [ID:nL11407175] Metal Prices at 1840 GMT

 HDANALYSIS-Nervous Corporate America may hasten downturn      BYBy Emily Kaiser      WC779 words   PD10 December 2007   ET21:08   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. employers have yet to slash jobs in any great number and the mighty consumer hasn't forgotten Christmas, but Corporate America is retrenching in anticipation of a slowdown, and that may hasten the fall.   

While malls are packed with holiday shoppers, the import docks in California are quieter than usual as retailers trim inventory. U.S. airlines are flying with the fewest empty seats on record, yet many are cutting capacity.   
   TDSome economists worry that it will be this scale-down in business investment that tips an already wobbly U.S. economy into a recession next year.   

"U.S. housing and consumer weakness are well recognized, but the coming weakness in business capital spending and slowing overseas growth is not,"  Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Berner wrote in a note to clients entitled "Recession Coming."   

Berner said tightening credit terms and falling corporate revenue and profits would lead to weaker capital spending, and international growth probably would not be strong enough to compensate for the domestic slowdown.   

The economy created a net 94,000 jobs in November and hourly wages rose 0.5 percent, suggesting a stable job market, which should bode well for spending. But companies are assuming the worst for consumers grappling with high energy costs, a souring housing market and tightening credit terms.   

"We're not seeing evidence of any significant slowdown (but) we're at the edge of our seats," Ed Bastian, the chief financial officer of  Delta Air Lines , told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington last week.   

Bastian said he was more concerned about the consumer than $90 per barrel oil, and expects U.S. economic growth to slow to an anemic 1 percent to 2 percent next year. As a result, the airline is eliminating some domestic flights and refocusing on faster-growing emerging markets such as Africa and Asia.   

SWOLLEN INVENTORY   

Companies may be keen to pull back before the consumer does because inventory levels are already uncomfortably high. A big buildup in inventories accounted for 1 percentage point of the third quarter's surprisingly strong 4.9 percent growth rate.   

The economy is expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter, partly because companies need to work off that excess. The question is how quickly it will rebound.   

With consumer spending likely to slow and corporate profit growth shrinking, it may be take time to burn off that inventory and encourage businesses to reinvest, setting the stage for a vicious downward spiral.   

"Managers will tend to extrapolate a slowdown in business activity into dimmer expectations of future growth, lower perceived returns from investing, and a reduced need to invest,"  Morgan Stanley's Berner said.   

The potential strains on the consumer are well documented. Berner estimates that steep food and energy prices will have siphoned off $45 billion, or 0.4 percent, from discretionary spending between June and December 2007.   

The weakening housing market and stricter mortgage and refinancing terms are also making it tougher for consumers to cash out home equity, blunting another spending tool. Berner estimated that the housing downturn would subtract 0.9 percentage point from U.S. growth over the next four quarters.   

Retailers' November sales results largely met analysts' muted expectations, although shoppers appeared to be cutting back on discretionary purchases.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the world's biggest retailer, reported strong demand for basics such as food and pharmacy items.   

In another sign that consumers may be stretched, the Federal Reserve said on Friday that debt on credit and charge cards rose at a hefty 8.3 percent rate in October to a record $928.5 billion.   

"With more and more consumers relying on their credit cards for spending, with borrowing standards tightening and bad debt rates ticking up, that could be a serious red flag for consumer spending in 2008,"  Credit Suisse retail sector analyst Gary Balter said.   

That leaves the economy in an unpleasant chicken-and-egg dilemma: Business investment is unlikely to rebound without a pickup in consumer spending, but consumers rely on Corporate America for jobs and wages.   

And both seem to be counting on the Federal Reserve for more interest rate cuts.  Morgan Stanley's Berner expects the Fed to cut at least another full point from its benchmark interest rate, beginning on Tuesday.   

"We may still be too optimistic, swayed by the economic resilience of the past," Berner said. "Insufficient Fed action could again threaten a deeper economic slowdown." (Editing by Tom Hals)

   LP SINGAPORE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Oil slid below $88 a barrel on Monday, extending losses on expectations that a modest Federal Reserve interest rate cut would support the ailing dollar.   

 U.S. light, sweet crude futures <CLc1> fell 47 cents a barrel to $87.81 in Globex electronic trading by 0240 GMT, extending Friday's nearly $2 drop. Prices ended some 37 cents lower on the week, but traded in a wide range of about $5.

 HDFed Expected to Lower Key  Interest Rate    BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC397 words   PD11 December 2007   ET00:12   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to slice a key interest rate for a third time this year to prevent troubles in the housing and credit markets from sinking the economy.   

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues gather Tuesday, their last meeting of the year, to assess the economy and decide their next move on interest rates.   
   TDAnalysts predict the Fed will trim its key rate, now at 4.5 percent, by one-quarter of a percentage point at that time. A few even speculate about the possibility of a half-point cut.   

On Wall Street, investors' anticipation of another rate reduction gave a big lift to stocks. The Dow Jones industrials jumped 101.45 points to close at 13,727.03.   

If the Fed cuts its key rate, commercial banks would lower their prime lending rate -- now at 7.5 percent -- by a corresponding amount. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans.   

The rationale behind the lower rates is that they will induce consumers and businesses to boost spending, energizing economic activity.   

From July through September, the economy logged its best growth in four years. But it is expected to slow to a pace of just 1.5 percent or less over the final three months of the year as the housing collapse and credit crunch chill consumers, sapping overall economic growth. The odds of a recession have grown.   

Oil prices, which had neared $100 a barrel, have moderated. But they are still high. High energy prices are a double-edged sword. They can slow economic activity and spread inflation if they cause the prices of lots of other goods and services to rise.   

The Fed lowered its key rate in September by a bold, one-half percentage point; that was the first reduction in four years. It was followed up by a smaller, one-quarter-point cut in late October. At that time, the Fed signaled that those two rate cuts may be sufficient to keep the economic expansion on track. Since then, however, financial conditions have deteriorated, prompting Bernanke to signal that another rate cut may be needed after all as an insurance policy against undue economic weakness.

 HDGold prices fall after  Federal Reserve  cuts interest rates; oil prices top $90 a barrel      BYBy LAUREN VILLAGRAN      CRAP Business Writer   WC628 words   PD11 December 2007   ET23:10   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Gold prices plummeted in aftermarket trading Tuesday after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 4.25 percent. The dollar bounced higher.   

The Fed's move was widely expected and had largely been priced into the value of the dollar and many commodities; the quarter-point cut disappointed some investors who were hoping for a more aggressive half-point reduction.   
   TDCommodities prices were mixed following the Fed's decision, although some markets were officially closed and trading took place electronically. Precious metals slumped as the dollar advanced, while energy prices climbed broadly.   

Lower interest rates tend to depress a country's currency and drive investors to shift funds to hard assets, like gold. But the Fed's third rate cut this year wasn't sharp enough to shock the dollar into further submission, given that the greenback had already fallen ahead of the decision.   

February's gold contract slid $10.20 to $803.30 an ounce in aftermarket trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after closing up $3.60 at $817.10 an ounce.   

March silver futures fell 24 cents to $14.61 an ounce in aftermarket activity, after closing up 1.5 cents at $14.865 an ounce.   

The dollar gained against the euro while trading mixed against other major currencies. The 13-nation euro bought $1.4652 down from $1.4712 late Monday.   

Wall Street was disappointed by the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones industrials plunged 294.26, or 2.14 percent, to 13,432.77.   

Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst with CMC Markets U.S. said he expects further declines in the stock market and a brief bounce higher in the dollar following the Fed's interest rate cuts.   

"That should weigh on gold a little bit," he said. "I think the FOMC statement ended being more bearish than people thought."   

The dollar's weakness, rooted in declining interest rates, has been a powerful force behind the gains made in commodities markets in recent months. Products priced in dollars -- including oil, wheat and gold -- appear cheaper to foreign buyers as their currencies appreciate versus the greenback.   

Oil prices rose amid expectations that the rate cut will stimulate business growth and demand for energy.   

Light, sweet crude for January delivery jumped $2.16 to settle $90.02 a barrel on the Nymex just before the market close. Gasoline futures added 4.13 cents to $2.2914 a gallon, while heating oil futures gained 4.56 cents to $2.523 a gallon.   

In its statement, the Fed said, "Strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today's action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time."   

Those "strains" include the hefty losses taken by major financial institutions worldwide as a result of rising mortgage defaults.   

However, the Fed also cautioned that "elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation." That could leave the central bank wary of cutting rates further in the future.   

Industrial metals finished mixed on the London Metal Exchange ahead of the Fed's decision, with nickel and zinc pulling higher while copper, lead and tin slipped back.   

Nymex copper for March dipped 0.3 cent to $3.09 a pound.   

Agricultural futures ended in a mixed range on the Chicago Board of Trade, which closed as the Fed released its statement.   

March corn settled up 6.25 cents to $4.24 a bushel, while January soybeans added 9.75 cents to $11.355 a bushel. Wheat for March delivery lost 19 cents to $9.105 bushel.

   LPNEW YORK (AP) -  Bank of America on Tuesday lowered its prime rate by a quarter of a percentage point after the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate.   

Bank of America said its prime rate is now 7.25 percent, down from 7.50 percent. The Fed cut the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 4.25 percent from 4.50 percent previously.   
   TDThe prime rate is what banks charge their best customers, and serves as the benchmark for lending rates to all customers for mortgages, credit cards and other products.   

Most banks typically raise or lower their prime rate by an amount equal to the Fed's rate action within minutes of its decision.

   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Shares of national banks fell even as the Federal Reserve Board cut a key interest rate to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent Tuesday afternoon.   

Banks have been among the hardest hit sector in recent months due to continued weakness in the housing market, deterioration in credit markets and rising delinquencies and defaults among loans and mortgages.   
   TDThe federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other, is often used to calculate interest rates on typical consumer and business loans. The cut will likely be quickly reflected in banks' prime lending rate, making borrowing more attractive for individuals and businesses. That could help offset some mortgage and housing related losses.   

The prime rate was at 7.5 percent and will likely fall to 7.25 percent.   

Here's how stocks of the nation's largest banks were trading following the Fed decision:   

Bank of America Inc. fell $1.21, or 2.6 percent to $45.43.   

Wells Fargo & Co. fell $1.34, or 4.4 percent, to $31.17.   

Washington Mutual Inc. tumbled $1.75, or 8.8 percent, to $18.13.   

Citigroup Inc. slipped $1.09, or 3.2 percent, to $33.68.   

JPMorgan Chase & Co. fell $1, or 2 percent, to $46.42.   

Wachovia Corp. fell $1.79, or 4 percent, to $42.69.

 HDRate expectations at the Fed: Why  interest-rate  changes come as a surprise, and why they don't      BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER      WC859 words   PD11 December 2007   ET22:10   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.

   LPThe Federal Reserve cuts a key interest rate. And the markets go through the roof!   

That's what's supposed to happen, right? But it doesn't always work that way.   
   TDTake Tuesday's quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate -- and the plunge in the Dow Jones industrials that followed. Investors apparently were disappointed that the Fed didn't make a strong statement that it was committed to do whatever was needed to pull the economy out of a slump.   

But something else may have been at play: It's possible that any potential market boost from the cut already happened over the past several days. Wall Street was surging for a couple of weeks leading up to the Fed decision, in part because experts at banks, investment companies and the media saw the rate cut coming.   

How are these predictions about interest rates made? And why does the Fed telegraph its moves -- or, on other occasions, aim to surprise?   

------   

WATCHING THE WATCHERS   

Ben Bernanke: The "Fed watchers" have an eye on you.   

Major banks and investment houses employ their own experts -- known as Fed watchers -- who scrutinize the words and actions of members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which meets eight times a year to set interest rates.   

Public statements from members of the committee -- and from Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in particular -- can offer hints about what might happen at the next committee meeting. For example, if Bernanke says he's worried about the nation's persistently sluggish growth, Fed watchers might smell a rate cut aimed at encouraging investment in the economy; if he says inflation is the biggest problem, he might be looking to slow the economy with a rate hike.   

The Fed watchers also closely follow economic data released by the government. Employment reports, for instance, can offer insight into economic growth and suggest the future course of interest rates. And inflation figures are key, since the Fed is responsible for keeping prices from skyrocketing.   

------   

TELEGRAPHING MOVES   

The Fed often telegraphs its rate decisions, which can cause the markets to react well before the change is made -- and, sometimes, to react more gradually.   

This is often done to soften the economic blow when the committee decides to raise rates. But clues can also emerge before a cut; that's exactly what happened, in fact, before Tuesday's decision.   

In a speech late last month, Bernanke talked about some factors that are giving the economy trouble -- like a troubling credit crunch, rising energy prices and a housing slump -- and said the Fed would need to be "exceptionally alert and flexible." A day earlier, Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said Fed policymakers must be "nimble."   

Fed watchers interpreted these comments as a sign that a rate cut was nigh.   

------   

ELEMENT OF SURPRISE   

Sometimes, the Fed takes a more dramatic approach.   

This happened as recently as September, when the federal funds rate was cut by a half point when only a quarter-point cut was expected. The idea was to give the markets a substantial boost -- desperately needed to shake the market turbulence brought on by a severe credit crunch over the summer.   

Did this work? Well, sort of -- it helped for a time, but a surge in mortgage defaults has recently led to huge losses at banks and investment companies, bringing a new wave of market volatility.   

While an unexpected rate move can sometimes help get the economy moving, the Fed doesn't usually resort to the element of surprise when trying to slow the economy down -- that sort of surprise could send the markets into a tailspin.   

------   

SIGNALS CROSSED   

Whether or not a rate cut can be predicted isn't just a matter of whether the Fed wants to be predictable. The hints from the Fed can be subtle, and sometimes the Fed watchers simply get it wrong.   

That happened this week when investors were correct that the Fed would cut the federal funds rate by another quarter point, but were disappointed in the language the Fed used to describe its action. The investors had been hoping for a much stronger commitment to future rate cuts to protect the economy. When they got a weaker commitment, the pushed stocks prices down sharply.   

There have been other mixed signals over the past two years -- the watchers are still figuring out how to read Bernanke after nearly two decades of interpreting the signals of his predecessor, Alan Greenspan.   

------   

LIFTING THE VEIL   

Subtle as these hints may be, the Fed's thinking has been easier to track in recent years thanks to a push for more transparency.   

The Fed used to operate under a veil of secrecy, but Greenspan and Bernanke have taken steps to provide as much information as possible so financial markets aren't caught off guard when rate decisions are released. Most recently, Bernanke announced that the Fed's twice-yearly economic forecasts would now be released four times a year, and would offer more information than they used to.

 HDHong Kong trims benchmark  interest rate  25 basis points to 5.75 percent following US cut      WC213 words   PD12 December 2007   ET11:00   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPHONG KONG (AP) - The Hong Kong Monetary Authority trimmed its benchmark interest rate by one-quarter percentage point to 5.75 percent Wednesday, matching the overnight rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.   

The territory's currency peg to the U.S. dollar bolts its monetary policy to that of the U.S., and the HKMA generally follows any interest rate adjustments by the Fed.   
   TDHong Kong's de-facto central bank has pledged to keep its base rate -- the reference for lending overnight funds to local banks through its discount window -- fixed at least 1.5 percentage points above the federal funds rate.   

The Fed's policy board cut its target for the federal funds rate Tuesday to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent. The board last cut rates in October, a move the HKMA also matched.   

Local banks are not required to cut lending and deposit rates as well, but usually do.   

Several banks, including  HSBC, Standard Chartered and  Bank of China (HK), announced later Wednesday that they would trim their prime lending rates in Hong Kong by a quarter of a percentage point.  HSBC said it would also lower savings rates.

 HDPhilippine Debt-Yields rangebound, U.S. rate cut priced in      BYBy Karen Lema      WC563 words   PD10 December 2007   ET07:58   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPMANILA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Philippine debt yields are expected to hold broadly steady this week as investors have already priced in a 25 basis point cut in U.S. policy rates, which they expect would trigger a similar response locally.   

Yields in the secondary market slipped more than 8 basis points last week on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut its fed funds rate by as much as 50 basis points. But yields retraced some of the fall as expectations shifted more firmly to a 25 basis point cut.   
   TDTraders said they expected yields this week to range 2-6 basis points either side of current levels, assuming the Federal Reserve cuts as expected.   

"The Fed does not have to cut more than 25 basis points but the probability of not cutting is not high because their problem is deep," said a trader at a local bank.   

The Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and a cut would prime the Philippines central bank to reduce its key rate a similar amount when it meets on Dec. 20, this trader said.   

"So, at the end of the day, if there is a 25 basis point cut (in Fed rates), we are still expecting a cut on Dec. 20 to maintain the interest rate differential."   

The Philippine central bank cut its headline policy rates last month for the third time this year, bringing the overnight borrowing rate to 5.5 percent, its lowest level in 15 years.   

Despite a slight uptick in annual inflation in November, traders said the government was on track to beat an official inflation target of 4-5 percent for this year, giving the monetary authority more room to cut rates again.   

Consumer prices in November climbed 3.2 percent from a year earlier, the fastest annual pace since January when inflation hit 3.9 percent, but the central bank has said price pressures remain benign.   

Annual inflation so far this year has averaged 2.7 percent.   

The government plans to sell 7 billion pesos worth of 4-year treasury bonds at 0500 GMT on Tuesday.

 HDLibor 1-month dollar rates down ahead of Fed decision      WC363 words   PD11 December 2007   ET12:57   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The cost between banks of borrowing dollars fell on Tuesday ahead of a widely-anticipated U.S. interest rate cut, but euro and sterling rates rose, suggesting broader credit market conditions remain tight going into the year-end.   

 The latest British Bankers Association fixings came hours ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, where the U.S. central bank is widely expected to cut rates by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent.   
   TD That would mark 100 basis points of easing since September -- and financial markets expect further cuts to 3.75 percent by August next year.   

 One-month dollar Libor rates fell for a fifth straight session and chalked up their biggest fall since the end of October, when the Fed last met and cut rates.   

 Similarly, three-month dollar rates also posted their biggest fall since October 30.   

 But euro and sterling rates rose, with euro Libor particularly high -- one-month rates rose to their highest since December 2000 and there-month rates increased for the 20th straight session.   

 On Tuesday, one-month dollar rates fell to 5.20375 percent <USD1MFSR=> from 5.23188 percent on Monday, while three-month rates eased to 5.11125 percent from 5.13250 percent <USD3MFSR=>.   

 One-month euro Libor rates rose again to 4.92250 percent <EUR1MFSR=> from 4.89625 percent on Monday, their highest since December 2000, while three-month rates rose to 4.92688 percent from 4.90375 percent <EUR3MFSR=>.   

 Earlier on Tuesday, one-month Euribor rates also rose to a their highest in seven years <EURIBOR1MD=>.   

 One-month sterling rates also rose, hitting 6.73875 percent <GBP1MFSR=>, compared with 6.69500 percent on Monday, suggesting the easing any sterling interbank markets since the Bank of England's interest rate cut to 5.5 percent last week has fizzled out.   

 Tensions have been high in money markets since August as the credit crisis nearly shut key funding channels for banks, namely the asset-backed commercial paper market.

 HDFed drops key rate for third time this year; a disappointed Wall Street tumbles      BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC1,003 words   PD11 December 2007   ET23:34   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve gave borrowers a rate cut present for the holidays. Wall Street's response: Bah humbug!   

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and all but one of his colleagues agreed Tuesday to trim the central bank's most important interest rate by one-quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent. That left the federal funds rate at a nearly two-year low. The action is aimed at preventing a housing and credit meltdown from pushing the economy into recession.   
   TDWall Street, though, thought the Fed was being stingy and stocks took a nosedive. Some investors were hoping for a bigger, half-percentage-point cut. The Dow Jones industrials plunged 294.26 points to close at 13,432.77.   

"This seems to have disappointed some on Wall Street who were looking for a little more in their Christmas stockings this year from Santa Bernanke," said Scott Anderson, economist at  Wells Fargo Economics.   

The rate reduction, the third this year, was needed to energize national economic growth, Fed officials explained. The deepening housing slump is affecting the behavior of consumers and businesses alike, they said.   

"Economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks," the Fed said in a statement. The three rate cuts ordered thus far "should help promote moderate growth over time."   

The Fed left the door open to additional rate cuts; many economists predicted the Fed will be forced to continue lowering the funds rate in the coming months.   

The funds rate affects many other interest rates charged to individuals and businesses and is the Fed's most potent tool for influencing economic activity.   

In response, commercial banks, including  Wachovia and  Wells Fargo, lowered their prime lending rate by a corresponding amount, to 7.25 percent. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans.   

The fact that the Fed's key rate was lowered again marked an about-face for the central bank. At its previous meeting in October, Fed officials hinted that their two rate cuts probably would be sufficient to help the economy survive the housing and credit stresses. Since then, however, financial conditions have deteriorated, prompting Bernanke to signal before Tuesday's meeting that another rate cut may be needed after all as an insurance policy against undue economic weakness.   

As another bolstering move, the Fed on Tuesday also lowered its lending rates to banks by one-quarter percentage point to 4.75 percent. That was the fourth cut to the discount rate since mid-August.   

"Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation," the Fed said in its statement.   

Banks, financial companies and other investors who made loans to people with spotty credit or put money into securities backed by those subprime mortgages have lost billions of dollars. Investors in the U.S. and abroad have grown more wary of buying new debt, thereby aggravating the credit crunch.   

Harder-to-get credit has thwarted would-be home buyers, intensifying the housing collapse. Foreclosures have soared to record highs. The number of unsold homes have piled up. Problems are expected to persist well into next year.   

The 9-1 decision for a quarter-point reduction to the funds rate was opposed by Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. He preferred a bolder, half-percentage point cut.   

"The Fed's language clearly reflects a heightened degree of concern about the economic outlook," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. "They left open the possibility of additional rate reductions," he added. If the economy were to take a turn for the worse, another rate cut could come before the Fed's next scheduled meeting on Jan. 29-30, Tannenbaum predicted.   

The situation poses the biggest challenge yet to Bernanke, who took over the Fed in February 2006. Some analysts have questioned whether he waited too long to cut the Fed's key rate and whether he has acted aggressively enough to soothe the nation's economic woes.   

In September, the central bank dropped the funds rate for the first time in four years. Then it was a half-point drop; on Oct. 31 came a quarter-point cut.   

The rationale behind the lower rates is that they will induce consumers and businesses to boost spending, invigorating economic activity. With Tuesday's reductions, both the funds rate and the prime rate are now at their lowest levels in nearly two years.   

From July through September, the economy logged its best growth in four years. But it is expected to slow to a pace of just 1.5 percent or less over the final three months of the year as the housing collapse and credit crunch chill consumers. The odds of a recession have grown.   

With growth cooling, the unemployment rate, now at a relatively low 4.7 percent, is expected to rise. Analysts expect the jobless rate to climb to 5 percent by early next year.   

High oil prices could complicate the Fed's job of trying to keep the economy expanding and inflation low.   

Oil prices, which had neared $100 a barrel, have moderated. But they are still high. High energy prices are a double-edged sword. They can slow economic activity and spread inflation if they cause the prices of other goods and services to rise.   

"Elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation," the Fed said. "Inflation risks remain," it continued, adding that it "will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully." Some economists believed the Fed's decision to go with a moderate quarter-point cut was a nod to those inflation concerns.

 HDFed works with other central banks to deal with credit crunch, soothing Wall Street      BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER      CRAP Economics Writer   WC886 words   PD12 December 2007   ET19:57   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced a novel approach to injecting money into the banking system as it struggles to combat a severe credit crunch that threatens to drag the country into a recession.   

The announcement helped dispel the sour mood on Wall Street, where investors had pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down by 294 points on Tuesday out of disappointment with what was seen as a timid interest rate cut. After Wednesday's announcement, stocks recouped a part of the previous day's losses.   
   TDThe Fed said it would conduct two auctions next week where banks can bid for up to $40 billion (euro27.26 billion) in loans, money that they will have to bolster their own reserves. It marked the Fed's biggest concentrated effort to inject liquidity into the banking system since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.   

The hope is that the extra funds will spur increased lending on the part of the banks and combat a serious credit crunch that has made loans harder to obtain for many businesses and consumers.   

In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 80 points.   

The Fed linked the new auction process to an announcement that it was extending a line of credit in dollars to the European Central Bank and the national bank of Switzerland so that those institutions could better deal with credit problems in Europe. The Fed said it was also coordinating with the central banks of England and Canada.   

The efforts seek to restore market confidence that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues at the Fed and the monetary authorities in other countries were doing enough to deal with the spreading global credit crisis.   

Private analysts expressed approval of the Fed's efforts, saying they marked a much better response following what they viewed as a botched rate cut announcement on Tuesday. The rate cut was widely seen as not bold enough in light of the serious problems facing the economy.   

"They are trying to help hard-pressed banks raise much-needed cash. The banking system is under severe pressure because the banks don't want to lend to each other," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at  Moody's Economy.com.   

The Fed's new program will begin with two auctions next week and another two in January. The first auction for up to $20 billion (euro13.63 billion) will occur on Dec. 17, followed by a Dec. 20 auction for another $20 billion.   

The Fed is trying the auction program as an experiment to provide another avenue for providing loans to banks because banks have shied away from borrowing from the Fed's discount window because of the stigma that can be linked to banks who make frequent use of it.   

"This is a creative way to try to get more cash into the system without marking anyone as being in trouble," Zandi said.   

In a statement timed before the start of trading on Wall Street, the Fed said it would hold two more auctions on Jan. 14 and Jan. 28. The size of the January auctions will be determined later.   

"This is not about particular financial institutions with particular problems. It is about market functioning," said a senior Federal Reserve official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the actions.   

This Fed official, who spoke to reporters on a conference call, said that the adverse reaction of Wall Street on Wednesday had nothing to do with the timing of the announcement. This official said discussions with other central banks about an enhanced action plan had been ongoing for some time.   

Wall Street investors and private economists generally applauded the Fed's latest effort to combat the country's worst credit crisis in nearly a decade. But private economists said it still was unclear just how successful the auctions would be in overcoming banks' concerns about getting direct loans from the Fed.   

"Clearly, the Fed is feeling its way in the dark here. Current conditions are unprecedented in modern times," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.   

The Fed said that commercial banks would be able to bid at auction for funds that would be drawn from the newly created Temporary Auction Facility.   

The Fed said all banks judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their Fed regional bank would be eligible to participate in the auctions for funds.   

The Fed said that the new auction process should "help promote the efficient dissemination of liquidity" when other lines of credit were "under stress."   

The experience gained from the four scheduled auctions would be "helpful in assessing the potential usefulness" of this new process to provide funds to U.S. banks, the central bank said. Fed officials indicated more auctions would be scheduled if the first four were successful.   

The Fed statement said the temporary swap arrangements being set up would provide up to $20 billion (euro13.63 billion) in reserves for the European Central Bank and up to $4 billion (euro2.73 billion) for the  Swiss National Bank. The reserves would be available for up to six months.

   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve dropped its most important interest rate to a nearly two-year low on Tuesday and left the door open to additional cuts to prevent a housing and credit meltdown from pushing the economy into a recession. A disappointed Wall Street took a nosedive.   

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and all but one of his colleagues agreed to trim the federal funds rate by one-quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent.   
   TDThe rate reduction, the third this year, was needed to energize U.S. economic growth, Fed officials explained. The deepening housing slump is affecting the behavior of consumers and businesses alike, they said.   

"Economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks," the Fed said in a statement explaining its decision to cut rates again. The three rate cuts ordered thus far "should help promote moderate growth over time," the Fed added.   

On Wall Street, stocks tumbled, reflecting disappointment among some investors who were hoping for a larger rate cut. The Dow Jones industrial plunged 294.26 points to close at 13,432.77.   

The funds rate affects many other interest rates charged to individuals and businesses and is the Fed's most potent tool for influencing economic activity.   

In response, commercial banks, including  Wachovia and  Wells Fargo, lowered their prime lending rate by a corresponding amount, to 7.25 percent. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans.

By Mark Felsenthal   

WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Steady U.S. hiring points to economic resilience that will let the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a restrained quarter-percentage point on Tuesday rather than a more aggressive half point.   

Employers added a net 94,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday, and even though revisions subtracted a net 48,000 positions from the count for the previous two months, the report blunted fears of a plunging economy.   

As a result, Fed policy-makers are likely to conclude they are safe in taking out only a little extra insurance to prevent the housing slump and credit market turmoil from dragging the broader economy into recession. A resurgence in credit market turbulence in recent weeks had led financial markets to boost bets of a more aggressive half-point move.   

"In the absence of evidence that the real economy is falling apart, that would argue for the Fed to proceed cautiously with another quarter point," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist for Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.   

Markets fully expect a quarter-point rate reduction at the Fed's Dec. 11 meeting, as implied by short-term futures contracts. But after Friday's employment report, markets scaled back bets for a half-point rate reduction to about 41 percent from 47 percent on Thursday and 65 percent a week ago.   

A Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers, firms that trade directly with the U.S. central bank, found that all of them are counting on the central bank to cut rates a quarter point. Dealers said the jobs data did not justify a bigger move.   

FED FLEXIBILITY   

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chairman Donald Kohn made clear last week that deteriorating credit market conditions since the Fed's last meeting at the end of October spelled rising risks to the economy.   

"These uncertainties require flexible and pragmatic policy-making -- nimble is the adjective I used a few weeks ago," Kohn said.   

Credit conditions remain tight, as evidenced by the gap between the Fed's 4.5 percent target for the overnight federal funds rate -- its main policy lever -- and the three-month dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate, which stands at 5.15 percent. That spread is wider now than in August, when a worldwide bout of credit market turmoil set in.   

Since then, the Fed has cut benchmark overnight rates by a cumulative three-quarters of a point in two moves. They have also lowered the discount rate, which governs direct Fed loans to banks, and taken other steps to make it easier and more attractive for banks to borrow directly from the central bank.   

While the economy grew at a vigorous annual rate of 4.9 percent in the July-September period, the Fed expects slower growth through the end of the year and into 2008, and many economists have said recession risks are on the rise.   

On Nov. 20, the U.S. central bank ratcheted back its growth forecast for next year to between 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent from a June projection of a 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent range.   

PUTTING OFF RECESSION TALK   

Even so, not all Fed officials were convinced at their last meeting in October that a second rate cut was needed to follow up the initial bold half-point reduction of mid-September. And the latest jobs figures provide a sign that, outside of housing and the financial services sectors, the economy is still trudging along.   

"It was certainly healthy enough to put off talk that the economy is careening off the cliff into a recession," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut.   

But some analysts said the report showed a clear slowing trend since mid-year that keeps a large rate cut on the table.   

"The Fed's main focus remains the credit squeeze and liquidity conditions and a slackening labor market will reinforce concerns that the economy is slowing," said Benjamin Reitzes, an economist with BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.   

Some economists say the Fed may trim the federal funds rate by only a quarter-point, but cut the discount rate by a half-percentage point to address concerns about a lack of financial market liquidity. That would put the discount rate just a quarter point above the federal funds rate and could encourage banks to approach the Fed if they had trouble finding funds. (Editing by Jan Paschal)

 LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose above $89 a
barrel on Tuesday, supported by an ice storm that paralyzed
parts of a key U.S. oil hub and as the Federal Reserve cut
interest rates.
   
   TD - An ice storm brought operations at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for U.S. crude to a near standstill and threatened supplies to the region's refineries. [nN11501709]   

 The storm knocked out power to more than 800,000 in the U.S.  Central plains and forced Enbridge  and  TEPPCO to shut more than 20 million barrels of oil terminal storage.    

 Several pipelines, including the 350,000 barrel per day Seaway pipeline from the Gulf Coast, reduced or halted throughput.   

 - The Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a quarter-percentage point on Tuesday to help the U.S. economy withstand tightened credit and a prolonged housing slump.   

 The central bank's decision takes the bellwether federal funds rate target down to 4.25 percent. While the action was widely expected, some economists had thought the Fed might offer a bolder half-point reduction in the rate. [nN11513755]    

 - Adding support for oil, fog along the Texas coast delayed more than 60 vessels from entering the nation's biggest petrochemical ports. Officials said some traffic resumed early Tuesday, but that the fog could return later in the day.   

 - Attention will turn on Wednesday to the latest snapshot of U.S. oil supplies.   

 U.S. crude oil inventories, running at their lowest since March 2005, are expected to have slipped another 200,000 barrels during the week to Dec. 7, according to a Reuters poll ahead of the data. [EIA/S]   (Reporting by Alex Lawler)

 HDECB to lend European banks $20 bln in credit market plan      BYBy David Milliken      WC985 words   PD12 December 2007   ET20:37   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPFRANKFURT, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will lend the euro zone's banks up to $20 billion in an unprecedented move that was part of a global effort by central banks to ease money market tensions on Wednesday.   

ECB Vice President Lucas Papademos said the ECB's move was designed to help euro zone banks which are having trouble finding U.S. dollars to fund investments such as off-balance sheet vehicles.   
   TDThe credit crunch was triggered initially by fears of repayment problems after U.S. home loans, widely packaged foas investment vehicles, hit record levels of foreclosures.   

The ECB's action should provide at least temporary relief to euro zone banks when they need unsecured loans in euros or dollars for periods of a month or more, economists said.   

"It's long overdue and will help normalise conditions, but it's more important as a symbolic gesture than a long term solution," said Lena Komileva, G7 economist at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon.   

Dollar investments have been harder to fund in the wake of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis as banks are wary that their peers might be hiding large undisclosed losses.   

Papademos said the coordinated actions had been planned for some time, and were not prompted by any recent development or trouble at specific banks.   

Komileva said that she had seen some signs in the markets in the days before the ECB announcement that European banks were having to search extra hard for dollar loans, pushing up rates.   

But the announcement was more of a boost to traders outside the money markets than within.   

"Bond yields and equities have surged but there's been very little move on money markets. Term bids have come down but funds aren't flowing," Komileva said.   

Banks needing funds had lowered the maximum rate they were prepared to pay in the open market, in the hope of getting cheaper dollars from the ECB. But there was little trade as banks able to lend funds had not lowered rates.   

SEASONAL PRESSURES   

Seasonal pressures in the run-up to the New Year and underlying credit worries have helped pushed to record levels the rates banks need to pay in London and the euro zone to borrow in either dollars and euros, compared to underlying interest rates.   

To try to resolve this, the ECB will hold two tenders of U.S. dollars before Christmas, open to euro zone banks offering the usual euro-denominated collateral accepted by the ECB.   

Banks allotted ECB dollars will have to deposit 17 percent more collateral than in the ECB's usual longer-term euro tenders to insure the ECB against possible currency losses if they default.   

"It is important to realise that they are not offering free money since all auction funding is to be secured against collateral," Peter Dixon, an analyst for Germany's Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients.   

The last time the ECB did anything similar was after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Then as now the U.S. Federal Reserve entered into a currency swap agreement with the ECB, but in 2001 the ECB allotted the dollars to banks in a faster process which did not involve a publicly advertised tender.   

WILL IT WORK?   

Komileva said that the timing of the central banks' action was fortuitous for them in as much as interbank lending rates would start to ease anyway in early 2008 once the seasonal funding squeeze had passed.   

"Things are about to get better. We're at the tail end of the hump," she said.   

One-month Libor dollar rates <USD1MFSR=> -- the average cost of getting a loan in London -- fixed at 5.10250 percent before the central banks' announcement on Wednesday. At 1738 GMT there were indicative bid/ask prices of 4.97/5.07 percent in Europe, according to Reuters data <USD1MD=>.   

Dixon said that the central banks' action did not resolve the underlying cause of record spreads between interbank loans and risk-free rates.   

"It is likely to take months before spreads begin to narrow again, and will only happen once institutions begin to trust each other once more. And this will only happen when the frequency of write-downs begins to diminish."   

Switzerland's  UBS was the most recent major bank to disconcert markets when it reported a $10 billion write-down on Monday on top of a previously reported $3.7 billion loss.   

The ECB has intervened regularly in the euro money markets since the U.S. subprime crisis claimed its first victim in August, German bank IKB.   

It has succeeded in keeping very short term euro interbank loan rates in line with its 4 percent policy rate. But rates for a month or longer, for which it does not have a target, have surged.   

Under its new plan, the ECB will open the first tender on Dec. 14 at 1430 GMT, and bids close at 0830 GMT on Dec. 17. Banks will learn on Dec. 19 at 1500 GMT how many dollars they have been allotted out of a total $10 billion available.   

The dollar funds are lent for 28 days and are due to be repaid on Jan. 17. Banks do not know the interest rate they will have to pay the ECB when they bid, as it will be determined by the lowest successful bid rate in a subsequent U.S. auction held by the Federal Reserve.   

The second tender, also for $10 billion but with a 35-day maturity, opens on Dec. 19 at 1430 GMT, with bids due by 0830 GMT on Dec. 20 and the results at 1500 GMT on Christmas Eve.

 HDASSET-BACKEDS-ABX indexes reverse gains after Fed   BYBy Neil Shah      WC404 words   PD11 December 2007   ET22:16   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - A key derivatives index tied to U.S. subprime mortgages reversed earlier gains on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve disappointed stock investors with a narrow interest rate cut.

The top-rated "AAA" portion of the 2007-1 ABX index, which references subprime loans made in last year's second half, traded at around 78 compared with Monday's close of 79.67, according to an analyst.
   TDThe 2007-1 ABX's "AA" rated index dropped to 50 from 51.50, while its riskiest "BBB-minus" index is trading at 19 compared with 19.38 on Monday.

The Federal Reserve cut its federal funds rate target for overnight interbank lending by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent.

While the action was widely expected, some economists had thought the Fed might offer a larger 50 basis point cut to help the U.S. economy withstand tightened credit and a prolonged housing market slump.

The ABX indexes had gained earlier in Tuesday's session but started losing some steam ahead of the Fed, traders said.

"I wouldn't expect it to have a major impact," an analyst said, referring to the Fed's decision. Most of the Fed's 0.25 percent rate cut was already priced into ABX levels, he said.

The ABX indexes had also gained last week on the Bush administration's plan to freeze rates for some borrowers with adjustable-rate subprime mortgages.

The plan could be a "net benefit" for investors in securities backed by subprime mortgages, JP Morgan said in a recent report.

It "will reduce cumulative losses for securitization trusts by approximately 2.5 to 3 percent, but bondholders' benefit of lower losses is offset by reduced excess spread, lowering the net benefit to roughly 2 percent," they wrote.

Excess spread is the difference between the interest received and paid out by subprime residential mortgage-backed securities transactions.

Another factor that may be supporting the ABX index is the approach of year-end.

"Some of it is short-covering," an analyst said, referring to recent improvement in the ABX. "You're going into year-end, and some people may be paid differently if they can crystallize the benefit" of their winning trades, for example, by unwinding bets against the index.

 HDAussie dollar recovers from lows, bill rates soar      WC718 words   PD11 December 2007   ET22:40   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPSYDNEY, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar pared some of its overnight losses against the U.S. currency on Wednesday, as investors took a breather from the sell off in high-yielders following the Federal Reserve's decision to trim interest rates.   

Regional stock markets took a tumble amid fears that the quarter-percentage point interest rate cut by the Fed would not be enough to prevent the U.S. economy from slipping into recession.   
   TDAs a result flight to safe-haven assets gathered pace, though Australian December bank bill futures <YBAc1> were sharply lower while term money market rates soared <0#AUBILLS=> reflecting strains in the banking system ahead of year end.   

"The market was looking for confidence from the Fed and it did not get that," said Richard Grace, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.   

"There was a knee jerk reaction to that, and currencies with current account deficits got sold off. But the Aussie was clearly oversold and it could gain from here to around 89 U.S. cents.   

By 4:00 p.m. (0500 GMT), the Aussie <AUD=> was at $0.8755/60, down from $0.8884/87 late here on Tuesday and off a near two-week high of $0.8896 struck in the previous session. It had fallen as low as $0.8710 in New York trade on Tuesday as risk aversion gripped investors.   

The Aussie also recovered to 97.10 yen from a low of 96.24 yen in offshore trade, but investors remained wary of venturing back into carry trades, where they borrow in the cheaper yen to buy higher-yielding currencies like the Aussie and Kiwi dollars.   

Also offering some support to the Aussie was a domestic private sector survey which showed consumer sentiment was buoyant in December, see: [nSYU003640].   

Thursday sees the release of Australia's November jobs report, with a strong number potentially putting the Aussie back on track to retest recent highs.   

A Reuters poll showed market forecasts centred on a rise of 20,000 in employment in November, after 12,900 new jobs were added in October with the unemployment rate holding steady at a near three decade low of 4.3 percent.   

Australia job market has been drum tight, putting upward pressure on demand. However, Australia's top central banker, Glenn Stevens, said on Tuesday the recent rise in borrowing costs stemming from the credit market turmoil could help contain inflation, even without a further rise in official rates [ID:nSYU003638].   

Term money rates continued to rise in Australia, reflecting the tightness in credit markets. The central bank injected A$951 million in cash into the banking system, slightly higher than the banking system's deficit of A$905 million, as it tried to ease some of the pressure in the money markets.   

The U.S. Federal Reserve said it was actively considering all the tools it has available to address liquidity issues, a Fed source told Reuters. [nN11560906]. The slump in the U.S housing sector and the related tightening in credit markets has led banks to turn risk averse and hoard cash.   

Australian bond futures rallied, though not as much as U.S. Treasuries, buoyed by safe-haven inflows. The 10-year contract <YTCc1> surged 0.125 points at 93.825, while three-year futures

 HDTREASURIES-Pause in Asia after post-Fed rally      BYBy Rika Otsuka      WC500 words   PD12 December 2007   ET04:56   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPTOKYO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries paused in Asia on Wednesday, steadying after a rally the previous day when a Federal Reserve interest rate cut was regarded by some investors as being not enough to tackle credit problems.   

On Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield posted its biggest one-day fall in three years, as a quarter-point cut in the benchmark federal funds rate and the discount rate, the Fed's charge on direct loans to banks, disappointed those who hoped for a more aggressive move to help credit markets and the economy.   
   TDSuch disappointment prompted investors to pull money out of equities and shift it to safer government debt.   

"The outcome of Tuesday's Fed policy meeting was a supportive factor for Treasuries as the central bank failed to ease a sense of anxiety towards credit markets," said Hiroki Shimazu, a market economist at  Mizuho Securities.

Traders said some market players locked in profits on Wednesday after the previous day's surge. But bond selling remained modest as Tokyo's Nikkei share average <.N225> tracked Wall Street lower.   

Any signs of more credit tightness are likely to spark more flight-to-safety buying of Treasuries as the year-end approaches, Mizuho's Shimazu said.   

A Fed source said on Tuesday that the central bank is actively considering all the tools it has available to address liquidity issues. Fed officials are not unaware that funding pressures have worsened, the source said. [ID:nN11560906]   

March 10-year futures <TYv1> rose 1/32 to 113-20.5/32. Treasury futures struck a 3-1/2-year high of 114-31/32 in late November when investors started to fret about banks and funds having trouble securing funding before the year-end.   

Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> slid 4/32 in price to yield 3.988 percent, up about 2 basis points from late U.S. trade.   

Two-year notes <US2YT=RR> edged down 1/32 in price to yield 2.940 percent, up 2 basis points from late New York trade.   

Bond prices and yields move inversely.   

Expectations that the Fed will further lower rates next year from the new figure of 4.25 percent kept investors bullish about Treasuries.   

A Reuters survey conducted shortly after Tuesday's Fed rate decision showed 15 out of 18 U.S. primary dealers, the firms that trade directly with the Fed, expect the U.S. central bank to make another rate cut in January. [FED/R]   

Interest rate futures are pricing in the Fed slashing overnight rates to 3.5 percent by August next year. <FEDWATCH>

   LPKUALA LUMPUR, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets slumped on Wednesday as investors viewed the U.S. Federal Reserve's modest interest rate cut as insufficient to prevent the world's biggest economy from sliding into a recession.   

The Fed on Tuesday cut the benchmark fed funds rate by a quarter percentage point to help fortify its economy against a credit crunch and housing slump. But the cut, while expected, was considered modest as the accompanying statement failed to reassure investors that more cuts are coming.   
   TD"Markets reacted negatively to the decision, seeing the latest round of reductions as short of what is needed to spur economic activities and avert a recession," said analysts at Kuala Lumpur-based broker Aseambankers.   

In Singapore, the Straits Times Index <.STI> dropped 1.1 percent to 3,549.25 points as interest rate-sensitive firms like the city state's biggest banks declined following the Fed's move.   

DBS Group Holdings slipped 1.4 percent to S$21.40. UOB Ltd , fell 2 percent to S$20.10.   

Singapore Airlines also fell, down more than 1 percent to S$18.10. Chief Executive Chew Choon Seng said the world's second largest carrier by market value will not raise its offer for a stake in China Eastern Airlines despite speculation that its bid was too low and may attracted rival bidders.   

In Malaysia, the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index <.KLSE> fell 0.7 percent to 1,423.72 points.   

Malaysian power and gaming group Tanjong Plc slipped 0.6 percent to 17.80 ringgit after its third-quarter net profit rose 15 percent to 175 million ringgit ($53 million) and it said it expects improved contributions from its power unit.   

Stock exchange firm Bursa Malaysia slipped 4.5 percent to 15 ringgit after it said that talks with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over a potential collaboration did not involve equity participation.   

In Indonesia, shares <.JKSE> dropped 0.5 percent to 2,795.84 points, as news of a new probe by anti-trust agency, KPPU, into alleged price fixing of tariffs for short message services sent its mobile operators sliding.   

Indonesia's second-biggest mobile phone firm, PT Indosat Tbk , fell 0.6 percent to 9,100 rupiah. State-owned PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk (Telkom), which controls the top mobile phone firm, PT Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel), fell 1.4 percent to 10,950 rupiah.   

The probe casts a new shadow over the sector following a ruling last month over alleged price fixing in mobile phone calls, said John Teja, head of Sales at Ciptadana Securities.   

But Indonesia's No.3 mobile phone operator, PT Excelcomindo Pratama Tbk , jumped 17 percent to 2,700 rupiah after Emirates Telecommunications (Etisalat) agreed to buy a 16 percent stake at a 56 percent premium over its Tuesday price.   

Excelcomindo is 67 percent-owned by Telecom Malaysia .   

"The emergence of Etisalat could be interpreted as a sign of confidence in Telekom's abilities," said Aseambankers analyst Khair Mirza.   

"Etisalat may be interested to broaden its dealings with Telekom Malaysia. We expect some speculation that Etisalat could emerge as a strategic shareholder in Telekom's proposed mobile spin-off, TM International."   

In Manila, shares <.PSI> dropped 1.8 percent to 3,605.59 points.   

Ayala-controlled Bank of the Philippine Islands slipped 3.9 percent to 61.50 pesos. It expects its money transfer business to grow by 10 to 12 percent next year despite a slowdown in deployment of overseas workers, local press said.   

Thailand's composite SET index <.SETI> fell 0.8 percent to 834.09 points as shares of its top oil and gas firms slipped, responding to falling oil prices.

 HDTREASURIES-Bonds fall as joint Fed action lifts stocks      BYBy John Parry      WC597 words   PD12 December 2007   ET14:02   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Updates prices, adds fresh quotes)   

NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury prices dropped on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve joined with other central banks to assuage a global credit crunch, curbing the appeal of safe-haven government bonds.   
   TDThe Fed announced the creation of a temporary short-term lending facility in concert with market-calming actions by several other major central banks. For details, see [ID:nL1290916].   

The initiative prompted investors to pour money back into equities. Stocks had tumbled on Tuesday after the Fed cut the overnight federal funds rate target by a quarter percentage point, disappointing investors who had hoped for a bigger reduction.   

The global central banks' action "was a welcome sign of relief; stocks have taken the news very, very well, although (investors) wish the move (from central banks) had come a day earlier," said Jim Caron, co-head of global rates research with  Morgan Stanley in New York.   

"The initial relief was very good news for short-term lending markets," Caron added. That, along with the recovery of stocks, drew a safe-haven bid out of Treasuries.   

The good cheer that the new measures inspired in the stock market initially triggered the biggest sell-off in benchmark 10-year Treasuries in more than three years.   

The 10-year Treasury note's price fell more than a full point in price, and the 30-year bond retreated more than two full points, before retracing some of those losses as U.S. stocks shaved some gains.   

"Treasuries first sold off on news that the Fed and these other central banks were going to inject liquidity, but now they seem to be recovering on concern there may be more bank losses coming to the market," said Matthew Moore, economic strategist with Banc of America Securities in New York.   

"This plan could limit the flight to quality bid (into Treasuries), but it's not a magic solution" for credit markets, Moore said.   

Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> were off their earlier lows but still traded down nearly one full point in price, raising the yield to 4.09 percent from 3.97 percent late on Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move inversely.   

Two-year notes <US2YT=RR> tumbled 13/32 in price to yield 3.13 percent, versus 2.92 percent late on Tuesday.   

Wednesday's sell-off came after Treasuries recorded their biggest rally in more than three years on Tuesday as investors sought safety amid concerns that the Fed was not aggressive enough in dealing with the credit turmoil.   

The new initiative reversed that flight to quality and had an immediate effect on money markets, which have tightened up in recent months as banks hoarded cash to write off losses related to the U.S. mortgage market meltdown.   

Three-month dollar deposit rates <0#USDD=> at first dropped following the banks' announcement, but then rebounded partially in whippy trade. In another sign of calming credit worries, U.S. interest-rate swap spreads narrowed.   

U.S. interest-rate swap spreads over Treasuries narrowed sharply as investors' risk appetite returned. The 2-year swap spread narrowed to 91.25 basis points from a record wide above 106 basis points late on Tuesday. The 10-year swap spread narrowed to 69.50 basis points from 74.00 basis points.

 HDEmerging debt-Spreads tighten on expected US rate cut      BYBy Walter Brandimarte      WC450 words   PD10 December 2007   ET22:35   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPSAO PAULO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Emerging sovereign debt spreads tightened on Monday, with market sentiment generally supported by an expected interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday.   

Bond prices were little changed, however, as an array of stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data turned analysts more cautious about the pace of future U.S. rate cuts, which are crucial to keep investors willing to take on risk.   
   TDYield spreads between emerging bonds and U.S. Treasuries, a key gauge of risk aversion, narrowed 10 basis points to 223 basis points on the benchmark  JP Morgan EMBI+ index <11EMJ>.   

The spread tightening was a result of another rise in U.S. Treasury yields, after pending U.S. existing home sales rose modestly in October, surprising analysts. Spreads had also narrowed on Friday after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report for November.   

"Treasury yields have been moving up as expectations for Fed rate cuts have been scaled back," said David Spegel, global head of emerging markets debt strategy at ING Bank in New York.   

Despite a more cautious mood regarding the Fed future rate actions, Spegel pointed out that investors' sentiment "remains better than it was before," which translates into a better performance for high-beta countries like Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela.   

Returns on Argentina's bonds jumped 0.93 percent on the EMBI+ as Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner took office as president, replacing her husband. Investors bet the country's main economic policies will remain little changed, as well as its problems, which include high inflation and infrastructure bottlenecks.   

Ecuadorean and Venezuelan debt returns rose 0.71 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, according to the EMBI+.   

In local markets, Brazil's interest rate futures <0#2DIJ:> climbed on concerns the central bank will have to reduce the pace of monetary easing in 2008. The contract maturing in January 2010 rose to 12.47 percent from 12.34 percent.   

Among the analysts reviewing their estimates for Brazil's rates,  Morgan Stanley said it now expects the Selic to fall by not more than half a percentage point in 2008, to 10.75 percent. The bank, which is now forecasting the U.S. will undergo a "mild recession" next year, initially expected the Selic to fall by 1.0 percentage point.   

"A U.S. recession will keep Brazil's interest rates on hold for longer, as it probably worsens the central bank's asymmetric perception of risks,"  Morgan Stanley's analyst Marcelo Carvalho wrote in a research note.

 HDTREASURIES-Bonds surge on falling stocks after rate trim      BYBy John Parry      WC565 words   PD11 December 2007   ET14:21   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Recasts, adds comments, updates prices)   

NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices rallied the most in more than three years on Tuesday, lifted by a flight from stocks after equity investors dismissed a quarter-percentage-point cut in benchmark U.S. interest rates as an insufficient response to the housing and credit crises.   
   TDInvestors shunned stocks and rushed into the safe harbor of highly rated Treasuries after the federal funds rate was trimmed. Some also bet that the shallow decrease would not help to avert a recession and that the Federal Reserve will have to slash rates more drastically.   

Stock markets apparently had pinned hopes on a more aggressive rate reduction Tuesday to slash lending costs and make borrowing easier for companies.   

"Treasuries are extending their gains entirely on stock market weakness," after the Fed rate decision, said Donald Coxe, global portfolio strategist with BMO Capital Markets in Chicago. "When the stock market started selling off, that's when the 10-year note rallied. We are getting a standard safe-haven approach," said Coxe.   

The 10-year note rallied sharply, gaining more than one full point in price. Highly rated Treasuries tap safe-harbor bids when riskier assets such as stocks sell off.   

The 10-year's price climbed 1-18/32 for a yield of 3.97 percent <US10YT=RR>, versus 4.09 percent before the Fed decision and compared with 4.16 percent late on Monday. Bond yields and prices move inversely.   

"I believe we know now there were a lot of people out there who expected a 50 basis points cut and they are taking a lot of money off the table in stocks," said Coxe.   

The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped about 2.1 percent to 13,433 points.   

The Fed trimmed the fed funds target rate, the benchmark overnight lending rate, by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent and also trimmed the discount rate, at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed, by the same amount, to 4.75 percent.   

"What it means for the bond market is positive in that the longer they wait, the less they did (cut rates), the greater the risk of recession," said Bob Millikan, director of fixed income at  BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, North Carolina.   

"It's almost a lack of recognition of the liquidity crunch that's out there," Millikan said. "You can see the reaction of the stock market obviously thinking we need more and we need it sooner," he added.   

The two-year note -- which responds closely to central bank interest rate moves -- traded up 15/32 in price for a yield of 2.94 percent <US2YT=RR>, versus 3.08 percent before the Fed announcement and compared with 3.18 percent late on Monday.   

The 30-year bond <US30YT=RR> gained 2-20/32 in price for a yield of 4.47 percent.   

The U.S. 2-year interest rate swap spread jumped out to a record wide beyond 106 basis points, reflecting rising risk aversion, after the Fed rate trim disappointed investors, sending many fleeing riskier assets for Treasuries.

   LPWASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a quarter-percentage point on Tuesday to help the U.S. economy withstand tightened credit and a prolonged housing slump.   

The central bank's decision takes the bellwether federal funds rate target down to 4.25 percent. While the action was widely expected, some economists had thought the Fed might offer a bolder half-point reduction in the rate, which governs overnight lending between banks.   
   TDIn a related move, the Fed trimmed the the discount rate it charges for direct loans to banks by a matching quarter point to 4.75 percent.   

The Fed has now cut overnight rates, their key economic policy lever, by a full percentage point since mid-September in an effort to put a floor under an economy increasingly seen at risk of falling into recession. (Reporting by Mark Felsenthal and David Lawder; Editing by Tim Ahmann)

 HDUS RATE FUTURES-Confident of another 25 bps Fed ease in Jan      BYBy Ros Krasny      WC390 words   PD11 December 2007   ET23:02   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP  (Updates prices, adds details, comments)   
   TD NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. financial markets quickly refocused on the potential for more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts after a brief wobble when the central bank trimmed its benchmark lending rate by less than some had hoped.   

 Short-term interest rate futures fully price another quarter-percentage point rate cut at the Fed's next Jan. 29-30, 2008 meeting, to 4 percent, and expect rates to be closer to 3.75 percent by mid-2008.   

 "The economy continues to deteriorate, so this cut is unlikely to be the last," said Kurt Karl, chief economist at  Swiss Re in New York.   

 Futures' brief dip ended as U.S. equities prices got savaged and Treasury debt prices surged after the Fed's decision and its comment that economic growth is slowing and uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook has increased.   

 "The change in their thinking is all about the gathering economic weakness and the risk of plunging into recession," said Brian Fabbri, economist at  BNP Paribas in New York.   

 As a result, the Fed's statement was seen as a hint that more rate cuts surely lie ahead.   

 Policy-makers voted 9-1 in favor of the quarter-percentage point rate cut. But in contrast to a series of dissents by hawkish policy-makers over the past year, Tuesday's dissent from rookie Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, called for a half-point cut.   

 "Well done, sir," Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, said of Rosengren's dissent.   

 The FOMC has cut rates by a total of 100 basis points since mid-September, "one of the most rapid periods of monetary ease and only equaled or exceeded when the economy has been in recession," Fabbri said.   

 Many forecasters expect the terminal point of the current easing cycle to be 3 percent to 3.5 percent compared with the current 4.25 percent.   

Swiss Re's Karl said the risk of recession is currently about 45 percent over the next year due to weak growth, financial market turbulence and high oil prices.  (Editing by Gary Crosse)

 HDTREASURIES-Edge up in Asia before expected Fed rate cut      BYBy Eric Burroughs      WC612 words   PD11 December 2007   ET06:18   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPTOKYO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries edged up in Asia on Tuesday, recovering from a three-day slide as investors waited to see what the Federal Reserve would signal on the policy outlook after a widely expected interest rate cut later in the day.   

The Fed is still widely seen trimming rates by a quarter-point to 4.25 percent, which would take its total monetary easing since September to a full percentage point.   
   TDThe drop in Treasuries has lifted two-year yields from a four-year low after data showing resilience in employment and a pick-up in pending home sales doused speculation the Fed might opt for a half-point cut.   

Analysts said the Fed may try again to temper market expectations for repeated rate cuts in coming months as the central bank tries to stave off a sharper economic slowdown and ease the strains hobbling money markets.   

Investors are trying to determine whether the U.S. economy is headed for a recession that would require deep rate cuts, as in 2001 and 2002, or whether growth will recover and the Fed will be done after a few rate cuts, as in 1998.   

"You don't know whether it's a severe recession or not. And if it's not a severe recession, then it's 1998 all over again," said a trader at a U.S. investment bank in Tokyo. "You don't know how deep it's going to be." After its last meeting in late October, the Fed said its cumulative monetary easing should help forestall the economy's housing-led downturn and repeated that inflation risks remain.   

Interest rate futures are pricing in the Fed slashing overnight rates to 3.5 percent by August next year. <FEDWATCH>   

March 10-year futures <TYv1> were flat at 112-12/32 and have fallen back from a 3-1/2-year high of 114-31/32 hit in late November when investors started to fret about banks and funds having trouble securing funding in money markets before the year-end.   

Market players were comforted on Monday by the latest cash injections into financial institutions bleeding from subprime mortgage-related losses, with bond insurer MBIA receiving $1 billion in capital and Swiss bank  UBS raising nearly $12 billion.   

Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> climbed 5/32 in price to yield 4.145 percent, down about a basis point from late U.S. trade. Two-year notes <US2YT=RR> were flat to yield 3.179 percent, up from a four-year low of 2.80 percent hit last week.   

Money market conditions remain tight heading into the Fed's expected rate cut, with some analysts expecting the central bank to potentially trim its discount rate for direct lending to banks by a half-point to help relieve the stress.   

The spread of three-month LIBOR <LIBOR> over the federal funds rate target -- a gauge of liquidity in the interbank system -- has dipped about 2 basis points in the past week to 63 basis points, though it has widened from 37 basis points in mid-November.   

Before the severe money market strains erupted in August, the spread had been about 10 basis points.   

The two-year swap spread <SMKR99>, a measure of financial system risk, was steady at 97.25 basis points and has shrunk back after having pushed out last week towards record wides hit last month around 105 basis points. (Editing by Michael Watson)

 HDEURO CORP-Credit spreads tighten on SIVs, US rate cut hopes      BYBy Natalie Harrison      WC554 words   PD11 December 2007   ET17:49   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPLONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - European credit spreads were tighter on Tuesday in a brighter mood ahead of an expected U.S. interest rate cut and increased confidence as banks work out problems with structured investment vehicles (SIVs).   

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by a quarter-percentage point, or perhaps more, from 4.5 percent, to strengthen the economy against a credit crunch and housing slump. The decision is due at 1915 GMT.   
   TDBy 1615 GMT, the iTraxx Crossover index <ITCRS5EA=GFI>, made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, was at 335 basis points, according to data from Markit, 6 basis points tighter versus late on Monday.   

The Crossover index has not hit such low levels since Nov. 1, the day after the Fed's last interest rate decision when it cut rates by 25 basis points.   

The investment-grade iTraxx Europe index <ITRAC5EA=GFI> was at 51.25 basis points, 1.75 basis points tighter.   

"We've given a little bit back but we're still tighter," said Suki Mann, a credit strategist at SG CIB. "The mood is quite upbeat, everyone is pretty much expecting a Fed cut of 25 basis points and perhaps up to a 50 basis points cut in the discount rate."   

A reduction in the discount rate -- the amount the Fed charges for direct loans to banks -- might help ease liquidity problems within the financial sector.   

"The general newsflow has also been a bit more positive with the equity injections in SIVs. There was a better tone at the open today," added Mann.   

A growing number of banks in recent weeks have announced plans to try to help SIVs survive the credit market turmoil.   

Citigroup has reduced the size of its SIV by more than $15 billion in the past two months, the Financial Times said on Tuesday.   

UBS was in the spotlight again on Tuesday, just a day after the Swiss bank announced writedowns on subprime mortgage exposures and a capital injection from the  Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and an unnamed Middle East investor to bolster its sagging balance sheet.   

UBS CEO Marcel Rohner said that the bank was now protected against all scenarios and would not have to hike capital again after a large capital injection. The statement gave a lift to sentiment and supported financials' credit spreads.   

In an otherwise quiet market, bid speculation pushed the cost of insuring Swiss specialty chemicals group  Clariant's debt against default higher.   

Five-year credit default swaps on  Clariant were 15 basis points wider at 98 basis points, according to  Deutsche Bank prices, on bid rumours, traders said.   

Clariant was the subject of takeover speculation back in May, with talk it might be a target for Germany's Lanxess . Five-year CDS on Lanxess were also 15 basis points wider at 82.5 basis points.   

The Swiss speciality chemicals group said on Tuesday it was likely that it would divest unattractive businesses following a review of its portfolio, the conclusions of which it will announce in the first quarter.   

The comments were made in a slide presentation prepared for a conference starting Wednesday.

 HDCanadian dollar lower after Fed rate cut, bonds up      BYBy John McCrank      WC606 words   PD11 December 2007   ET23:00   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPTORONTO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar sagged against a firmer U.S. dollar on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its bellwether interest rate by a quarter percent, which was less than some in the market had been anticipating.   

Canadian bond prices, with no domestic data to influence moves, rallied along with the larger U.S. Treasury market as stock markets fell on the Fed's announcement.   
   TDThe Canadian dollar closed at 98.58 U.S. cents, valuing a U.S. dollar at C$1.0144, down from Monday's session close of 99.41 U.S. cents, or C$1.0059.   

"The market has rendered its verdict and it's given the Fed's modest rate cut a big thumbs down," said Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.   

The Fed cut its key fed funds rate to 4.25 percent to help guide the U.S. economy through trouble in the global credit markets and the U.S. housing downturn.   

The Fed also trimmed a quarter point off its discount rate, which it charges for direct loans to banks, to 4.75 percent.   

But many market players had been calling for 50 basis point cuts to both the fed funds rate and the discount rate.   

In general, when a country's interest rates come down, its currency is seen as less attractive. But since the Fed did not cut as deeply as some expected, the greenback was given a boost, which may turn out to be only temporary, Porter said.   

"I think, in fact, what we might see some renewed concerns about the U.S. economy to come to the fore in the next couple of days and that might actually begin to undercut the U.S. dollar."   

"The weakness in stocks may come back and undercut the U.S. dollar down the line."   

Equities markets plunged after the Fed announcement, with Toronto stocks ending more than 200 points lower and the Dow Jones industrial average shedding nearly 300 points.   

Key U.S. and Canadian interest rates are now at the same 4.25 percent level.   

In its accompanying statement, the Fed did leave the door open for further cuts down the road.   

BONDS RALLY   

Canadian bond prices rallied as investors fled the equities markets after the U.S. interest rate announcement.   

"I think the bond market thinks the Fed has made a colossal mistake today," said Eric Lascelles, chief economics and rates specialist at TD Securities.   

"That is, in underestimating the scope of the economic situation in such (a way) that the economy is presumed more likely to slow more drastically now and the market thinks the Fed is going to have to cut by more later to compensate for what is being viewed as a policy error today."   

The two-year bond gained 24 Canadian cents to C$101.17 to yield 3.628 percent. The 10-year bond added C$1.06 to C$100.54 to yield 3.931 percent.   

The yield spread between the two-year and 10-year bond moved to 30.3 basis points from 30.7 at the previous close.   

The 30-year bond increased C$2.08 to C$115.51 to yield 4.089 percent. In the United States, the 30-year Treasury yielded 4.471 percent.   

The three-month when-issued T-bill yielded 3.86 percent, down from 3.90 percent at the previous close.

 HDUS currency sinks with  Federal Reserve  rate-cut expected Tuesday      WC297 words   PD10 December 2007   ET22:37   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - The dollar slid against most major currencies Monday with markets awaiting a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve about a possible third interest rate cut this year.   

The 13-nation euro bought $1.4712 in late New York trading, up from $1.4655 late Friday.   
   TDThe British pound was a little higher, climbing to $2.0462 from $2.0315. The dollar fell to 111.67 Japanese yen from 111.69 yen Friday.   

The Fed meets Tuesday to discuss interest rates, with analysts expecting the U.S. central bank to trim its key rate, now at 4.5 percent, by a quarter of a percentage point. Some have speculated about the possibility of a half-point cut.   

The expected cut would be the third amid mortgage problems in the U.S. that have tripped up borrowers and caused a credit crisis among banks -- fueling wider fears about the health of the U.S. economy.   

Lower interest rates can jump-start an economy, but they can also weaken a currency as investors transfer funds to countries where they can earn higher returns.   

If the U.S. does cut rates, it will follow in the footsteps of the Bank of England, which last week cut its benchmark rate to 5.5 percent from 5.75 percent. Canada's central bank also cut its rate to 4.25 percent.   

The European Central Bank kept its rate unchanged at 4 percent last week but appeared to set the stage for a possible rate decrease sometime in early 2008.   

The dollar fell to 1.1282 Swiss francs late Monday from 1.1292 francs. The U.S. currency rose to 1.0073 Canadian dollars, up from 1.0045 Friday.

 HDDollar slips as Fed, other central banks announce plan to provide dollars to European banks      BYBy ERIN CONROY      CRAP Business Writer   WC553 words   PD12 December 2007   ET22:51   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - The dollar traded slightly lower against the euro Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a plan to work with other central banks to alleviate a global credit crisis.   

The announcement about the Fed's cooperation with the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the  Swiss National Bank appeared to cool the euro's rise in the aftermath of the Fed's quarter-point rate cut Tuesday.   
   TDIt also offset news that the U.S. trade deficit hit a three-month high and the Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate for the third time this year.   

The U.S. central bank said that it would conduct two auctions next week where banks can bid for up to $40 billion in loans, money they can use to bolster their own reserves. It was also setting up lines of credit with the ECB and the Swiss Central Bank that could be used to deal with credit problems in Europe. The credit lines are expected to give European banks easier access to dollar funds.   

It marked the Fed's biggest concentrated effort to inject liquidity into the banking system since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.   

The 13-nation euro bought $1.4720 in afternoon New York trading, up from $1.4675 late Tuesday. The British pound also rose to $2.0471 from $2.0356.   

The increases came after the U.S. Commerce Department said that the U.S. trade deficit rose to $57.8 billion in October, its highest level since July, with record oil prices and a flood of toys and other imports from China swamping a solid gain in American exports.   

The dollar climbed to 112.13 Japanese yen from 110.82 yen. The U.S. currency rose to 1.1336 Swiss francs from 1.1319 francs, and rose to 1.0131 Canadian dollars from 1.0130 Tuesday.   

David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., said the Fed's decision drew traders into the yen-carry trade. Carry trades involve borrowing currencies from countries with low interest rates and investing the funds in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. Carry-trade beneficiaries are usually the euro and emerging-market currencies such as the New Zealand kiwi.   

The Fed on Tuesday cut its benchmark federal funds rate to 4.25 percent and signaled that more cuts were possible if a severe downturn in the housing market and a crisis in mortgage lending worsen.   

The central bank also reduced its discount rate, the interest it charges to make direct loans to banks, by a quarter-point to 4.75 percent.   

The cut was the third since September amid mortgage problems in the U.S. that have tripped up borrowers and caused a credit crisis among banks -- fueling wider fears about the health of the U.S. economy.   

Lower interest rates can jump-start an economy, but they can also weaken a currency as investors transfer funds to countries where they can earn higher returns.   

Last week, the Bank of England cut its benchmark rate to 5.5 percent from 5.75 percent, but the European Central Bank left its rate unchanged at 4 percent.

 HDGold Stumbles Following Rate Cut      BYBy LAUREN VILLAGRAN      CRAP Business Writer   WC618 words   PD11 December 2007   ET23:10   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Gold prices plummeted in aftermarket trading Tuesday after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 4.25 percent. The dollar bounced higher.   

The Fed's move was widely expected and had largely been priced into the value of the dollar and many commodities; the quarter-point cut disappointed some investors who were hoping for a more aggressive half-point reduction.   
   TDCommodities prices were mixed following the Fed's decision, although some markets were officially closed and trading took place electronically. Precious metals slumped as the dollar advanced, while energy prices climbed broadly.   

Lower interest rates tend to depress a country's currency and drive investors to shift funds to hard assets, like gold. But the Fed's third rate cut this year wasn't sharp enough to shock the dollar into further submission, given that the greenback had already fallen ahead of the decision.   

February's gold contract slid $10.20 to $803.30 an ounce in aftermarket trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after closing up $3.60 at $817.10 an ounce.   

March silver futures fell 24 cents to $14.61 an ounce in aftermarket activity, after closing up 1.5 cents at $14.865 an ounce.   

The dollar gained against the euro while trading mixed against other major currencies. The 13-nation euro bought $1.4652 down from $1.4712 late Monday.   

Wall Street was disappointed by the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones industrials plunged 294.26, or 2.14 percent, to 13,432.77.   

Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst with CMC Markets U.S. said he expects further declines in the stock market and a brief bounce higher in the dollar following the Fed's interest rate cuts.   

"That should weigh on gold a little bit," he said. "I think the FOMC statement ended being more bearish than people thought."   

The dollar's weakness, rooted in declining interest rates, has been a powerful force behind the gains made in commodities markets in recent months. Products priced in dollars -- including oil, wheat and gold -- appear cheaper to foreign buyers as their currencies appreciate versus the greenback.   

Oil prices rose amid expectations that the rate cut will stimulate business growth and demand for energy.   

Light, sweet crude for January delivery jumped $2.16 to settle $90.02 a barrel on the Nymex just before the market close. Gasoline futures added 4.13 cents to $2.2914 a gallon, while heating oil futures gained 4.56 cents to $2.523 a gallon.   

In its statement, the Fed said, "Strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today's action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time."   

Those "strains" include the hefty losses taken by major financial institutions worldwide as a result of rising mortgage defaults.   

However, the Fed also cautioned that "elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation." That could leave the central bank wary of cutting rates further in the future.   

Industrial metals finished mixed on the London Metal Exchange ahead of the Fed's decision, with nickel and zinc pulling higher while copper, lead and tin slipped back.   

Nymex copper for March dipped 0.3 cent to $3.09 a pound.   

Agricultural futures ended in a mixed range on the Chicago Board of Trade, which closed as the Fed released its statement.   

March corn settled up 6.25 cents to $4.24 a bushel, while January soybeans added 9.75 cents to $11.355 a bushel. Wheat for March delivery lost 19 cents to $9.105 bushel.

 HDEuroLinks Daily View: Fed Leaves Door Open to More Cuts      BYBy Michael Connolly      WC1,126 words   PD11 December 2007   SNThe Wall Street Journal Online   SCWSJO   LAEnglish   CYCopyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.   
   LPIn the U.S. Federal Reserve's statement accompanying two 0.25-percentage-point interest-rate cuts Tuesday, Fed policy makers didn't -- as they did in October -- deem the risks of weaker growth and higher inflation to be in rough balance. That message was a signal that the Fed didn't expect to cut rates again.   

Instead, this time they pledged to "continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects" and to "act as needed." By avoiding any explicit hint of their next move on rates, as Greg Ip reports, they left options open for their meeting in late January. In fact, the Fed in coming days could further cut the discount rate -- charged on direct Fed loans to commercial banks -- if it deems it necessary.   
   TDYet given that excess liquidity and credit led to the real-estate bubble in the first place, how much more quickly does the Fed want to cut? Indeed, other policy tools could be wheeled out after further Fed study. Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan writes in a commentary on our opinion pages that over the past five years, risk has become increasingly underpriced as market euphoria, fostered by an unprecedented global growth rate, gained cumulative traction. He says the current credit crisis will come to an end when the overhang of inventories of newly built homes is largely liquidated, and home price deflation comes to an end.   

Nonetheless, the rate cuts come as the U.S. economy, which grew at an annual rate of 4.9% in the third quarter, appears to have ground to a halt in the current quarter, under the weight of the housing slump, as well as higher energy prices and slowing job growth, which have curbed consumer spending. Investors who had hoped for bigger cuts sent the Dow Jones industrials to their biggest decline in more than a month -- 294.26 points, or 2.1%.

NEW CITIGROUP TEAM: Vikram Pandit takes the helm at  Citigroup Inc. at a time when the U.S. financial-services giant is battling enormous difficulties that range from massive losses tied to the mortgage crisis to a lackluster consumer business in the U.S. A former president and chief operating officer of  Morgan Stanley's powerful institutional-securities and investment-banking group, Mr. Pandit joined  Citigroup earlier this year when the bank bought the hedge fund he had started less than a year earlier, Old Lane Partners, for some $800 million.   

While the 50-year-old native of India, who holds several degrees from Columbia University, has strong credentials in capital markets, he has little experience with consumer banking or in heading a large corporation. As Robin Sidel and David Enrich report, he is expected to make major structural changes that are already under consideration. Some business lines may be cut and others reorganized, and a broad cost-cutting plan to supplement one initiated by Mr. Prince is likely.   

Sir Win Bischoff, 66,  Citigroup's new chairman, who also emigrated to the company through acquisition, had been chairman of London-based merchant bank  Schroders PLC, which  Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit bought in 2000. Born in Germany, raised in South Africa and knighted in England, he began his banking career in the international division of the Rockefeller-family controlled Chase Manhattan Bank in 1962. His broad international experience should be helpful to  Citigroup at a time when both commercial and investment banks are drawing a growing amount of revenue from outside the U.S.

KREMLIN QUID PRO QUO: Dmitry Medvedev, Vladimir Putin's handpicked successor to Russia's presidency, invited Mr. Putin on Tuesday to become his prime minister if he is elected in March. But some analysts dismissed it as a ploy to boost Mr. Medvedev's popularity while ensuring Mr. Putin doesn't become a lame duck.   

Certainly Mr. Putin, 55, has made clear that he intends to remain a powerful figure -- saying in October that the prospect of becoming prime minister after his term ends next spring "is an entirely realistic proposal" -- but so far he hasn't indicated whether Mr. Medvedev's proposal is how he intends to proceed. Nonetheless, as Alan Cullison and Andrew Osborn report, such a job shuffle at the top of the Kremlin hierarchy would appear to resolve a power struggle in Mr. Putin's inner circle, which is laden with security-service veterans who have grown nervous as elections approach.   

Some had feared that Mr. Medvedev -- a 42-year-old lawyer with no apparent KGB background and who is thought to be a representative of the Kremlin's liberal wing -- wouldn't be able to keep the security-service cadre in check. But with Mr. Putin as prime minister, he would have a powerful ally against the security-service clans.

ARAB BUSINESS BOOM: Long the biggest spigot for crude oil, Saudi Arabia now has broader ambitions, wanting to become a big exporter of chemicals, aluminum and plastic, and in the process create jobs. As a result, the country is on a building binge, with Saudi government construction projects expected to consume $600 billion over the next dozen years. But, as Neil King Jr. reports, they will also consume something else: large quantities of Saudi oil -- oil that otherwise could help slake other countries' growing thirst. Meanwhile, Cassell Bryan-Low and Mariam Fam report that even though Egypt may not have the petrodollars that other big Arab countries use to buy foreign assets, it does have the Sawiris, the country's most prominent business family. And by agreeing this week to sell Orascom group's cement company to  Lafarge SA in a deal valued at about $12.95 billion, Nassef Sawiris has broken into France, one of the toughest markets for an outsider to crack.

   LP SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index <.STI> fell more than 2 percent in opening trade on Wednesday, as a disappointing U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut renewed fears of a slowdown in the world's largest economy.   

 By 0101 GMT, the STI was down 2.1 percent to 3,513.49 points, weighed down by a 3.2 percent fall in DBS Group  and a 2.9 percent drop in United Overseas Bank .   
   TD U.S. stocks sank on Tuesday after the U.S. central bank trimmed interest rates rather than slashing them, letting down investors who fear the economy might slip into recession unless the central bank becomes more aggressive. [ID:nN11560375]

 LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The cost of borrowing dollars on the interbank market fell on Wednesday following the previous day's U.S. interest rate cut, but euro and sterling rates rose again, suggesting credit market stress shows no sign of easing.   
   TD The latest British Bankers Association fixings were the first since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent and offered no clear signals of more easing to come, which disappointed many analysts.   

 One-month dollar Libor rates fell for a sixth straight session and chalked up their biggest fall since September 19, also the day after the Fed cut rates.   

 But euro and sterling rates rose again, with euro Libor particularly high -- three-month rates increased for the 21st straight session and posted their biggest gain this month, while one-month rates hit their highest since December 2000.   

 On Wednesday one-month dollar Libor fell to 5.10250 percent from 5.20375 percent <USD1MFSR=> on Tuesday, and three-month rates eased to 5.05750 percent from 5.11125 percent <USD3MFSR=>.   

 One-month euro Libor rates rose to 4.94500 percent from 4.92250 percent <EUR1MFSR=> on Tuesday, their highest since December 2000, while three-month rates rose to 4.95250 percent from 4.92688 percent <EUR3MFSR=>.   

 One-month sterling rates also rose, hitting 6.74625 percent compared with 6.73875 percent <GBP1MFSR=> on Tuesday, while three-month rates rose to 6.62688 percent from 6.62500 percent <GBP3MFSR=>.   

 Tensions have been high in money markets since August as the credit crisis nearly shut key funding channels for banks, namely the asset-backed commercial paper market.

 HDASSET-BACKEDS-ABX higher but market still cautious      BYBy Dena Aubin      WC532 words   PD10 December 2007   ET22:00   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Benchmark ABX subprime mortgage indexes were slightly higher on Monday, extending last week's gains on the Bush administration's plan to freeze rates for subprime mortgage borrowers facing foreclosure.   

Performance of the ABX indexes varied, however, depending on the vintage of loans in the index and the market's view of how each might be affected by the plan, a trader said.   
   TDThe "AAA" slice of the ABX 06-2 index was up about one point at 89, the "AA" slice rose about 1 point to about 69.5, and the "A" slice was up about 2.25 points to about 48.75, the trader said.   

Capital infusions into  UBS and  MBIA Inc. were also positive for the ABS market, though their impact was muted by ongoing worries that more fallout from the subprime crisis still lies ahead, the trader said.   

"We're just starting to get through the mess we've created," said the trader.   

UBS on Monday announced an emergency injection of funds from Singapore and the Middle East as it revealed a $10 billion subprime-linked write-down, while buyout firm Warburg Pincus agreed to invest $1 billion in bond insurer MBIA. For details see [ID:nL10498915] and [ID:nN10414026].   

In a sign of the market's jitters, just two new issues priced last week for a total of $2.8 billion, while spreads continued to gap out across the broad ABS market, according to data from  JP Morgan.

Credit card ABS spreads widened by about 3 to 10 basis points in triple-A tranches and by 25 to 45 basis points on single-A and triple-B tranches,  JP Morgan reported. Auto ABS spreads were 10 to 20 basis points wider as auto loan ABS delinquencies continued to rise.   

"We expect the credit deterioration to continue and maintain our underweight of consumer asset ABS,"  JP Morgan said in a report.   

The ABX indexes, however, posted modest gains last week, bolstered by President George W. Bush's announcement on Thursday of a plan to help homeowners facing steep increases in their mortgage payments.   

"We expect this plan to be a modest positive in softening the coming wave of (mortgage) payment shock,"  Credit Suisse said in a report on Friday. The plan will simplify paper work for qualified borrowers, though it will miss some needy home owners and allow loan modifications for others who do not need them,  Credit Suisse said.   

"However, as a grand compromise, this achieves a nice balance among all participants," the bank said.   

The ABS market could take its next cues from a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on Tuesday, one trader said.   

The Fed "certainly has the potential to change things significantly, depending on how they choose to leave the language in the policy text," the trader said.   

Top Fed policy-makers have signaled another interest rate cut on Tuesday, but the market will be pouring over their policy statement for assurances that central bankers will do more if needed. (Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

 HDUS TREASURY OUTLOOK-Hopes for early holiday rate cut cheer      BYBy Richard Leong      WC489 words   PD10 December 2007   ET22:42   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Investors are hoping for an early Christmas cheer on Tuesday if the Federal Reserve delivers a dovish message of trimming interest rates into 2008 to forestall a recession.   

If the Fed turns out to be a grinch and withhold a widely expected rate cut on perceived inflation risks, stocks are vulnerable to a heavy sell-off, and US Treasuries may see a renewed safehaven bid, analysts said on Monday.   
   TDA growing chorus of market players is clamoring for aggressive monetary policy easing from Fed, as the persistent housing slump and credit squeeze have elevated the risks that the U.S. economy could contract in the first half of 2008.   

On Monday,  Morgan Stanley became the first major Wall Street firm to call for a U.S. recession, albeit a brief, shallow one, next year. See [ID:nN10414033]   

"The economy has simply no shock absorbers left at this time. The only hope -- and it is a slim one -- is that further rate cuts might lift confidence levels with consumers, investors and CEOs enough to foster a new round of spending and investing," said Bernard Baumohl, managing director at The Economic Outlook Group LLC in Princeton Junction, New Jersey.   

At the moment, Wall Street widely expects the Fed would trim the federal funds rate by at least a quarter percentage point from the current 4.50 percent on Tuesday, based on interest rate futures.   

Some analysts forecast that the Fed could cut the discount rate, or what it charges on direct loans to banks, by half a percentage point.   

In addition to rate cuts, investors and economists expect the Federal Open Market Committee to acknowledge the downside risk to the economy rooted in the subprime mortgage market.   

In hindsight, the FOMC's policy statement back in October may have been "overzealous" in its assessment of the U.S. economy, said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for taxable money markets at Federated Investors at the Reuters Investment Outlook 2008 Summit in New York. [ID:nN10415663]   

Cunningham anticipated that the Fed's rate-setting group will likely adopt less sanguine tone in its policy statement given the renewed credit squeeze and more news of subprime-related write-downs at banks and financial companies.   

However, a government plan to help struggling home owners, together with an in-line November payroll report, has triggered an unwinding of recent safehaven trades and a rebound in the stock market.   

On Monday, the benchmark 10-year note <US10YT=RR> fell for a fifth straight session, pushing its yield to 4.15 percent, its highest since mid-November.   

In the meantime, the stock market rallied for the third time in the four sessions with blue-chip indexes gaining 0.75 percent on Monday.

 HDInvestors pare bullish bond bets before Fed - poll      WC436 words   PD11 December 2007   ET16:22   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Investors pared bullish bets on Treasuries ahead of a widely expected move by the Federal Reserve to lower the key U.S. target interest rate at least a quarter percentage point, a survey released on Tuesday shows.   

 Investors polled on Monday who said they were "long" Treasuries, or holding more U.S. government securities than their portfolio benchmarks, dropped to 11 percent from 18 percent a week ago, J.P. Morgan Securities said.   
   TD The share of long investors is at its lowest since early April following a Treasury sell-off sparked by a robust March government jobs report that showed a 175,000 gain in payrolls.   

 Eight months later, job creation shows signs of fatigue as worries about a recession have intensified on deterioration in the housing and credit sectors.   

 This bleak outlook had led investors to favor Treasuries over stocks and other risky assets. But safe-haven bids for bonds faded last week on hopes that a recession could be averted by a series of rate cuts from the Fed and a government plan to aid home owners with problem mortgages.   

 The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and is expected to release its rate decision as well as a policy statement at about 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT). The Fed's target rate on federal funds is currently 4.50 percent.   

 On Monday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> finished at 4.16 percent, its highest since mid-November.   

 While the share of longs in the survey fell sharply, the number of "neutrals," or investors who hold Treasuries equal to their portfolio benchmarks, rose to 64 percent from 56 percent last week,  J.P. Morgan said.   

 Those who said they were "short" or holding less Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, dipped to 25 percent from 26 percent the prior week, it said.   

 Among the survey's active clients, including market makers and hedge funds, none said they were "long" Treasuries, which has not happened since the week of Feb. 12. A week ago, 4 percent of active Treasury customers said they were long.   

 On the other hand, the number of active "neutral" clients rose to 9 percent from 6 percent last week, while the share of active "short" clients edged up to 6 percent from 5 a week earlier,  J.P. Morgan said.  (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by James Dalgleish)

 HDUPDATE 4-Toronto stocks dive in "kneejerk" over Fed cuts      BYBy Wojtek Dabrowski      WC633 words   PD11 December 2007   ET20:58   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds comments, details)   

TORONTO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The Toronto Stock Exchange's main index plunged more than 200 points on Tuesday as investors who expected an aggressive U.S. interest rate cut were disappointed by a more modest move and instability fears continued to weigh on the market.   
   TDThe S&P/TSX composite index was down 216.65 points, or 1.55 percent, to close at 13,723.71.   

The drop wiped out gains seen earlier in the session and came after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its key fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent.   

The U.S. central bank also reduced the discount rate it charges banks for direct loans by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent.   

While most economists and many investors anticipated a quarter-point rate cut, some had called for a bolder reduction by the Fed of 50 basis points as the U.S. copes with tight credit markets and a protracted housing slump.   

However, those calling for a bigger cut were seen as being in the minority and the selloff took some observers off guard.   

"I'm just very surprised we're getting such a negative reaction," said Glenn MacNeill, vice-president of investments at Sentry Select Capital Corp.   

"We've seen pretty rocky markets as fear seems to be dominating the package here," he said, adding he viewed the rate cut as "good news."   

The S&P/TSX 60 index of Canadian bluechips fell 15.08 points, or 1.85 percent, to 798.95.   

The selloff in the resource-laden Toronto market was exacerbated by a sharp drop in the price of gold which also came in wake of the Fed move.   

Nine of the TSX's 10 main subgroups moved lower, including the materials group which dove 2.92 percent. Energy issues fell 1.62 percent and financials, sensitive to rate moves, gave up 1.15 percent.   

A pair of mining companies were the session's two biggest net losers: First Quantum Minerals took the top spot, shedding C$4.67, or 4.8 percent, to C$92.70. Inmet Mining was second, falling C$4.13, or 4.6 percent, to C$84.98.   

The nosedive that came in wake of the Fed rate announcement could have been caused by what the central bank chose to do regarding discount rates, suggested Neil Andrew, portfolio manager at Leeward Hedge Funds in Toronto.   

"The fed funds rate was one thing -- everyone expected that quarter point -- but on the discount rate, people wanted the 50 (basis points)," he said.   

He called the market's reaction to the news a "kneejerk" pullback and predicted it might not be long before buying resumes again.   

"Given the extent of the selloff this afternoon, it certainly wouldn't surprise us if people started nibbling away again starting tomorrow," he said.   

BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd also joined the losers' row on Tuesday, with its volatile shares giving up C$3.94, or 3.8 percent, to C$99.32.   

Lululemon Athletica , which makes trendy yoga wear, bucked the downward pull of the market, adding C$3.90, or 8.9 percent, to finish at C$47.85.   

South of the border, the rout was just as pronounced, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 294.26 points, or 2.14 percent, to close out the session at 13,432.77. The Nasdaq composite sagged 66.60 points, or 2.45 percent, to 2,652.35.

 HDJGBs surge on Treasuries after Fed, more cuts seen      BYBy Masayuki Kitano      WC674 words   PD12 December 2007   ET02:17   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPTOKYO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds jumped on Wednesday, boosted by a surge in U.S. Treasuries on the view that the Federal Reserve's 25 basis point interest rate cut may not be enough to stem the impact of credit problems on the U.S. economy.   

Treasuries posted their biggest rally in more than three years on Tuesday as investors dumped U.S. stocks for safer government debt after the cut in the fed funds rate to 4.25 percent surprised some investors who had been hoping for a 50 basis point cut.   
   TDA Reuters poll taken after the Fed's announcement shows that 15 out of 18 U.S. primary dealers see the central bank cutting rates next month. [nNAT003508]   

Such expectations for further Fed rate cuts helped reinforced the market's view that the Bank of Japan likely won't raise rates until the latter half of next year, market players said.   

"In order for the BOJ to be able to raise interest rates by the end of the fiscal year, I think there needs to be a sense that there won't be any more rate cuts in the United States," said Mari Iwashita, senior strategist for Daiwa Securities SMBC.   

"But that isn't the case, and a BOJ rate rise by the end of the fiscal year seems very difficult," Iwashita said. Japan's current fiscal year lasts until the end of March.   

March 10-year JGB futures rose by as much as 0.87 point to 136.81 <2JGBv1>, rebounding sharply from a one-month low for a lead contract of 135.94 hit on Tuesday.   

The March contract, which took over as the lead contract on Tuesday, finished the day at 136.65 for a gain of 0.71 point, creeping back towards a 22-month lead contract high of 137.73 hit earlier in the month.   

The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB <JP10YTN=JBTC> tumbled as much as eight basis points to 1.500 percent, peeling away from a one-month high of 1.585 percent hit on Tuesday.   

The 10-year yield later inched up from the day's lows and stood at 1.515 percent for a decline of 6.5 basis points on the day.   

Short- to mid-term maturities also rallied. The five-year yield <JP5YTN=JBTC> dropped as much as seven basis points to 1.030 percent, while the two-year yield <JP2YTN=JBTC> fell by as much as four basis points to 0.695 percent, its lowest since October 2006.   

The Fed's decision follows renewed deterioration in credit markets after major financial institutions around the world have reported billions of dollars' worth of write-downs due to extensive exposure to delinquent mortgages.   

Swap contracts on the overnight call rate <JPONIBOJ=TRDT> show the market is pricing in only a 10 percent chance of the BOJ raising interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent by March, while such chances rise to around 50 percent by September.   

Analysts said that gains in Treasuries on the Fed cut may have been overdone, but ongoing concerns about whether the U.S. economy will be able to buck liquidity problems would keep bond markets supported, and that JGBs may extend Wednesday's climb.   

"Increasingly, investors are becoming more pessimistic on the economy," said Freddy Lim, JGB strategist at  Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, adding that investors remain worried about growth in Japanese exports, along with consumption and wages.

 HDJGBs surge on Treasuries after Fed, more cuts seen      BYBy Masayuki Kitano      WC655 words   PD12 December 2007   ET02:17   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPTOKYO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds jumped on Wednesday, boosted by a surge in U.S. Treasuries on the view that the Federal Reserve's 25 basis point interest rate cut may not be enough to stem the impact of credit problems on the U.S. economy.   

Treasuries posted their biggest rally in more than three years on Tuesday as investors dumped U.S. stocks for safer government debt after the cut in the fed funds rate to 4.25 percent surprised some investors who had been hoping for a 50 basis point cut.   
   TDA Reuters poll taken after the Fed's announcement shows that 15 out of 18 U.S. primary dealers see the central bank cutting rates next month.   

Such expectations for further Fed rate cuts helped reinforced the market's view that the Bank of Japan likely won't raise rates until the latter half of next year, market players said.   

"In order for the BOJ to be able to raise interest rates by the end of the fiscal year, I think there needs to be a sense that there won't be any more rate cuts in the United States," said Mari Iwashita, senior strategist for Daiwa Securities SMBC.   

"But that isn't the case, and a BOJ rate rise by the end of the fiscal year seems very difficult," Iwashita said. Japan's current fiscal year lasts until the end of March.   

March 10-year JGB futures rose by as much as 0.87 point to 136.81 rebounding sharply from a one-month low for a lead contract of 135.94 hit on Tuesday.   

The March contract, which took over as the lead contract on Tuesday, finished the day at 136.65 for a gain of 0.71 point, creeping back towards a 22-month lead contract high of 137.73 hit earlier in the month.   

The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB tumbled as much as eight basis points to 1.500 percent, peeling away from a one-month high of 1.585 percent hit on Tuesday.   

The 10-year yield later inched up from the day's lows and stood at 1.515 percent for a decline of 6.5 basis points on the day.   

Short- to mid-term maturities also rallied. The five-year yield dropped as much as seven basis points to 1.030 percent, while the two-year yield fell by as much as four basis points to 0.695 percent, its lowest since October 2006.   

The Fed's decision follows renewed deterioration in credit markets after major financial institutions around the world have reported billions of dollars' worth of write-downs due to extensive exposure to delinquent mortgages.   

Swap contracts on the overnight call rate show the market is pricing in only a 10 percent chance of the BOJ raising interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent by March, while such chances rise to around 50 percent by September.   

Analysts said that gains in Treasuries on the Fed cut may have been overdone, but ongoing concerns about whether the U.S. economy will be able to buck liquidity problems would keep bond markets supported, and that JGBs may extend Wednesday's climb.   

"Increasingly, investors are becoming more pessimistic on the economy," said Freddy Lim, JGB strategist at  Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, adding that investors remain worried about growth in Japanese exports, along with consumption and wages.   

"So I think it's more of a bullish market for JGBs," he said, adding that the 10-year yield may soon fall to 1.45 percent, particularly if the BOJ's tankan survey of business sentiment due on Friday shows that firms are less optimistic about the economy.

 HDJGBs rally on U.S. Treasuries after Fed, more cuts seen      BYBy Naomi Tajitsu      WC783 words   PD12 December 2007   ET02:17   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited

Treasuries posted their biggest rally in more than three years on Tuesday as investors dumped U.S. stocks for safer government debt after the cut in the fed funds rate to 4.25 percent surprised some investors who had been hoping for a 50 basis point cut.   
   TD"JGBs are up because Treasuries rose on the view that the Fed's move leaves the door open for more rate cuts in the future," said Naomi Hasegawa, senior JGB strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.   

"Also, U.S. stocks fell, so what we had was a 'sell-the-fact' situation in equities," she said, adding that many in the market had been anticipating only a 25 basis point rate cut.

Investors offered limited reaction to data showing that Japan's corporate goods price index rose 2.3 percent in November from a year ago, its fastest pace in more than a year, as it did little to change the market's view that Japanese interest rates are unlikely to rise until later next year.   

March futures <2JGBc1> jumped as much as 0.84 point to the day's high of 136.78 at the open, reversing a fall to a one-month low on Tuesday. Futures had hit a 22-month high of 137.73 earlier in the month.   

The March contract, which took over as the lead contract on Tuesday, ended the morning up 0.79 point at 136.73, also boosted by a 1.84 percent fall in the Nikkei stocks average <.N225>.   

The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB <JP10YTN=JBTC> tumbled as much as six basis points to 1.520 percent, peeling away from a one-month high of 1.585 percent hit on Tuesday.   

Short- to mid-term maturities also rallied. The five-year yield <JP5YTN=JBTC> dropped as much as seven basis points to 1.030 percent, while the two-year yield <JP2YTN=JBTC> fell four basis points to 0.695 percent, its lowest since October 2006.   

Analysts said that gains in Treasuries on the Fed cut may have been overdone, but ongoing concerns about whether the U.S. economy will be able to buck liquidity problems would keep bond markets supported, and that JGBs may extend Wednesday's climb.   

"Increasingly, investors are becoming more pessimistic on the economy," said Freddy Lim, JGB strategist at  Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, adding that investors remain worried about growth in Japanese exports, along with consumption and wages.   

"So I think it's more of a bullish market for JGBs," he said, adding that the 10-year yield may soon fall to 1.45 percent, particularly if the BOJ's tankan survey of business sentiment due on Friday shows that firms are less optimistic about the economy.   

But he added that, barring any fresh factors to pick up bonds, the 10-year yield was unlikely to revisit a 26-month low of 1.395 percent hit last month.   

Explaining the rate cut, the Fed said financial strains had increased in recent weeks but some inflation risks remained. Some investors had been expecting the Fed to put more emphasis on concerns about weakening economic growth.   

The Fed's decision follows renewed deterioration in credit markets after major financial institutions around the world have reported billions of dollars' worth of write-downs due to extensive exposure to delinquent mortgages.   

Tuesday's cut marked the third time the Fed has lowered the fed funds rate since September, taking it down from 5.25 percent. Analysts say the Bank of Japan will have a difficult time raising interest rates while the Fed remains on its cutting campaign.   

Market participants say that the Fed's move on Tuesday did little to change the view that Japanese interest rates will not rise until well into next year.   

Swap contracts on the overnight call rate <JPONIBOJ=TRDT> show the market is pricing in only a 10 percent chance of a lift in rates from 0.5 percent by March, while such chances rise to around 50 percent by September.

NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. interest rate swap spreads narrowed sharply on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve and other central banks announced a plan aimed at boosting liquidity in the global money markets.   
   TDThe surprise plan came less than 24 hours after a massive stock sell-off and Treasuries rally when traders were disappointed by the Fed's modest quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds target rate.   

The risk premium on the two-year swap over Treasuries jumped to a record high on Tuesday, reflecting the race into cash and low-risk assets among risk-averse investors.   

Under the plan announced on Wednesday, the Fed would auction short-term funds to banks against a wide variety of collateral that can be used to obtain direct loans from the Fed. The first auction will be $20 billion in 28-day term funds on Monday, with several more sales set in the coming weeks. For details, see [ID:nN12401860].   

All markets reacted swiftly to the central banks' coordinated move. Stocks opened 2 percent higher and bonds fell sharply, reversing Tuesday's moves.   

Perhaps more importantly, short-term dollar deposit rates fell to about 4.79 percent from about 5.10 percent before.   

There is skepticism over the latest attempt by central banks to revive an ailing credit market hobbled by U.S. subprime mortgage fallout. This could lead to gyrations in risk appetite and risk premiums into the year-end, analysts said.   

"From a risk-return perspective ... swap spread trades do not appear attractive for the time being," said Fidelio Tata, head of derivatives strategy at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. "It is reasonable to assume that market participants continue to prefer Treasuries over spread products in the weeks to come, causing swap spreads to remain elevated until after year-end."   

The two-year swap spread last traded at 91.25 basis points compared with 88.75 basis points earlier and 106.25 basis points late on Tuesday, a record wide level.   

Longer swap spreads moved less dramatically. The 10-year spread last traded at 69.50 basis points compared with 67.75 basis points earlier and 74.00 basis points late on Tuesday.

 HDRPT-GLOBAL ECONOMY WEEKAHEAD-Inflation keeps heat on cent. banks      BYBy Emily Kaiser      WC743 words   PD10 December 2007   ET10:40   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(This is a repeat of an item that originally ran at 2300 GMT)   

WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Another U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut this week is a foregone conclusion as far as financial markets are concerned, but a heaping helping of global inflation data may leave a sour aftertaste.   
   TDThe Fed is widely expected to follow the central banks of Canada and England with a quarter-percentage-point reduction in the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday and some economists predict a more aggressive half-point cut to prevent a housing downturn and credit contraction from derailing the economy.   

But nagging inflation, largely from steep energy and food prices, is forcing central bankers onto a narrow plank as they seek the right balance between promoting growth and keeping prices in check. Inflation hawks will likely be heard at least faintly in the closely watched statement announcing the Fed's decision.   

Last week, the European Central Bank kept rates on hold but acknowledged that some members had considered a hike to tamp down rising prices. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the euro zone central bank "stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability," which sent a signal to investors that rate cuts were unlikely any time soon.   

The Fed will probably take a softer tone, leaving the door open to lowering borrowing costs further early next year, amid expectations that a slowing economy will ease price pressure in other key areas such as wages.   

However, recent data hasn't been going the Fed's way. A report on the U.S. labor market's health on Friday showed wages rose by a surprisingly large 0.5 percent in November.   

PPI A 'SHOCKER'   

Higher-than-expected readings on the U.S. producer and consumer price indexes, due on Thursday and Friday, may prompt some second-guessing, particularly if the Fed does opt for the more aggressive half-point cut. For details on major global economic data due out this week, click on [ID:nL07400930]).   

Global Insight expects a hefty 2.5 percent rise in the PPI, which would be the fourth-largest jump since the index began in 1947. But the "core" rate, stripping out food and energy costs, should remain relatively tame.   

"While the top-level number will be a shocker, we do not expect the moderate rise in the core rate to cause Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to fall out of bed at night," Global Insight's economists wrote in a note to clients.   

Exporting powerhouse China's consumer price index is also expected this week, and will likely show inflation moderated only slightly from an 11-year high notched in October. Many economists, including former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, think China's deflationary power is petering out, and rising domestic prices will filter through into its exports.   

To be sure, the U.S. dollar has shown signs of stabilizing, and oil has dipped below $90 per barrel, giving inflation-watchers some breathing room. However, with OPEC declining to boost output and with crop prices still high, food and energy costs are likely to remain elevated for some time.   

Perhaps more worrisome, there are signs that U.S. consumers' inflation expectations may be coming unstuck, another threat to already sluggish spending growth.   

The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, released on Friday, found that one-year inflation expectations edged up to 3.5 percent in December, the highest reading since August 2006. Five-year expectations also rose.   

"The outlook for growth is quite dire at the same time inflation expectations are rising," said T.J. Marta, fixed income strategist at  RBC Capital Markets in New York, adding that the Fed would no doubt cut rates now to avoid a recession, but may be hiking rates again by the end of next year.

 HDUPDATE 1-Fed hopes ease dollar interbank lending stress      BYBy Natsuko Waki      WC654 words   PD10 December 2007   ET12:57   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds quotes, background)   

LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Interbank lending rates for the dollar covering the New Year period fell for a fourth day on Monday as an expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut this week looked set to ease pressure in the money markets.   
   TDIn contrast, funding costs for one-month euro rose again to fresh 7-year peaks as the European Central Bank kept a firm focus on upside inflation risks.   

The premium for sterling cash also rose as speculation grew that the Bank of England was unlikely to implement further liquidity measures after it lowered the cost of borrowing last week.   

The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points from the current 4.5 percent.   

Some analysts expect the central bank to cut the discount rate -- at which banks borrow from the Fed -- by a bigger 50 bps or even 75 bps to help relieve money market pressures.   

"The Fed needs to do something to get term rates lower. We are pretty much guaranteed to get a 25 bps cut but the market is hoping for a bigger cut in the discount window," said Adam Myers, market strategist at  Credit Suisse.

"People don't want to go to the discount window now because there is a stigma attached. But a bigger cut in the discount window will change it because it would make a business case (for banks to borrow)."   

Lower benchmark interest rates would make it easier for banks to access funds in the interbank money market after the credit crisis since August effectively shut key funding channels for banks, including the asset backed commercial paper market.   

Even lower discount rates would encourage banks to borrow more and shore up balance sheets, without fanning investor suspicion about possible problems they might have.   

London interbank offered rates for one-month dollar fell to 5.23188 percent <LIBOR>. One-month euro rates -- which have shown particular stress in recent sessions -- rose to 4.89625 percent, their highest since December 2000.   

After leaving the cost of borrowing on hold last week, some ECB policymakers on Monday highlighted upside inflation risks.   

"In the euro zone, funding costs are even more painful (than in the U.S.), as higher prints of headline inflation in recent months, coupled with the sticky growth in money supply have prevented the credit turmoil from repricing lower future ECB rates,"  Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.   

Investors expect the ECB to leave interest rates on hold throughout next year. Comparing three-month rates, interbank rates stand 87 basis points above expected policy rates.   

"The steep rise in credit spreads were mapped to outright tightening of funding conditions to the private sector. (Interbank rates are) effectively reflecting almost 3 'hikes' relative to the current ECB rate," Goldman said.   

ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the credit squeeze could yet turn into a full-blown crunch and the bank would intervene in money markets if needed to ensure no shortage of overnight funds for banks at the turn of the year.   

RELIEF OVER IN UK?   

The fall in sterling interbank lending rates after last week's BoE rate cut proved short-lived as one-month sterling rates rose to 6.69500 percent.   

"Interbank money markets sterling seized up more in sterling than dollars in the last 24 hours and the reason for that is because they are not expecting the BoE to provide the similar level of policy accommodation (to the Fed)," Myers said.   

The Bank for International Settlements said in its quarterly report that international bank lending growth was slowing sharply already in the second quarter, just before the credit crunch started in earnest. (Reporting by Natsuko Waki; editing by Tony Austin)

 HDGLOBAL ECONOMY WEEKAHEAD-Inflation keeps heat on central banks      BYBy Emily Kaiser      WC734 words   PD10 December 2007   ET14:00   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Repeats to additional subscribers)   

WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Another U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut this week is a foregone conclusion as far as financial markets are concerned, but a heaping helping of global inflation data may leave a sour aftertaste.   
   TDThe Fed is widely expected to follow the central banks of Canada and England with a quarter-percentage-point reduction in the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday and some economists predict a more aggressive half-point cut to prevent a housing downturn and credit contraction from derailing the economy.   

But nagging inflation, largely from steep energy and food prices, is forcing central bankers onto a narrow plank as they seek the right balance between promoting growth and keeping prices in check. Inflation hawks will likely be heard at least faintly in the closely watched statement announcing the Fed's decision.   

Last week, the European Central Bank kept rates on hold but acknowledged that some members had considered a hike to tamp down rising prices. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the euro zone central bank "stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability," which sent a signal to investors that rate cuts were unlikely any time soon.   

The Fed will probably take a softer tone, leaving the door open to lowering borrowing costs further early next year, amid expectations that a slowing economy will ease price pressure in other key areas such as wages.   

However, recent data hasn't been going the Fed's way. A report on the U.S. labor market's health on Friday showed wages rose by a surprisingly large 0.5 percent in November.   

PPI A 'SHOCKER'   

Higher-than-expected readings on the U.S. producer and consumer price indexes, due on Thursday and Friday, may prompt some second-guessing, particularly if the Fed does opt for the more aggressive half-point cut. For details on major global economic data due out this week, click on [ID:nL07400930]).   

Global Insight expects a hefty 2.5 percent rise in the PPI, which would be the fourth-largest jump since the index began in 1947. But the "core" rate, stripping out food and energy costs, should remain relatively tame.   

"While the top-level number will be a shocker, we do not expect the moderate rise in the core rate to cause Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to fall out of bed at night," Global Insight's economists wrote in a note to clients.   

Exporting powerhouse China's consumer price index is also expected this week, and will likely show inflation moderated only slightly from an 11-year high notched in October. Many economists, including former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, think China's deflationary power is petering out, and rising domestic prices will filter through into its exports.   

To be sure, the U.S. dollar has shown signs of stabilizing, and oil has dipped below $90 per barrel, giving inflation-watchers some breathing room. However, with OPEC declining to boost output and with crop prices still high, food and energy costs are likely to remain elevated for some time.   

Perhaps more worrisome, there are signs that U.S. consumers' inflation expectations may be coming unstuck, another threat to already sluggish spending growth.   

The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, released on Friday, found that one-year inflation expectations edged up to 3.5 percent in December, the highest reading since August 2006. Five-year expectations also rose.   

"The outlook for growth is quite dire at the same time inflation expectations are rising," said T.J. Marta, fixed income strategist at  RBC Capital Markets in New York, adding that the Fed would no doubt cut rates now to avoid a recession, but may be hiking rates again by the end of next year.   

The Economic Cycle Research Institute's U.S. Future Inflation Gauge, designed to anticipate cyclical swings in the rate of inflation, rose to 119.7 in November from an upwardly revised 119.0 in October.   

For now, risks to growth appear to outweigh inflationary pressures, but if next week's data show prices rose more than expected, central bankers may be feeling more heat. (Editing by James Dalgleish)

 HDUPDATE 1-BoE offers 3-mth cash in joint c.bank action      WC478 words   PD12 December 2007   ET15:19   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will offer three-month loans against a wider range of collateral on Dec. 18 and Jan. 15 as part of coordinated action by leading central banks to boost confidence in fragile money markets, the BoE said on Wednesday.   
   TDIn a statement timed to go out with similar announcements from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the  Swiss National Bank and the  Bank of Canada, the BoE said the aim was to "address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets".   

Interbank lending has all but dried up before the end of the year. Financial institutions are reluctant to do business with one another for fear of what losses arising from U.S. sub-prime mortgage lending lie on each others' books.   

One-month sterling LIBOR rates were this week trading nearly 125 basis points above the BoE's main lending rate.   

"This coordinated set of actions is in response to pressures in interbank markets which have increased in recent weeks reflecting sentiment about the global financial sector," said a BoE spokesman.   

"These actions demonstrate that central banks are working together to try to forestall any prospective sharp tightening in in credit conditions."   

Stock markets across the world rallied and bond prices came down after the coordinated attack on the funding squeeze.   

"This is giving positive help exactly where it's needed," said Russell Silberston, head of interest rate strategy at  Investec Asset Management. "It's good news."   

Central bank sources said the issue at stake was tackling confidence, not liquidity as the actual amounts of cash on offer were in the greater scheme of things not so large.   

The BoE said the total size of reserves offered in its December and January operations will be raised to 11.35 billion pounds from 2.85 billion, of which 10 billion pounds will offered at a 3-month maturity. This will be offset against other operations, however.   

It will also accept a much broader variety of collateral such as AAA-rated tranches of UK and European Economic Area (EEA) prime residential mortgage-backed securities and covered bonds rated AAA, although this is not quite as wide a range as it offered to take in September. The EEA comprises EU members and some other European countries.   

"There will be no further changes to the scheduled operations on 18 December and 15 January," the BoE said. "The Bank will review whether to make any changes to operations scheduled after January in the light of market conditions at the time."

 HDANALYSIS-Central bankers take high-stakes economic gamble      BYBy Emily Kaiser      WC796 words   PD12 December 2007   ET20:28   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Central banks have gambled big on whether they can solve the credit crisis by clubbing together to revive bank lending.   

If their efforts to boost liquidity succeed, the financial market upheaval can be relegated to history as a painful but brief episode. If they fail, the U.S. economy looks headed for recession, dragging much of the world down with it.   
   TD"This medicine was designed specifically to go after the economy's core ailment, which is the growing scarcity of lending capital by banks," Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a note to clients.   

"What this coordinated central bank action has done is reduce the (chances) of a recession from 65 percent to 50 percent in the U.S.," he said.. "A lot more still needs to be done to keep the economy out of any real trouble, both in terms of further interest rate cuts and even more creative strategies to facilitate bank lending. We're not out of the woods yet."   

By teaming up on Wednesday to announce efforts to ease financial market strain, the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank,  Swiss National Bank,  Bank of Canada and Bank of England sent a clear signal to investors that they grasped the magnitude of the credit market distress and were prepared to act. (For details on the central banks' actions, click on [ID:nL02263609])   

It will not be a quick fix, however, as banks need time to rebuild battered balance sheets and regain confidence in sound lending practices. And it may be too little, too late to undo the damage already done to the world economy.   

MILD OR SEVERE DOWNTURN?   

There is little doubt that global economic growth will slow next year, dragged down primarily by weakness in the United States. The International Monetary Fund cut its 2008 global growth forecast to 4.8 percent from 5.2 percent in October, and is expected to trim it further next month.   

But whether the downturn is mild or severe depends almost entirely on how the credit crisis plays out beyond the financial markets.   

Economists have long warned that easy credit terms were leading to asset bubbles, and many saw tightening credit conditions as a welcome development after years of excess. The concern is that panicky banks have now overcorrected, curbing credit to worthy borrowers and stifling economic growth.   

Banks have taken a $50 billion hit from bad loans, primarily tied to the U.S. subprime mortgage market, and analysts expect billions more in losses.   

That leaves less money for companies wanting to build new factories, or consumers hoping to remodel their homes, hurting economic growth. That is why central bankers are eager to restore confidence among lenders to get money flowing again.   

"The main problem in credit markets has not been that (interest) rates are too high, but that financial institutions have been unwilling to lend," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones. "This added liquidity should relieve some of that pressure."   

The Fed's most recent survey of senior loan officers found credit terms tightening well beyond the housing market. About one-fifth of domestic banks surveyed said they tightened lending standards for commercial and industrial borrowers. One fourth of domestic banks reported tighter credit standards for consumer loans other than credit cards.   

Conditions looked somewhat better in Europe. ECB Vice President Lucas Papademos said there had been only limited spillover so far from tensions on the euro money market -- where banks get funding -- over to the interest rates that they charge businesses and consumers.   

"Neither the price of credit extended to the private sector nor the quantity of credit extended to the private sector has changed much," he said on Wednesday.   

But credit markets have clearly been feeling the strain as wary banks hoard cash. The spread between the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and the Fed's key overnight lending rate remained abnormally wide, a sign that banks were holding back.   

Many economists said the actions announced on Wednesday were aimed at addressing that Libor anomaly.   

"It is likely to take months before spreads begin to narrow again, and will only happen once institutions begin to trust each other once more. And this will only happen when the frequency of write-downs begins to diminish," Commerzbank analyst Peter Dixon wrote in a note to clients. "That said, if we get through December without a major liquidity squeeze, the world is likely to look a brighter place come early January." (Editing by Frank McGurty)

 HDRPT-FOREX-Dollar holds near one-month high vs yen before Fed      BYBy Chikako Mogi      WC698 words   PD11 December 2007   ET07:48   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPTOKYO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a one-month high against the yen on Tuesday as expectations for an aggressive interest rate cut later in the day by the Federal Reserve waned following solid U.S. economic data.   

The Fed is widely seen cutting overnight rates by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent and stating its commitment to pumping funds into the strained banking system towards the end of the year.   
   TDData released in the last few sessions, including an as-expected increase in employment and surprising rise in pending home sales, eased some fears of an imminent U.S. recession.   

Investor risk appetite also improved on news that financial institutions, battered by their exposure to subprime mortgage defaults, were getting capital from investors in Asia and the Middle East.   

Traders said the dollar's gains against the yen are seen limited as many in the market believe the Fed may have to trim interest rates more to calm credit markets completely even after Tuesday's expected rate cut.   

"If the Fed slashes rates by a quarter-percentage point, it would boost expectations that the central banks will drift into a succession of monetary policy easing," says Yasutoshi Nagai, senior economist at Daiwa Securities SMBC. "That would spark selling in equities as well as in the dollar," Nagai said.   

Nagai, who expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a half percentage point on Tuesday, said an aggressive rate move would boost share prices and the dollar against the yen as it would show how committed the central bank is to tackling the credit problems. Traders said the dollar was likely to hold steady before the Fed decision, as the recovery in risk appetite was likely to benefit high-yielding currencies such as the euro, Australian dollar and sterling at the expense of the low-yielding yen.   

The dollar was up 0.1 percent to 111.75 yen after rising to a one-month high around 111.95 yen, moving further away from a 2-1/2-year low of 107.22 yen hit last month.   

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.4725 rising from a three-week low of $1.4525 hit last week after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet appeared to leave open the possibility of higher interest rates next year.   

The euro was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 164.60 yen.   

The Australian dollar was up 0.4 percent against the yen at 99.19 while the New Zealand dollar was up 0.3 percent against the Japanese unit to 87.42   

Traders continued to keep an eye on U.S. data including retail sales and quarterly earnings reports from big U.S. investment banks for clues on the damage from the credit crunch.   

The dollar dipped on Monday after Swiss bank UBS announced $10 billion in subprime write-downs and said it had obtained a capital injection from a Singapore government entity and an unnamed Middle East investor.   

"The dollar may be steady against the yen thanks to cross/yen buying, but its general trend remains downward as players eye yield differences," said a senior dealer at an European bank.   

"The Bank of England cut interest rates but they are still high, while there remains the risk of interest rates rising in the euro zone, undermining the dollar," he said.   

Last week, the BoE cut interest rates by a quarter point to 5.5 percent while the ECB kept rates unchanged at 4 percent.   

Mitsuru Yaguchi, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, said the euro zone economy will likely feel the impact of a U.S. growth slowdown next year, keeping the ECB from raising interest rates at least until late in 2008.   

"In the next three months, downside risks to the euro zone economy may appear to grow, but I think the ECB will keep rates steady and not lower them through 2008, keeping the euro in tight ranges," Yaguchi said. (Additional Reporting by Rika Otsuka; Editing by Hugh Lawson)

 HDUPDATE 7-Gold drops below $800 after Fed cuts rate      BYBy Frank Tang      WC632 words   PD11 December 2007   ET12:03   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Recasts, updates with closing prices, market activity, changes dateline pvs LONDON)   

NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Gold dropped sharply by afternoon in New York on Tuesday, as bullion investors were disappointed after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by only a quarter of a percentage point   
   TDAt 3:44 p.m. EST (2044 GMT), spot gold <XAU=> traded at $798.70/799.50 per troy ounce, sharply down from $808.00/808.70 in New York late on Monday, when it gained more than 1 percent.   

The Fed cut benchmark U.S. interest rates by a modest 25 basis points to help the U.S. economy withstand tightened credit and a prolonged housing slump. This disappointed financial markets, which had hoped for more aggressive action.   

"Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation," the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement outlining its decision.   

The central bank's decision takes the bellwether federal funds rate, which governs overnight lending between banks, down to 4.25 percent. While the action was widely expected, some bullion market watchers had thought the Fed might offer a bolder half-point reduction in the rate. U.S. stocks also tumbled following the news.   

An interest rate cut lowers the cost of borrowing and makes bullion more attractive compared with fixed-income investments.   

Before the Fed announcement, rising energy prices boosted gold futures to a higher finish in Tuesday's open-outcry session. U.S. crude futures <CLc1> were up nearly $2 at just below $90 a barrel in afternoon trade.   

Most-active February gold <GCG8> on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange settled up $3.60 at $817.10 an ounce prior to the Fed rate-cut announcement.   

"The longer-term implications of falling U.S. interest rates will draw investors away from U.S. treasuries and towards better performing assets such as gold," said analyst James Moore of TheBullionDesk.com.   

INVESTMENT DEMAND JUMPS   

Wider investment interest in gold was robust, analysts said, with the largest gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) witnessing big inflows on Monday.   

Gold held in New York-listed  StreetTRACKS Gold Shares <XAUEXT-NYS-TT> rose to a record high of 614.67 tonnes on Monday -- up 36 percent from the start of the year.   

In other markets, the key October 2008 gold contract <0#JAU:> on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange ended 35 yen per gram higher at 2,926 yen.   

While bullion prices have rallied in the last couple of days, spot gold is still some way off 28-year highs seen in early November at $845.40.   

UBS metals analyst John Reade said the market still had scope to correct lower, before fresh long positions were reinstated.   

"We continue to look for an opportunity to get tactically long gold again but need to see speculative positioning reduced and jewellery demand return," Reade said in a note to clients.   

In industry news, South African gold output fell 5.8 percent in volume terms in October compared with the same month the previous year, official data showed on Tuesday. [ID:nWEB0459]

 HDUS TREASURY OUTLOOK-Bond bulls to reign on stingy Fed      BYBy Richard Leong      WC460 words   PD11 December 2007   ET22:59   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Bond bulls will likely reign in the U.S. Treasuries market on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve disappointed stock investors, who had bet on a bold rate move to relieve the credit crisis and prevent a recession.   

Fed's perceived miserly quarter-point cut in the federal funds target rate to 4.25 percent unleashed selling in stocks and a safe-haven stampede into Treasuries.   
   TDSome investors were also surprised by the Fed's restrained quarter-point cut of the discount rate, the cost on Fed's direct loans to banks. They had wished for a forceful half a percentage point cut in the discount rate to lift liquidity in the credit market, which has been hobbled by the massive losses suffered by banks due to their subprime mortgage exposure.   

"A bigger discount rate cut would have helped troubled banks with problems accessing credit," said Haag Sherman, managing director at Salient Partners based in Houston.   

Stock traders' reaction to the Fed's seeming timid rate decision was severe with the Standard & Poor's 500 index <.SPX> losing 2.5 percent.   

While leaving the door open for more rate cuts, the Fed's gradualist approach upset expectations of a resolution to the credit squeeze and housing correction, analysts said.   

"There's not a lot of clarity that came out of it," said Jamie Jackson, portfolio manager at RiverSource Investments in Minneapolis said the Fed's policy statement.   

The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-setting group, in its post-meeting statement acknowledged the credit turmoil to downside growth risk, but maintained its worry about inflation. See [ID:nTRS000042]   

The FOMC is "walking a thin line between addressing the issue in credit market and spurring inflation through a more dramatic cut," Salient's Sherman said.   

Interest rate futures implied that traders are pricing in the prospects of another quarter point cut at the FOMC January meeting.   

A further stock swoon will likely breed more safe-haven bids for low-risk U.S. government debt on Wednesday in the absence of major data, investors said.   

On Tuesday, the two-year Treasury note <US2YT=RR>, most sensitive to Fed policy outlook, jumped 14/32 to 100-11/32 in price. Its yield, which moves inversely with its price, slid to 2.94 percent, down 24 basis points from late Monday.   

Longer-dated benchmark 10-year debt <US10YT=RR> soared 1-1/2 to 102-6/32 with its yield at 3.98 percent, posting its biggest one-day yield decline in three years. (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Neil Stempleman)

 HDWall Street extends advance as investors hoping for rate cut shrug off  UBS subprime writedown      BYBy MADLEN READ      CRAP Business Writer   WC890 words   PD11 December 2007   ET00:58   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Wall Street advanced Monday as expectations for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and an uptick in pending home sales helped offset concerns about another round of subprime mortgage-related losses. The Dow Jones industrials gained more than 100 points.   

Investors remained upbeat ahead of the Fed's rate-setting meeting on Tuesday. Policymakers are broadly expected to lower rates, though economists are still split over whether there will be a quarter-point cut or half-point cut.   
   TDThe National Association of Realtors gave Wall Street reason to be optimistic Monday when it said its forward-looking index of U.S. home sales rose in October for the second month in a row. Though investors still expect the housing market to remain weak well into 2008, the association is forecasting sales and prices to start recovering modestly next year.   

The downturn in housing has led to huge losses among banks that invested in securities backed by mortgages, and on Monday,  UBS revealed large writedowns. The Swiss bank said it will write down some $10 billion of subprime mortgage holdings, which could lead to full-year losses. However, its U.S. shares rose $1.10, or 2.2 percent, to $51.58 after the bank unveiled plans for an $11.5 billion cash infusion from the government of Singapore and an unidentified Middle Eastern investor.   

"The financial stocks are leading the way higher because of the  UBS news," said Donald Selkin, director of equity research at Joseph Stevens. "There is optimism today that we have seen the worst in the financial sector. There is a feeling that these stocks have already discounted the worst case scenario."   

The announcement from  UBS comes ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from the top U.S. investment banks.  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. will release results Thursday, while  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  Morgan Stanley and  Bear Stearns Cos. are scheduled to report next week.   

After the closing bell,  Washington Mutual Inc. said it will record a $1.6 billion writedown on its home loans business as it announced plans to discontinue all subprime mortgage lending and eliminate 2,600 positions in the home loans segment. The nation's largest savings and loan now expects a loss in the fourth quarter due to the writedown.   

The Dow rose 101.45, or 0.74 percent, to 13,727.03.   

Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.30, or 0.75 percent, to 1,515.96. The Nasdaq composite index added 12.79, or 0.47 percent, to 2,718.95.   

Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury note's yield, which moves opposite the price, rose to 4.16 percent from 4.12 percent late Friday.   

The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, and gold prices rose.   

Wall Street has posted robust gains recently as investors grew more confident in the Fed's openness to loosening its policy again. The Dow has risen more than 740 points over the last two weeks, a rally that has brought the blue-chip index to about 3 percent below the record close it reached Oct. 9.   

WaMu's shares shed $1.73, or 8.7 percent, to $18.15 in after-hours activity, after the stock rose 85 cents, or 4.5 percent, to close at $19.88.   

Blackstone Group LP might be planning a bid to acquire steel company  Rio Tinto Ltd., according to Britain's Daily Telegraph. Blackstone would lead a consortium that would include China's sovereign wealth fund, according to the report. Blackstone rose $1.52, or 6.9 percent, to $23.45, and  Rio Tinto rose $9.71, or 2.1 percent, to $477.71.   

McDonald's Corp., the world's largest fast-food company, said global same-store sales rose 8.2 percent in November. Much of the strength came from overseas, including Europe and Asia.  McDonald's, one of the 30 Dow components, rose $1.74, or 2.9 percent, to $61.90.   

Shares of Dow component  Caterpillar Inc. advanced after a  Bear Stearns analyst highlighted the construction and farm equipment maker's focus on China, where the construction market is expected to keep surging. The stock rose $2.38, or 3.2 percent, to $76.58.   

Oil prices were volatile amid end-of-year position taking and anticipation of Tuesday's Fed meeting. Light, sweet crude reversed course to close down 42 cents to $87.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.68, or 0.72 percent, to 791.22.   

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by slightly less than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 2.81 billion shares, compared with 2.88 billion shares on Friday.   

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average closed down 0.20 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.18 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.16 percent, Germany's DAX index rose 0.49 percent, and France's CAC-40 increased 0.56 percent.

 HDDollar strengthens against euro, falls to yen following Fed decision to cut interest rates      BYBy JACKIE FARWELL      CRAP Business Writer   WC542 words   PD11 December 2007   ET22:15   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2007.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - The dollar rose against the euro but fell versus the yen Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed a key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, falling short of some traders' expectations.   

The Fed cut its benchmark federal funds rate to 4.25 percent, marking the third reduction in three months. The central bank signaled that further cuts were possible if a severe downturn in housing and a crisis in mortgage lending worsen.   
   TDThe Fed also reduced its discount rate, the interest it charges to make direct loans to banks, by a quarter-point to 4.75 percent.   

Currency traders had priced in a quarter-point cut to the federal funds rate, with some expectations for a half-point reduction, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. The Fed's decision left investors skeptical of the central bank's ability to get ahead of the credit crunch gripping U.S. markets, Gilmore said.   

"I don't think this generates a major change in terms of the dollar," he said. "I think the Fed gets a 'C-minus' today for adequately addressing the credit crisis."   

Investors disappointed by the central bank's decision sold off stocks, sending the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting more than 300 points.   

Following the announcement, the dollar strengthened against the euro but dropped against the yen.   

The 13-nation currency fell to $1.4675 against the dollar from $1.4712 in New York late Monday. The dollar declined to 110.82 yen from 111.67 yen, as investors shied away from risky yen carry trades, which involve selling off the low-yielding yen in favor of higher-yielding dollars.   

The British pound dropped to $2.0356 from $2.0462.   

Used to jump-start an economy, lower interest rates typically weaken a currency by cutting into investors' returns on assets denominated in it. Recently, however, currency traders with hopes for a stronger economy have also weighed rate cuts' potential to avert a recession, boosting the dollar some.   

Tuesday's cut marks the Fed's third rate decrease since September amid mortgage problems in the U.S. that have tripped up borrowers and caused a credit crisis among banks -- fueling wider fears about the health of the U.S. economy.   

Despite recovering some in recent weeks, the U.S. currency took a hit after the Fed's two previous cuts, with a bolder-than-expected half-point decrease in September and a quarter-point cut at its Oct. 31 meeting.   

A weaker dollar is welcome news for some, including manufacturers who are eager to see American exports become more competitive. The slump has also spelled rising prices for imports and diminished spending power for American tourists overseas.   

Last week, the Bank of England cut its benchmark rate to 5.5 percent from 5.75 percent, but the European Central Bank left its rate unchanged at 4 percent.   

In a day otherwise light on economic data, the dollar bought 1.1319 Swiss francs, up from 1.1282 late Monday, and 1.0130 Canadian dollars, rising from 1.0073.
