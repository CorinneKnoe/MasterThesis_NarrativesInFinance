   LPThe mood of tentative optimism that has gripped financial markets in recent weeks took a knock yesterday as a weak batch of US economic data provided an unsettling backdrop to today's Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

Concerns about the financial sector remained to the fore after Deutsche Bank reported its first quarterly loss in five years and UK mortgage lender HBOS unveiled a cash call.
   TDMore worrying for the markets were dismal reports on US home prices and consumer confidence, which highlighted recession concerns just a day before the Federal Reserve is widely expected to signal a pause in its interest rate-cutting cycle.

"There is a sense that the consumer is besieged by a perfect storm of falling home values, fuel and food price increases, reduced access to credit and falling employment and income," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Global Banking and Markets.

The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index fell 2.6 per cent in February for a year-on-year drop of 12.7 per cent.

Rob Carnell at ING noted that the index has now registered 10 consecutive readings in which month-on-month percentage declines have been greater than in the previous month.

"In short, there is no sign of US house prices bottoming and there is no way that such a trough can be extrapolated from continually worsening data," he said.

A report from research company Realtytrac added to the discomfort as it showed US home foreclosure filings had jumped 23 per cent in the first three months of the year from the last quarter of 2007 and had more than doubled from a year earlier.

Meanwhile, the Conference Board's measure of US consumer confidence slipped to 62.3 in April, the lowest reading since March 2003 and the fourth successive decline.

Although the headline reading was actually slightly better than the markets had expected, analysts noted some worrying pointers for the labour market.

"The labour differential reached minus 11.3 with consumers finding jobs 'plentiful' declining and those finding jobs 'hard to get' increasing in April," said Adam York, economic analyst at Wachovia.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point cut in the Fed Funds rate today to 2 per cent, although all eyes will be on the US central bank's accompanying statement.

Gavin Friend, FX strategist at Commerzbank, argued that a Fed statement paving the way for a possible pause in the easing cycle was likely, but cautioned that the US economy remained on course for a protracted period of below-trend growth.

"Thus we warn against getting carried away with the likely 'Fed is done' mood that may sweep through the market," he said.

US and European equity markets retreated as losses for financial stocks outweighed gains in the energy sector. By mid-afternoon in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent, with Merck sharply lower after regulators rejected one of its new drugs.

In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index broke a four-day winning run to end 0.8 per cent lower, in spite of hefty gains for oil heavyweights BP and Shell.

Asia was subdued by the close of Japanese markets for a public holiday. Hong Kong rose 1 per cent to a three-month high and Shanghai gained 1.4 per cent.

The recent rally for credit markets came to a halt, with the investment-grade iTraxx Europe index widening1 basis point to 73.5bp and the US CDX index up 3bp at 96bp.

US government bonds were lifted by flight-to-safety buying following the release of the US economic figures. The yield on the two-year Treasury was down 3bp at 2.32 per cent while the 10-year yield was 2bp lower at 3.81 per cent.

European bonds followed Treasuries higher and got a further boost from weak French consumer confidence and Spanish retail sales figures. The 10-year Bund yield fell 7bp to 4.14 per cent.

On the currency markets, the French and Spanish data, plus Deutsche Bank's quarterly loss, helped drive the euro to a four-week low against the dollar.

In commodities, the firmer dollar helped send the oil price into retreat following the previous session's record high.

 HDFT.com site : Overview: Investors heartened by US economic data.   BYDave Shellock    WC759 words   PD1 May 2008   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPThe dollar rebounded and Wall Street stocks staged a solid advance on Thursday as investors digested yet another batch of US economic data and attempted to decipher the implications of the Federal Reserve's rate cut and statement on Wednesday.

However, activity was muted by the closure of much of continental Europe and Asia for public holidays.
   TDOn Wednesday, the Fed cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2 per cent, but offered no clear direction about future rate moves. The remarks were viewed by many as oblique and triggered a welter of analyst comment.

"Given the market's reaction to the FOMC rate decision, it seems it really did not know what to do with it," said Rudy Narvas, senior analyst at 4Cast Economics.

"The statement . . . seemed to be a touch more dovish than the last, but kept the window of opportunity open enough for the Fed to offer policy easing if necessary."

Lena Komileva, G7 economist at Tullett Prebon, said the Fed had now taken the stance of an "active observer", against a backdrop of adverse developments taking place in real economic growth, financial markets and inflation.

She added: "A 2 per cent level for the Fed funds rate does not represent a natural end of this easing cycle."

But Dean Maki and Julian Callow at Barclays Capital took a different tack. "We believe that this was the last Fed rate cut in this cycle and expect the Fed to keep rates on hold for most of the next year before raising them in early 2009," they said.

The day's US economic releases appeared to back that view.

Personal consumption grew by 0.4 per cent in March from the previous month, twice as much as expected, while manufacturing activity continued to contract in April but at a slower pace than had been feared.

The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for April came in at 48.6, unchanged on the month, against expectations that it would dip to 48. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.

However, the employment component of the report dropped from 49.2 to 45.4, the lowest reading since May 2003.

Concerns about the labour market had already been heightened by an unexpectedly large 35,000 increase in initial jobless claims in the latest week. The key US employment report for April is due out on Friday.

Meanwhile, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation - the price index for core personal consumption expenditure - edged up 0.2 per cent for a year-on-year increase of 2.1 per cent - again slightly more than forecast.

On the currency markets, expectations that US interest rates could be at - or at least close to - a bottom offered firm support to the dollar. The euro, by contrast, has been plagued by speculation that the deteriorating economic outlook for the eurozone will pressure the European Central Bank into lowering borrowing costs.

However, Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, noted that the Fed's more sanguine outlook had come against a background of an improvement in market sentiment and said: "This could also support the ECB's view that the eurozone can weather the storm, experiencing little more than the cyclical downturn which was already in the cards before the crisis hit," he said.

The euro fell to a five-week low of $1.5438, while the dollar rose 1.1 per cent against the Swiss franc and also edged up against the yen.

The dollar's rebound sent commodities prices sharply lower.

Gold briefly fell below $850 an ounce to touch a four-month low.

West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark oil price, fell more than $2 a barrel to trade below $111. At the start of the week, WTI hit a record high just shy of $120 a barrel.

Trading in equity markets was limited by holidays. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.6, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent.

In London, the FTSE 100 index ended unchanged, while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 0.6 per cent.

US government bonds were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 2 basis points to 3.71 per cent while the two-year yield was 2bp higher at 2.28 per cent. The 10-year UK Gilt yield fell 5bp to 4.62 per cent as falling commodity prices lessened inflation concerns.

   LPUncertainty continued to reign in financial markets on Wednesday as investors awaited a crucial interest rate announcement from the Federal Reserve and digested a raft of economic data from the US, Eurozone and Japan.

The most widely-watched release was the US first-quarter gross domestic product report. This showed that the US economy expanded at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent, slightly more than the consensus forecast and the same pace as in the last three months of 2007.
   TD"The rise, along with the recently announced faster pace of tax rebates, raises doubts as to whether or not real GDP will decline at all in 2008, leaving many people wondering what happened to the recession," said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia.

But Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the breakdown of the report indicated that the US economy had weakened noticeably from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.

He pointed out that real final sales to domestic purchasers slid by 0.4 per cent on an annual basis, the first negative reading since the 1990-91 recession.

"So, for all the debate about whether the economy is in a recession, the reality is that the underlying economy was weaker than it has been in almost 20 years," Mr Stanley said.

Nominally good news on the labour market front came from payrolls group ADP Employer Services, which said 10,000 private-sector jobs had been created in the US in April, compared with expectations of a decline of 70,000.

However, analysts noted that the ADP reports had recently been much stronger than the official employment data from the US Labour Department.

The headline GDP number and the ADP data offered support to the view that a pause in the Fed's easing cycle might be close.

The Bank of Japan left interest rates on hold as it lowered its growth forecasts but raised its inflation forecasts.

"The BoJ made it clear that it now has a neutral stance on rates," said Hiroshi Shiraishi at Lehman Brothers. "We continue to expect the BoJ to be on hold throughout this year and start hiking rates in the second half of 2009."

The BoJ's announcement followed news of a 3.1 per cent slump in Japanese factory output in March, a much bigger decline than had been expected.

The data, plus the lack of action by the BoJ, prompted a steep rise in Japanese government bonds as short-covering emerged following last week's plunge. The yield on the ten-year JGB fell 5 basis points to 1.57 per cent.

There was a steadier tone in the rest of the bond market ahead of the Fed's decision. The yield on the two-year US Treasury was unchanged at 2.36 per cent while in Europe, the two-year Schatz yield was 1bp lower at 3.76 per cent.

In the currency markets, the prospects for eurozone interest rates came back into focus after the European Commission's economic sentiment index fell to its lowest since August 2005 and inflation data for the region came in weaker than forecast.

Stephane Deo, economist at UBS, pointed out that in the past, the European Central Bank had reacted more to activity data than to inflation data. "We believe that the economy will continue to weaken and eventually generate a rate cut," he said. "We foresee the first cut in September."

The euro touched a one-month low against the dollar before recovering.

US and European equity markets advanced as investors took heart from the headline GDP figure and ADP report, plus encouraging earnings from the likes of Procter and Gamble and General Motors. and

By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent. It was a more mixed picture in Asia, with the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo slipping 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong easing 0.6 per cent, but Shanghai climbing 4.8 per cent and Seoul up 0.8 per cent.

Depsite the better tone to equities, credit spreads widened modestly, with the investment-grade iTraxx Europe and CDX north America indices both rising slightly.

In commodities, oil prices retreated on news of a big rise in US crude inventories last week, with West Teaxs Intermediate dipping below $114 a barrel.

 HDFT.com site : US investors cheer Fed rate cut.   BYJeremy Lemer in New York    WC740 words   PD30 April 2008   SNFinancial Times (FT.Com)   SCFTCOM   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPWall Street stocks climbed on Wednesday, pushing equity markets to their biggest monthly gains in five years, as investors cheered a rate cut from the Federal Reserve and some decent corporate results.

In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Open Markets Committee cut its main interest rate 25 basis points to 2 per cent and warned that tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction were "likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."
   TDThose comments and weak growth figures released on Wednesday morning, which showed the US economy only narrowly avoided outright contraction in the first quarter, may make further cuts more likely, some analysts said, boosting equity markets.

According to the Commerce Department, first- quarter GDP growth was a sluggish 0.6 per cent. On the positive side, core prices, a measure of inflation, rose a less-than-expected 2.2 per cent.

In April as a whole, the S&P 500 added about 5.7 per cent thanks to strong results from the likes of Google which have helped ease fears about the likely fallout from a US slowdown.

That performance marks the index's best monthly showing since April 2003 and its first positive month since October of last year.

Scott Armiger, a portfolio manager with Christiana Bank and Trust, said: "Excluding financials most corporations have met or exceeded earnings expectations this quarter, although those expectations were very low."

With all ten key sectors in positive territory by mid-afternoon in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent to 1,402.08 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 12,983.30. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,451.19.

Wednesday's portion of earnings reports exemplified the resilience that many companies have shown over during the first quarter earnings season, particularly large-caps with an exposure to foreign markets.

Industrials have climbed 2.3 per cent over the month and on Wednesday estimate-beating resluts from Ingersoll-Rand and Cummins added to that trend. Ingersoll rose 5.4 per cent to $44.85 while Cummins gained 8.9 per cent to $62.65.

Over the month though, Energy stocks were the star performers surging about 10 per cent as oil flirted with the $120 a barrel level and prices for coal and gas also rose. Oil services companies Smith International and Baker Hughes led the way, jumping about 20 per cent to $75.84 and $80.22 respectively.

Technology stocks also had a banner month rising 8.4 per cent after a number of industry bellwethers reported stronger than expected results. Google surged about 32 per cent to $580.90, while Micron Technology jumped about 41 per cent to $7.74 and Apple gained 24 per cent to $177.81.

On Wednesday financials were in focus after Citigroup, the biggest US bank, announced plans to sell $4.5bn of stock to shore up its balance sheet.

The shares slipped 2.8 per cent on Wednesday, but were up by about 20 per cent to $25.48 over the month.

In April as a whole, the sector added 7.9 per cent thanks to deal activity and less-bad than feared results from a handful of major investment banks. Safeco, which agreed to be bought by Liberty Mutual for $6.2bn, more than doubled in value to $66.72, while Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers rose 26 per cent to $50.56 and 22 per cent to $46.32.

Consumer staples rallied strongly on Wednesday thanks to a handful of better-than-expected results from the industry heavyweights, including Procter&Gamble and Kraft Foods, but in April the sector was a relative laggard climbing only 0.7 per cent.

P&G shares rose 3.3 per cent to $67.90 while Kraft added 3.6 per cent to $31.89 on Wednesday.

Throughout April, data has consistently shown declining consumer confidence and anaemic consumer spending but the sector has performed vigorously, led by an unlikely pair.

Over the month Ford shares jumped by about 47 per cent to $8.40 on strong earnings, while smaller than expected losses at General Motors, reported on Wednesday, helped the company to hit $23.86, adding nearly 25 per cent to its value.

 CLMCurrency Trading   HDWeak Data From Europe, Fed Rate Talk Lift Dollar   BYBy Dan Molinski      WC323 words   PD30 April 2008   SNThe Wall Street Journal   SCJ   PGC5   LAEnglish   CY(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   
   LPNEW YORK -- The dollar strengthened against the euro Tuesday on weak data from the euro zone and expectations the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates by a small increment Wednesday and signal it plans no further cuts.

The euro traded late in the day at $1.5566, down from $1.5640 late Monday and a nearly four-week low.
   TDThe initial selloff in the common currency came during the London trading session, after news that French consumer confidence fell to a record low in April and a euro-zone retailing index plunged. This reinforced attitudes that the economies of Europe are succumbing to the spill-over effects of the U.S. economic downturn.

Also supporting the dollar Tuesday was market sentiment that the Fed's string of aggressive rate cuts to mend the U.S. economy -- which have been a thorn in the dollar's side -- are at an end, or will at least be put on hold for a while.

Stock markets have been stable in recent weeks, and company earnings for the first quarter weren't as bad as feared, reducing the sense of urgency on the part of the Fed, even as economic data continue to look dire.

Interest-rate futures reflect expectations for just a quarter-percentage-point cut from the Fed Wednesday, which would trim the benchmark federal-funds rate to 2%. There is a small camp that believes the Fed may leave the rate unchanged.

Tuesday afternoon in New York, the dollar was at 104.02 yen, down from 104.19 yen late Monday. The euro was at 161.91 yen from 162.95. The British pound was at $1.9687 from $1.9901, and the dollar was at 1.0375 Swiss francs from 1.0346.

 Fed Paying Interest on Reserves: an Old Idea With a New Urgency

By Steven K. Beckner

     WASHINGTON (MNI) - If you're looking for a "pause" signal in the 
Federal Reserve's Wednesday afternoon interest rate cut announcement, 
you won't find it. 

     The Fed could, of course, take a pause in its monetary easing over 
the next few months, but that is not preordained. And it is certainly 
not clearly indicated in the statement which the Fed's rate-setting 
Federal Open Market Committee issued after two days of meetings. 

     If the Fed does end up pausing, it will be because financial and 
economic conditions improve between now and its next regular policy 
meeting, scheduled for June 24-25. So far, the rate announcement 
suggests, the FOMC consensus remains quite concerned about how financial 
distress might affect the economic outlook and, thus, disinclined to 
rule out further rate cuts.  

     The announcement did contain significant changes in wording, but it 
neither completely removed the easing bias nor signaled a pause. As if 
to confirm that the Fed has not gone to a neutral or stand-pat stance, 
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia 
Fed President Charles Plosser again dissented as the FOMC lowered rates 
again and vowed once more to "act as needed." 

     The FOMC cut the federal funds, at which banks borrow from each 
other overnight, 25 basis points to 2.0%. The FOMC has now cut the 
overnight money market rate by 325 basis points since the subprime 
mortgage crisis erupted last summer. 

     The Fed Board of Governors, acting on requests from four Federal 
Reserve Banks, simultaneously cut the discount rate, at which the Fed 
itself lends to banks, the same amount to 2.25%. That rate has now been 
lowered by 400 basis points. 

     In addition, the Fed has used three new credit facilities to lend 
aggressively to financial institutions, including investment banks, 
against a broad range of collateral, including mortgage-backed 
securities. 

     In their rate announcement, Chairman Ben Bernanke and his 
colleagues softened their bias toward further rate cuts, but did not 
remove it. They did take out the words, "downside risks to growth 
remain." But they otherwise continued to put their emphasis on concerns  
about weak growth and stressed financial markets, not on inflation 
pressures. 

     In the policy paragraph of the rate announcement, the FOMC said, 
"The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with 
ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote 
moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity. 
The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial 
developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic 
growth and price stability." 

     But earlier in the announcement, the FOMC retained an implicit 
easing bias by stating, "Recent information indicates that economic 
activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued 
and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under 
considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening 
housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next 
few quarters." 

     This characterization of economic and financial conditions differs 
somewhat from that included in the March 18 FOMC statement. But, on the 
whole, it does not seem to reflect much, if any, brightening of Fed 
policymakers' economic outlook. 

     Instead of saying "the outlook for economic activity has weakened 
further," as it did in March, the FOMC now says, "economic activity 
remains weak." In other respects, the latest statement can be read as 
even gloomier. Whereas the March statement noted that "labor markets 
have softened," the April statement says "labor markets have softened 
further." 

     And whereas the March statement observed that "growth in consumer 
spending has slowed," the latest statement adds a note of concern about 
demand from the business sector: "Household AND business spending has 
been subdued." (emphasis added) 

     It is also significant that the FOMC gave no hint of great comfort 
with what's going on in financial markets. The latest rate 
announcement's characterization of credit conditions and their likely 
economic impact differs very little from the wording used on March 18. 

     Equally noteworthy is that the FOMC did not heighten its concern 
about inflation. Indeed, if anything, it softened its concerns. 

     "Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy 
and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of 
inflation expectations have risen in recent months," the latest rate 
announcement says. "The Committee expects inflation to moderate in 
coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other 
commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization." 

     "Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high," it 
continues. "It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation 
developments carefully." 

     On March 18, the FOMC had said, "Inflation has been elevated, and 
some indicators of inflation expectations have risen.  The Committee 
expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected 
leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of 
pressures on resource utilization.  Still, uncertainty about the 
inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to 
monitor inflation developments carefully." 

     At most, what the FOMC has potentially done with its latest rate 
announcement is to set the stage for a more bluntly symmetrical policy 
stance and an eventual normalization of rates sometime in the future -- 
but only if and when economic and financial data become more favorable. 

     For now the easing option remains wide open.

 HDMORTGAGES/AGENCIES - Sectors widen ahead of payrolls data   BYBy Julie Haviv      WC633 words   PD1 May 2008   ET22:04   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - Yield spreads on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac U.S. mortgage-backed securities and most agency debt widened against Treasuries on Thursday, opening the month on a soft note ahead of key data gauging the state of the labor market.

Friday's U.S. payrolls report is typically one of the key market movers every month, primarily because the central bank is heavily reliant on economic data.
   TDThe Labor Department is expected to report that employment fell in April for the fourth straight month.

Mortgage bonds had a banner month in April, largely due to robust buying from an array of investors, particularly government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . Overseas demand from Asia, in particular, also played a pivotal, analysts say.

Investors in general have increased their risk appetite in recent weeks, becoming more comfortable buying spread products as the credit crisis showed signs of easing.

Other factors have also benefited mortgage bonds.

"Lower implied volatility is playing a large role and is behind a lot of the strong performance of mortgage bonds," said Nicholas Strand, a manager with the mortgage strategy group at Barclays Capital in New York.

"While mortgage bonds have outperformed Treasuries recently, there are still risks on the horizon and mortgage credit problems still pose a threat," he said.

The yield premium on Fannie Mae MBS paying 5.50 percent interest against the benchmark 10-year Treasury note widened to 1.534 percentage points on Thursday from 1.512 percentage points on Wednesday, according to Reuters data.

Sharp changes in interest rates hurt mortgage bonds by increasing implied volatility and raising the cost to hedge against homeowners prepaying loans that make up MBS bonds at a faster or slower pace than anticipated.

Market participants were also mulling Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates and revise the accompanying statement.

The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, lowered the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2 percent, the lowest since December 2004. It was seventh reduction in a campaign that has brought rates down by 3.25 percentage points since mid-September 2007.

The Federal Reserve signaled that its interest-rate cutting campaign may be nearing an end.

Mortgage bonds should thrive after a Federal Reserve pause, according to Citigroup.

Historical Citigroup mortgage spread data shows that U.S. mortgage-backed securities initially underperform Treasuries during the first month following the last ease of the Federal Reserve easing cycle.

"After the initial month of uncertainty, mortgages begin to rally and outperform Treasuries well into the sixth month after the easing halt," the company said in research published on Thursday.

Active 15- and 30-year mortgage securities were 2/32 lower to 4/32 higher. Bond equivalent yields on 30-year 5.50 percent coupon MBS ranged from 5.185 percent to 5.307 percent.

Prices on 30-year 6 percent coupons were 2/32 higher. Bond equivalent yields ranged from 5.026 percent to 5.102 percent.

Fannie Mae 5.375 percent 10-year benchmark notes due June 12, 2017, were 0.5 basis points wider at 54 basis points bid and 52 basis points offered over Treasuries.

U.S. Treasury debt prices eased as soaring stocks squashed the safe-haven bid for government debt and investors raised their expectations the Federal Reserve will pause in its interest-rate cutting campaign.

U.S. 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> traded 5/32 lower at 97-29/32 to yield 3.755 percent. Yields, which move inversely to price, were at 3.763 percent late Wednesday. (Editing by Gary Crosse)

 SEWORLD NEWS   HDPolicymakers discuss paying interest on reserves.   BYBy KRISHNA GUHA    WC177 words   PD1 May 2008   SNFinancial Times   SCFTFT   EDLondon Ed2   PGPage 6   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved 
   LPThe most consequential discussion at the Federal Reserve yesterday could turn out to be not the debate on interest rates but rather a separate meeting on paying interest on bank reserves, writes Krishna Guha in Washington .

Paying interest on reserves is one of three ways in which the US central bank could expand its liquidity operations beyond the current size of its balance sheet - roughly Dollars 800bn (Pounds 403bn) - without losing control of the main interest rate, the Fed funds rate.
   TDThe other options would be for the Treasury to issue excess bonds and give them to the Fed to swap for other securities, or for the Fed itself to issue sterilisation bonds to mop up the extra reserves it supplies.

The Fed is authorised to pay interest on reserves from 2011.

Yesterday's meeting related to that timetable. But it would be surprising if some Fed policymakers did not raise the possibility of bringing forward this authority to help tackle the credit crisis.

NOTES:

If rates change more than once a month, the last rate for that month is listed.

1. On March 9, 2006 the BOJ said it would no longer set a target for the amount of surplus funds in the money market, ending its "quantitative easing" policy, and adopted a more conventional tactic of guiding the unsecured overnight call rate. On July 14, 2006 it raised interest rates for the first time in six years.

2. The Swiss National Bank targets a range for the three-month Swiss franc LIBOR rate. It currently targets roughly the midpoint of that range.

3. Table shows the Bank of Mexico's overnight lending rate. This replaces monthly averages of yields on 28-day Cetes treasury bills at weekly open market operations, as shown in past tables.

4. On Jan. 17, 2007 the Bank of Thailand set a new policy rate based on the 1-day repurchase rate <BOT15>, instead of the 14-day rate. The rate was set at 4.75 percent, compared with the market close that day of 4.9375 percent. Comparison in the table for the end of 2006 shows the 14-day rate. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 HD Federal Reserve 's statement explaining decision to lower key  interest rate  one-quarter point   BYBy The Associated Press      WC336 words   PD30 April 2008   ET20:39   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPThe Federal Reserve's interest rate statement Wednesday:

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2 percent.
   TDRecent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.

Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.

The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.

Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against were Richard W. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser, who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.

In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2 1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco.

     SYDNEY, May 1 (MNI) - The U.S. dollar edged lower in late morning 
trade here Thursday after the Federal Reserve left open the possibility 
of further rate cuts after another quarter-point reduction overnight. 

     Trading was thin with most markets in Asia closed for a public 
holiday apart from Japan and Australia. 

     Traders said the statement accompanying the Federal Open Market 
Committee's decision to cut the federal funds target rate to 2.00% did 
not decisively signal an end to the central bank's easing campaign. 

     "Market pricing suggests the statement left more room for easing 
than had been expected," said Rob Henderson, chief economist at NAB 
Capital Markets. 

     He said the Fed funds futures had built in more chances of a 
near-term easing and had reduced the possibility of further tightening 
from late 2008 into 2009. 

     "Importantly, the statement that 'downside risks to growth remain' 
was removed, the clearest indication that the Fed has moved to a more 
neutral policy bias," said Henderson. 

     He said from Friday's release of the April non-farm payrolls data 
onwards, data will dictate the Fed's policy moves. 

     "Since our forecasts are for worse data ahead, we continue to 
expect another 25 basis point (cut) at the June meeting," said 
Henderson. 

     The median estimate in a MNI survey of economists looks for April 
non-farm payrolls to fall by 75,000 and the unemployment rate to rise to 
5.2% from 5.1%. Respective estimates range from -110,000 to -25,000 and 
5.0% to 5.2%. 

     NAB Capital Markets' view is despite data showing that U.S. gross 
domestic product grew 0.6% in the first quarter, the same pace as the 
fourth quarter's, but better than market expectations for 0.2% growth. 

     At 11:25 a.m. here (0125 GMT), the dollar was at Y103.72 against 
the yen compared with Y103.91 in late New York trade where it lost 
ground after the Fed's rate decision. The euro was at $1.5640 from 
$1.5622. 

     Andrew Spencer, a foreign exchange analyst at Thomson IFR, agreed 
that the Fed's statement that it would "act as needed to promote 
growth", left the door open for further action, though in other comments 
policymakers signalled that they were comfortable with the current level 
of interest rates. 

     "The dollar is slightly softer, with the door still open for 
further U.S. interest rate cuts if required, but European data continues 
to show weakness, so the market is undecided on the next move in the 
dollar," Spencer said. 

     He said carry trades were higher, but as data continue to look soft 
in the United States, Europe and Australasia, carry-trade currencies 
such as the New Zealand and Australian dollars should come under 
pressure. 

     "Today is a holiday in most of Asia, so we expect a choppy illiquid 
session," Spencer said.

     SINGAPORE, Apr. 30 (MNI) - The U.S. dollar eased back from early 
highs around midday here to trade almost flat from New York closing 
levels after the Bank of Japan announced it was keeping rates on hold. 

     As expected, the Bank of Japan monetary policy board voted 
unanimously to maintain the target for the unsecured overnight call loan 
rate at 0.5% amid growing downside risks to the Japanese economy and 
uncertainties over global growth and credit markets. 

     Dollar-yen had slipped to a Y103.88 low early in the session but 
subsequently rebounded to a Y104.22 high in choppy, illiquid trade in 
Asia. A cautious tone prevailed before the BOJ's decision and tonight's 
outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 

     Federal Reserve policymakers are expected to cut the Fed funds 
target rate a further 25 basis points to 2.00%, but foreign exchange 
strategists say the dollar's direction will be largely determined by the 
medium-term outlook given in the FOMC's statement. 

     "The dollar rally continued as more investors bet a U.S. rate cut 
to 2% today will be the last as the Fed turns its attention to 
inflation," noted analysts at LGT Asia. 

     Dollar-yen had begun to ease back from the morning high prior to 
the BOJ announcement, mainly due to a series of sell orders from around 
Y104.30/40 and toward a Y105.00 option barrier, dealers said. 

     The pair slipped further to Y104.01 soon after the BOJ decision was 
announced, placing it almost flat from where it ended in New York. 
Attention has since moved to the release of the bank's semi-annual 
Outlook report due at 3 pm JST today, to be followed by BOJ Governor 
Masaaki Shirakawa's news briefing. 

     "More importantly, guidance from the central bank over the 
macroeconomic outlook will not paint a picture rosy enough to justify 
interest rate hikes this year," said DBS Bank analysts. 

     Euro-dollar, meanwhile, stood at $1.5573 at midday, barely changed 
from $1.5565 at the close of the US session overnight. 

     The pair started the Asian morning within a narrow $1.5560 to 
$1.5578 range, as early bids from UK names drove the pair up to the 
initial high. 

     The pair slipped modestly around midmorning but regained its 
footing soon after, for a rebound to $1.5570/75, just after midday. 

     "There's still talk of stops below $1.5520-30, but euro-dollar will 
probably stay range-bound within $1.5540 to $1.5630 ahead of tonight's 
US GDP release and the FOMC decision," commented dealers at UBS AG.

 HDFed seen cutting U.S. rates as consumer hopes swoon   WC806 words   PD29 April 2008   ET20:01   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on Tuesday that was expected to end with a small interest rate cut that could be the last in a string of reductions dating to mid-September.

The U.S. central bank opened its policy-setting meeting at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT), a Fed official said. A decision on rates is expected to be announced about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday.
   TDFinancial markets widely expect the Fed to lower benchmark overnight rates by a quarter-percentage point to 2 percent, which would the lowest since December 2004, and offer a hint the rate cutting may be at an end. Interest rate futures prices implied a small probability the Fed could leave rates unchanged.

The meeting began after fresh reminders of the deep trouble the economy faces from a combination of fading growth and soaring prices for energy and commodities that is pushing supermarket food prices to new highs and causing growing unease among both consumers and Fed officials.

The Conference Board said at mid-morning that its Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 62.3 in April from a revised 65.9 in March. At the same time, new data from the closely watched Standard & Poor's/Case Schiller home price index showed a continued plunge in prices of existing homes in February.

Some 17 of 20 measured regions had record annual falls in home prices. "There is no sign of a bottom in the numbers," said David Blitzer, chairman of S&P's index committee.

In a sign of rising distress, real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Tuesday that U.S. home foreclosure filings jumped 23 percent in the first three months of the year from the last quarter of 2007. Foreclosure filings were more than double that of a year earlier.

ON RECESSION'S EDGE

The cascading evidence of economic malaise -- likely to be reinforced when the government issues its first estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Wednesday -- means the Fed will likely say that it remains more concerned about economic weakness than mounting prices.

However, it may also draw attention to the deep rate cuts already put in place and imply it wants time to assess whether they are enough to foster a return to stronger growth later in the year.

The Fed has lowered the overnight federal funds rate to 2.25 percent from 5.25 percent in six steps since mid-September, but there still are ongoing credit strains and no signs yet the housing market has reached bottom.

The GDP report is forecast to show only a slight 0.2 percent annual rate of economic growth in the first quarter, down from 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter and teetering on the verge of outright contraction.

Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke conceded the economy had weakened since January. "It now appears likely that real gross domestic product will not grow much, if at all, over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly," the Fed chief said.

U.S. President George W. Bush said on Tuesday that he was deeply concerned about U.S. and world food prices and suggested he was ready to consider a moratorium on gasoline taxes this summer.

But with pump prices heading toward $4 a gallon, he warned there was little excess capacity to pump more oil and said the economy inescapably faced "tough times."

Persistent price pressures, particularly for food and gasoline, have already put some Fed officials on high alert and have led some economists to warn that the central bank's actions were undermining the U.S. dollar in a way that was fueling commodity inflation.

Two officials -- Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher -- voted against the hefty three-quarter point rate cut put in place at the Fed's last meeting on March 18.

Plosser came close to saying earlier this month that he felt the Fed was leaning too heavily in favor of stimulating growth and was taking a risk of creating conditions that might make it difficult to get prices under control in future.

"The role of monetary policy is to ensure the stability of the purchasing power of the nation's currency, so that markets are not distorted by inflation," Plosser said. "To ensure the credibility of monetary policy we should never ask monetary policy to do more than it can do." (Reporting by Glenn Somerville; Editing by Andrea Ricci)

     Apr30-Jean-Claude Trichet said, it is essential to avoid 
second-round effects on wages and prices in order to maintain eurozone 
price stability, and the ECB is following wage rounds with special 
attention. "In this context, it is the belief of the Governing Council 
that features that enforce wage rigidity and lead to non-optimal wage 
setting, in particular, general indexation of nominal wages to the 
consumer price index, should be avoided...This is particularly relevant 
today: second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy 
and food prices on wage- and price-setting behavior must be avoided." 
     Apr30-Vitor Constancio said, Eurozone economic growth will benefit 
this year because of the momentum built up in 2007. Said: "It will be 
very hard for the euro zone only to grow by 1.4 percent (in 2008) when 
we have a carry over effect from 2007." Said: "At the moment it is 
difficult to talk about 2009 with the turbulence that we know." 
     Apr29-Jean-Claude Trichet said, the ECB's current monetary policy 
helps ensure medium-term price stability. Said: "The at times strong 
exchange rate moves are naturally grounds for concern." Said, credit 
conditions have tightened and the ECB has to monitor this "closely." 
"What we are observing in the first quarter of 2008 is that the economy 
was quite robust and in the first half of the year it will probably be 
reasonably resilient...At this stage we consider that the projection of 
the IMF for the EU may be too pessimistic. We will see what happens." 
Major currencies' exchange rates have been subject to "sharp 
fluctuations" at times and the ECB is "concerned about their possible 
implications for economic and financial stability," Trichet said. 
    Apr29-Nout Wellink said, the deceleration of German consumer 
inflation in April is "not a reason to change our policies." He urged 
caution in interpreting the slowdown of M3 money supply growth reported 
last Friday, saying that these are "very complex figures." Said: "But 
it's a signal, potentially at least, that things in Europe are slowing 
down a little bit." Endorsed the view that the ECB has no room to ease 
policy while inflation remains elevated. Said when asked about the 
possibility of raising rates: "I'm satisfied with the present policies," 
which he said "contribute to containing inflation."
     Apr28-Yves Mersch Said: "...Risks weighing on price stability 
remain tilted to the upside."  Said, these risks include additional 
price rises for commodities as well as a possible increase in upward 
pressure on wages and consumer prices. Said, while private consumption 
will suffer from the effect on disposable household income of more 
expensive raw materials, this effect will be offset by higher 
employment. Said: "We can't have second-round effects."  
     Apr28-Jean-Claude Trichet said, the current monetary policy stance 
of the ECB will help ensure medium-term price stability and anchor 
inflation expectations. Said: "...We believe that the current monetary 
policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective of price 
stability in the medium term and of firm anchoring of medium to long 
term inflation expectations." Said, especially now, the ECB's "strong 
commitment to preserve price stability over the medium term is of the 
essence." 
     Apr25-Miguel Fernandez Ordonez said, the ECB must bring eurozone 
inflation below 2% and its current monetary policy stance is appropriate 
for this at the moment. "Inflation has increased notably in the past few 
months and our target is for it to decline to under 2%."  Said, with 
inflation at the highest rate in the past 15 years, the ECB "must be 
watchful." Said: "We have decided to maintain rates because we think it 
is the best policy to avoid second-round effects...Our duty on the ECB 
is to make sure inflation returns to the target of 2%." 
     Apr25-Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said: "Just to state the obvious, 
once certain inflation perceptions persist in the public's opinion they 
will not be corrected by technical explanations of statistical 
methodologies." Said: "It has even been argued that globalization may 
undermine the ability of national central banks to control the dynamics 
of domestic inflation, and ultimately lead central bankers to relinquish 
their autonomy in favor of some mechanism of coordination among national 
monetary policies."  
     Apr25-Axel Weber said, market tensions are continuing and the total 
cost of the turbulence remains unclear. "It looks as though the tensions 
on financial markets are not yet over." 
     Apr24-Michael Bonello said: "I do not think that there is anyone 
who is considering higher interest rates...On the basis of the data we 
have at hand and the ECB's rationale for monetary policy strategy it is 
very difficult to make an argument for higher interest rates...I think 
current interest rates are sufficient for the medium-term strategy." He 
later noted that he was only speaking for himself and could not "presume 
to reflect the thinking today of the Governing Council." 
     Apr24-Jean-Claude Trichet said: the ECB is concerned about the 
potential impact of volatility in foreign exchange markets on economic 
and financial stability. Said: "I will add that more than ever, what is 
said by the U.S. authorities -- at the level of the President, the 
Minister of Finance and [Federal Reserve Chairman] Ben Bernanke -- on 
the fact that the strong dollar is in the interest of the United States 
is very important." 
     Apr24-Juergen Stark said the the monetary and financing conditions 
have tightened. "I think this is...something which over time ... will 
have a dampening impact on the inflation rate." He noted that past rate 
increases are having some impact on the monetary aggregates. Thus, "we 
believe the current monetary policy stance will contributing to 
achieving our medium-term objective." The Governing Council still 
expects inflation in the eurozone to ease at the end of 2008 and in 
2009, he said. "We expect that second-round effects...remain under 
control," however, "we cannot influence...the ongoing oil price 
increases and the increases in food prices." He also said the ECB's 
monetary pillar has been an anchor for monetary policy's medium-term 
focus amid the current storm of short-term forces. 
     Apr24-Jean-Claude Trichet said: "We believe that the current 
monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective, which 
is price stability and being credible in delivering price stability so 
that we anchor inflation expectations." He also said: "We have observed 
during the recent period of time sharp fluctuations, and we are 
concerned about their possible implication for financial and economic 
stability...I will add that more than ever, what is said by the U.S. 
authorities -- at the level of the President, the Minister of Finance 
and [Federal Reserve Chairman] Ben Bernanke -- on the fact that the 
strong dollar is in the interest of the United States is very 
important." 
     Apr22-Christian Noyer said earlier remarks were over-interpreted. 
Said: "Movements can go both ways...I would never engage in a discussion 
about the future path of interest rates, simply because nobody knows. It 
would be dangerous to make predictions in either direction." Said 
inflation will creep below the ECB's ceiling of 2% "between the end of 
this year and next spring" assuming that no second-round effects emerge 
and that there is no dramatic further increase in energy and commodity 
prices. 
     Apr22-Nicholas Garganas said: "The ECB Council has confirmed...it 
will prevent second round effects from materializing from the increase 
in oil and food prices."  Said: "It's not possible to make predictions 
on future interest rate directions. It will depend on future inflation 
data." Said he expected the headline inflation rate to stay well above 
2%, the ECB's price stability threshold, for the rest of this year. 
     Apr22-Christian Noyer said, the ECB is prepared to adjust interest 
rates to assure that inflation returns below 2% next year. "Our big 
problem is to ensure that inflation comes back below 2% next year...If 
necessary, we will adjust interest rates." Said: "We must not think that 
inflation is back. We have a surge in inflation because international 
tensions [in energy and commodity prices] are very strong...It's 
impossible for things to continue like this." 
     Apr21-Yves Mersch said it is increasingly probable that the ECB's 
staff forecasts for eurozone inflation will need to be raised. Eurozone 
inflation will "probably be in numbers above 3.0% into late autumn" of 
this year and "that will unavoidably have spillover effects into 2009." 
In contrast to their inflation counterparts, eurozone GDP forecasts may 
need cutting. 
     Apr21-Lucas Papademos said the inflationary impact of rising food 
and energy prices will last some time and he warned that they must not 
be allowed to seep more broadly into the eurozone economy in a way that 
would allow inflation to become entrenched. "There should be no doubt 
that the preservation of price stability is the primary objective and 
responsibility, and the stance of monetary policy is fundamentally 
determined by this objective."

 HDFed poised to cut rates; may take a break after that   BYBy JEANNINE AVERSA      CRAP Economics Writer   WC559 words   PD29 April 2008   ET22:38   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve is poised to deliver another interest rate cut to millions of people and businesses this week, although that could be the last break they get for a while.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues opened a two-day meeting Tuesday afternoon to take a fresh pulse on the economy and decide their next move on interest rates.
   TDThe Fed is widely expected to lower its key interest rate by one-quarter percentage point to 2 percent at the end of its session Wednesday.

That would mark a modest rate reduction after a recent string of hefty cuts. The Fed is facing a difficult juggling act of trying to shore up the faltering economy while also trying to keep inflation from taking off.

In response to the Fed's expected action, the prime lending rate for millions of consumers and businesses would fall by a corresponding amount, to 5 percent. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans. Both rates would be the lowest since late 2004.

Economists think the Fed may leave rates at such low levels possibly through the rest of this year and maybe into next year.

The Fed started cutting rates last September to aid the economy. But galloping food and energy prices have prompted fears that they could spread inflation throughout the economy. And that's complicating the Fed's job.

President Bush, in a Rose Garden news conference Tuesday that dwelled largely on the economy, said he understands Americans' anxiety over high gasoline prices. "If there was a magic wand to say, `OK drop price,' I'd do that," he said.

Gas prices hit a new record of $3.607 a gallon on Tuesday, according to a survey of stations by AAA and the Oil Price Information Service.

The economy has weakened meanwhile, strained by housing, credit and financial debacles.

On Wall Street, investors showed caution ahead of the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones industrials lost 39.81 points to close at 12,831.94.

Growth during the January-March quarter is expected to have slowed to an anemic pace of just 0.5 percent. The government releases a report on the first-quarter's performance on Wednesday. Bush said he hadn't been briefed on the figures but said, "I think they'll show that it's a very slow economy."

A growing number of analysts believe the economy has fallen into a recession and is contracting now.

"People -- economists can argue over the terminology," Bush said, refusing to put a recession label on the economic climate. "These are difficult times," he acknowledged. "You know the average person doesn't really care what we call it," he said.

Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, sank to a five-year low in April, as rising gas prices and higher unemployment put people in a more gloomy mind-set.

Bush and Fed officials are hoping that the government's $168 billion stimulus package -- including tax rebates, which started flowing to bank accounts on Monday -- will help give the economy an energizing jolt in the second half of this year.

 HDDollar rises as markets consider end to rate cuts   WC302 words   PD1 May 2008   ET21:42   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - The dollar gained strength Thursday amid mixed economic data following the Federal Reserve's signal that it might be done with interest-rate cutting for the near term.

The 15-nation euro dropped to $1.5461 in late New York trading, down from the $1.5642 it purchased Wednesday. The British pound also slid to $1.9737 from $1.9893.
   TDThe dollar rose to 105.26 Japanese yen, up from 104.17 late Wednesday.

The Commerce Department said consumer spending edged up 0.4 percent in March, while the Institute for Supply Management said an index of manufacturing activity in April was 48.6 for April, unchanged from March. Both readings, while weak, were better than expected and offset the 1.1 percent March drop in construction spending and the larger-than-expected jump in weekly jobless claims to 380,000.

The Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a quarter-point Wednesday, a smaller move than the aggressive easing it undertook earlier this year. There were signs the Fed may believe it has done enough to prevent a deep recession.

The Fed action pushed the federal funds rate down to 2 percent, the lowest level since late 2004. It marked the seventh rate cut by the central bank since it began easing credit conditions last September.

The European Central Bank has left rates unchanged at 4 percent.

Though lower interest rates can spur a nation's economy, they can weigh on its currency as traders transfer funds to countries where they can earn higher returns.

In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.0494 Swiss francs from 1.0338 francs late Wednesday in New York, and soared to 1.0187 Canadian dollars from 1.0046.

 HDUS TREASURY OUTLOOK-Markets mull Fed, ISM on eve of payrolls   BYBy Ellen Freilich      WC771 words   PD30 April 2008   ET23:46   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Interpreting the Federal Reserve's most recent statement, a nationwide manufacturing survey and anticipating a key employment report could lead to a day of position adjusting on Thursday.

The Fed lowered a key U.S. interest rate by a modest quarter-percentage point on Wednesday and hinted the move could be the last in a series dating to mid-September.
   TDBut it kept its options open, leaving investors uncertain as to whether more rate cuts were in store or whether the Fed felt it had eased monetary conditions enough to foster stronger growth.

In announcing its decision, the U.S. central bank pointed to the "substantial" reductions it has already put in place and noted that energy and other commodity prices were on the rise. It also dropped a reference contained in its last interest-rate announcement that "downside risks to growth remain."

Two Fed officials disagreed with the decision to cut rates, preferring no change.

The Fed's rate cut on Wednesday took the bellwether federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 2 percent, the lowest since December 2004. The Fed has cut 3.25 percentage points from that rate since mid-September.

"By no longer citing downside risks to growth, the Fed went out of its way to tell people they're done cutting rates, at least for the next few meetings," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi in New York.

"Whether that backs up yields in the short end of the yield curve and flattens the curve remains to be seen," he said.

This should keep the focus on stocks, Rupkey said.

"The stock market is the barometer of the health of the economy, the barometer of the credit risk factor," he said. "Generally, if the stock market is rising, credit market concerns tend to go by the wayside ... any rally in stocks, will be met by selling in bonds."

Stocks rallied immediately after the rate cut announcement on Wednesday, but erased all their gains by the closing bell. As stocks sold off, bond prices rallied.

Stone and McCarthy Research Associates analyst John Canavan said volatility in the stock and bond market after the Fed rate cut and statement on Wednesday reflected uncertainty about what the Fed statement meant in terms of the likelihood of more interest-rate cuts.

"Stocks decided that if 13,000 on the Dow continued to offer resistance, it was time to take some profits," he said.

Meanwhile, bonds should remain firmly bid on Thursday, helped by a "solid decline" in the April Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing index and by the "unwinding" of the novel notion that the Fed would raise interest rates by year-end, Canavan said.

If the Fed no longer cites a downside risk for the economy, it bolsters the case for equities and that's a negative for bonds, Rupkey said.

"But if the Fed is really done cutting rates, two-year notes should give up ground and the two-year yield should be rising to 2.4 percent or 2.5 percent and that has not happened," he said.

Rupkey said the new Fed statement could be one that "people will chatter about overnight and that the true direction of the market will develop overnight and Thursday morning.

"This is one of those statements that people have to think about for a while," he said.

A key unknown is what the U.S. Labor Department's report shows about job losses in April when the report comes out on Friday and with that report on the horizon, bonds could just trade cautiously on Thursday.

"If the ADP report (showing narrow job growth in April) was correct and jobs are up on Friday, bonds will give up substantial ground," Rupkey said.

"A plus number in employment, no matter how narrow, would be important," he said. "We're focused on recession and if numbers come along to contradict that idea, the bond market will have to adjust to that."

Even before Friday's employment report, the ISM number (due on Thursday) "could swing us around quite a bit," Rupkey said.

Economists polled by Reuters estimated that the April ISM manufacturing index would read 48.0, slightly lower than the March reading of 48.6. A reading below 50 points to contraction. A number above 50 points to growth. (Reporting by Ellen Freilich; editing by Gary Crosse)

 HDTREASURIES-Bonds rise as traders see Fed buying time   BYBy Richard Leong      WC679 words   PD30 April 2008   ET14:20   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Updates market action, changes byline)

NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. government debt prices rallied on Wednesday as traders saw the Federal Reserve leaving the door open to another interest rate cut as it balances the need to both forestall a recession and ease inflationary pressures.
   TDThere was a market view heading into the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that policy-makers might signal a decisive pause in their rate-cutting campaign. The U.S. central bank had already lowered the benchmark federal funds rate by 3 points since last September to combat a credit crunch and a prolonged housing slump.

But the latest Fed statement led traders to put on bets that there will be at least one Fed rate cut in the coming months.

"The take is that they have left the door for another move. I thought there would be a stronger language about they are coming to an end," said Daniel North, chief economist at Euler Hermes ACI in Owings Mills, Maryland.

Treasury prices fell immediately after the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy statement, which accompanied a widely expected quarter percentage point interest rate cut.

Prices gradually recovered, as traders reconsidered their initial hawkish interpretation of the Fed's statement. The post-FOMC rebound gained momentum in response to a late pullback in the stock market, along with month-end bond buying, traders and investors said. For the FOMC's statement, please see [ID:nN30530599]

Near-term risks to growth remain a worry for the Fed, analysts say, after preliminary government data showed the U.S. economy grew 0.6 percent in the first quarter, the same pace as the fourth quarter but above economists' expectations for a 0.2 percent rise.

The two-year Treasury note <US2YT=RR>, which is sensitive to the Fed's policy outlook, was up 4/32 in price at 99-21/32. Its yield which moves inversely with the price, was 2.30 percent, down 6 basis points on the day.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note <US10YT=RR> was up 17/32 at 97-28/32 with its yield at 3.76 percent, down 7 basis points.

In contrast to the rise in bonds, major U.S. stock closed down as much as 0.55 percent. For full Wall Street report, see [.N]

PAYROLLS NEXT

With the Fed's policy statement out of the way, investors are looking to Friday's government payrolls data for clues to the economy and whether the Fed will indeed take a break from its rate-cutting campaign.

Interest rate futures implied traders see roughly a 76 percent chance that the Fed will leave the fed funds target rate at 2 percent at its June 25 meeting. See [ID:nN30531428]

Earlier Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report showed a surprise 10,000 increase in private sector jobs in April, casting some doubts on forecasts for a big drop in April of U.S. nonfarm payrolls.

Economists on average are forecasting April non-farm payrolls to have fallen by 80,000 when the data is released on Friday, which would be on par with an 80,000 dip in March.

Another month of job losses would increase pressure on the Fed to pare interest rates further despite expectations a slowing economy will cool commodity demand, which has driven oil and food prices to record highs, analysts said.

Prior to the jobs report, traders will receive on Thursday data on car sales, weekly jobless claims and national manufacturing activity.

Among other cash maturities, five-year notes <US5YT=RR> were up 13/32 in price for a 3.04 percent yield, versus 3.12 percent late Tuesday, while 30-year bonds <US30YT=RR> were up 1-5/32 for a 4.49 percent yield, versus 4.56 percent late Tuesday.

LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Gold firmed more than 1 percent in early European trade on Thursday, lifted by the dollar's fall after the U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates, traders said.
   TDSpot gold <XAU=> was at $876.85/877.85 an ounce by 0641 GMT versus $864.65/866.05 an ounce in late New York on Wednesday. Bullion earlier jumped almost 2 percent to $881.30 an ounce in Asian trading.

"Gold has benefitted from a weak dollar, naturally," a UK-based trader said. "Rising oil prices are another support," he added.

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its interest rates as expected but left unclear whether the rate cuts will continue.

Fed's rate cut weighed on the dollar, but boosted oil prices. The U.S. currency lost ground against the yen and the euro while oil rose near $115 a barrel.

A weak dollar makes gold cheaper for local currency holders while rising oil prices highlights the metal's appeal as a hedge against inflation.

Traders say the focus has now shifted to Friday's U.S. jobs data, as investors are seeking more clues about the health of the U.S. economy.

Overall, analysts see the upward trend remaining intact but seasonality and technical weakness could stall gold's rally.

"There are few indications hinting that we are probably heading to a seasonal slack phase in gold," Pradeep Unni, analyst at Vision Commodities in Dubai said in a research note.

"Seasonal analysis over the last 30 years hints that from the start of the Q2 to the mid of Q3 gold usually gets coiled inside a narrow range with a bearish bias through out the period," he said.

 HDFACTBOX-U.S. Fed policymakers' recent comments   WC860 words   PD30 April 2008   ET20:44   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPCHICAGO, April 30 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers:

* Denotes 2008 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy.
   TDTEXT OF APRIL 30 FOMC STATEMENT:

"Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.

"Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.

"The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability."

* DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, APRIL 22:

"It's really a question of, are we getting the bang for the buck (from interest rate cuts). And clearly we're not. The system is sputtering. I began to feel that at 3.5 percent (federal funds rate). After that, that's when I dissented. Obviously for this next go-around, I have to watch to see if there is any change in signals.

* PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, APRIL 18:

"A slowing economy is no guarantee of slowing inflation pressures.

"The role of monetary policy is to ensure the stability of the purchasing power of the nation's currency, so that markets are not distorted by inflation. To ensure the credibility of monetary policy we should never ask monetary policy to do more than it can do.

"My concerns about inflation really tie into this notion that ... it's not these isolated price shocks, but that it's more broad-based."

BOSTON FED PRESIDENT ERIC ROSENGREN, APRIL 18:

"Financial institutions that choose not to raise capital through new equity issues or reductions in dividends are likely to react to capital losses by shrinking their balance sheets. Where and how they choose to reduce credit can have macroeconomic implications, as the availability of credit can become a factor for some subsets of borrowers."

* FED VICE-CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, APRIL 17:

Banks' wariness about lending "is reducing the values of some assets and tightening credit cost and availability across a wide range of instruments and counterparties, despite considerable easing in the stance of monetary policy.

"It is this tightening that is accentuating the downside risks for the economy as a whole."

* DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, APRIL 17:

"It's hard to rein in inflation once it's on the rise. I have maintained a strong reluctance to further general monetary accommodation ... There are ways to stabilize the economy beyond opening the monetary policy spigot."

RICHARD FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, APRIL 17:

"Inflation is a problem now. It is too high and personally I would be uncomfortable in waiting for economic slack to bring it down. I am particularly concerned about movements in measures of expected inflation.

"I am expecting a contraction in economic activity in the first half of this year. "

SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, APRIL 16:

"Economic prospects remain unusually uncertain, and the downside risks to growth are significant ... I anticipate little or no growth in the first half of this year. I'm not ruling out a recession.

"Inflation is a problem."

* FED GOVERNOR FREDERIC MISHKIN, APRIL 16:

"The stimulus package is not going to kick in for a couple of months. We're hopeful that in fact it will help the economy get through this period of slow growth. When we see what happens there, then we'll have a little bit better idea of what we might need to do in the future.

"Clearly there is some room to lower (interest rates) if it's needed."

* FED GOVERNOR KEVIN WARSH, APRIL 14:

"While the adjustment process by financial intermediaries is showing signs of promise, the healing process is not likely to be linear. Given the fragility evidenced in financial markets and the toll it is taking on real activity, the Federal Reserve agreed to take center stage."

* FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, APRIL 10:

"We do not have the luxury of waiting for markets to stabilize before we think about the future ... Indeed, many of the necessary changes that have been identified, including increased transparency, improving risk management, and attaining better coordination among regulators, could provide important support to the process of normalizing our financial markets."

 HDINSTANT VIEW 7- Federal Reserve  cuts key rate 1/4 point   WC2,305 words   PD30 April 2008   ET21:02   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve lowered a key U.S. interest rate by a modest quarter percentage point on Wednesday in what may be the last of a series of cuts aimed at aiding an economy hit hard by a housing slump and credit market turmoil.

Story: [ID:nN30513215] Text: [ID:nTRT000331] KEY POINTS: * The Fed's action takes the bellwether federal funds rate to 2 percent, the lowest since December 2004. * It was the seventh reduction in a campaign that has brought rates down by 3.25 percentage points since mid-September. * Fed says uncertainty about inflation outlook remains high. * Fed says readings on core inflation somewhat improved, but energy, commodity prices up. * Fed says expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters COMMENTS: ERIC KUBY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTH STAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORP, CHICAGO:
   TD"It seems that what people were concerned about was language that suggests this is the end of the rate cuts, and it seems as if that sort of language wasn't in the (statement).

"Everything I heard coming into today was there could be signals of a pause, and it's not seeming like that language was in there, so I think that's what people are reacting to."

"Today, you had pretty good corporate earnings going into the day, and on top of that you had Fed speak that didn't dampen the rally, so it seems to be what people hoped for." JOSEPH BALESTRINO, FIXED INCOME MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS, PITTSBURGH:

"I'm disappointed from the standpoint that I thought we would see more more language leading to a pause. They're taking a noncommittal approach as opposed to a leading approach. They have told us repeatedly that stress in the financial markets is an important variable. They fail to acknowledge today that there has been much improvement in relieving the financial stress." JOSEPH BATTIPAGLIA, MARKET STRATEGIST, STIFEL NICOLAUS, YARDLEY, PENNSYLVANIA:

"This is the second time now under Ben Bernanke's tutelage that he's expected moderating growth to give him inflation relief. He was wrong the first time, could he be wrong the second time?

"This time he's in the credit crisis... the economy's not responding to the medicine and inflation's running away from him because the dollar's getting weak and commodities are running." KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA:

"This is exactly what was anticipated in terms of them cutting by a quarter point and suggesting that they've already eased a lot and that should work to promote growth over time, and giving lip service to the potential risks for inflation as higher energy and commodity prices pass through.

"Clearly they reiterate their anticipation that inflation is going to remain low because of economic slack and weakness in the labor market. They're providing themselves some cover in signaling to the markets that they're not ignoring inflation risks as well.

"At least for the next couple of meetings they'll be on hold barring an unforeseen additional shake to the financial system. But I think ultimately when you look at the underlying strength of economic activity, or lack thereof, that they'll ultimately end up easing again either by late this year or early next year." ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, RBS GREENWICH CAPITAL, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT:

"The FOMC cut rates by 25 bps, hinted obliquely at a pause but left the door open for further rate cuts if needed. This is very much along the lines of consensus, but since this cut was only 78 pct priced in (based on Fed Fund futures), there is some prospect that the very very short-end rate reaction is bullish, and will send a minor negative signal for the USD." JAMES PLATZ, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, AMERICAN CENTURY INVESTMENTS, MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA:

"We believe and felt strongly that a 25 basis-point reduction in the target rate was warranted. We had a high confidence they would go 25 basis points and indeed will go further.

"I would not point to any specific language in the statement itself. We believe they will keep their options open as more data becomes available.

"We think the Fed will continue to cut rates because of continuing economic weakness (driven by) factors including housing and energy prices.

"We think the range of the 2-year Treasury note yield over the coming three months will be between 1.50 percent to 2.50 percent. That's a wide range because it has had an extremely volatile, extremely rapid run-up, which we believe was overdone." TU PACKARD, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA:

"The question of whether or not they will pause is really going to depend on the forthcoming data. This is a very data-driven Fed right now. It all depends on how bad things in the economy get.

"We are seeing signs that the global economy is slowing, in France, Germany, Japan, the UK, Canada, as well as in the United States. So from that viewpoint, both the Fed and the ECB have got to be worried, though it's worth saying that there's a limit to what more rate cuts will do given the nature of the crisis. I'm not sure cutting rates alone will be enough to put a floor under the U.S. housing market, for instance." BILL O'NEILL, MANAGING PARTNER, LOGIC ADVISORS, UPPER SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY:

"It's a bit supportive to gold, and I would say it's a bit supportive to commodities in general because there appeared to be a real fear this was going to be a Fed meeting that will clearly change the direction, but that did not happen."

"There was nothing definitive enough about it, and I really don't think that their comments on inflation has that much impact on gold." JIM O'SULLIVAN, ECONOMIST, UBS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT:

"They certainly tweaked it a little bit to suggest that they would like to at least pause after this meeting but not especially forcefully so there is certainly no promise.

"In the end it still comes down to the data and the markets. We still think they're not done yet and they will keep on moving at the next couple of meetings." PETER BEUTEL, PRESIDENT, CAMERON HANOVER, NEW CANAAN, CONNECTICUT:

"There had been so much hope that they would say something that would give us some sort of indication that they were done with this insanity.

"Every time they cut rates and leave the door open for another cut they basically are just giving away the store when it comes to commodity prices. I hear nothing in today's comment that they are going to do anything differently. I guess that now that we lower, there is less room to cut and ultimately they will run out of room to cut.

"They had such an opportunity to send prices tumbling.

"A lot of these higher prices from the supermarket to the pump are the Fed's handiwork." WILLIAM SULLIVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JVB FINANCIAL GROUP, BOCA RATON, FLORIDA:

"The 25 basis-points reduction to 2 percent was in line with our expectations.

"The Fed is still acknowledging that considerable stress remains in financial markets. It does not see an extensive healing process just yet in financial market conditions."

"Bonds' reaction is because the Fed is still defining the financial markets as being under considerable stress. That probably keeps alive the possibility of another rate cut in another two months. That is probably what the front end reacted to." [20080430 190208 GMT]

DANIEL NORTH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EULER HERMES ACI, OWINGS MILLS, MARYLAND:

"The take is that they have left the door for another move. I thought there would be a stronger language about they are coming to an end. They mentioned inflation more strongly.

"They are acknowledging commodity inflationary pressure. I think they are saying we are watching these commodity prices careful. They seem to be hopeful that a slowing economy will ease inflation." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY:

"Fed appears to have moved back to equal risks for inflation and growth and therefore have paused. Having said that, the substantial amount of easing to date is expected to promote moderate growth suggesting that they are a bit more constructive looking forward. They stopped that automatic easing at each meeting for sure. Are they done? Too early to tell." BILL HAMPEL, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CREDIT UNION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.:

"Couple the Fed's rate cut and the Fed's statement with this morning's GDP report and together they suggest that the Fed is done for now -- unless things get worse.

"The GDP report shows an economy stalled in a borderline mild recession and the Fed statement refers to the substantial easing of monetary policy to date. They are saying that substantial easing should help promote moderate growth. That suggests that they think they have already done a lot and that that should be enough unless things get worse." JAMES KING, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NATIONAL PENN INVESTORS, WYOMISSING, PENNSYLVANIA:

"They expressed concern about inflationary pressures. The economy and financial markets have benefiting from past cuts and other Fed initiatives to inject liquidity into the markets. So if we do start to see improved economic growth as we work through the financial debacles, we're left with an inflation problem, so they are wise to turn some attention toward that.

"The markets' behavior over the last month or two have allowed this move. The timing is right. The markets are settled so the Fed got the quarter-point rate cut in and sent a smoke signal that you don't have to look for any more rate cuts soon. The Fed will want to save its ammunition and is using this opportunity to start to shift its focus. So far the bond market is responding OK. The long bond is up modestly on the day. The long bond investors wanted to hear this from the Fed. They want to know that some attention is being paid to inflation. MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, NEW YORK:

"The forex market is looking beyond the 25 basis points cut, which was expected, and the truth is the statement does not make it clear what's the outlook for the next meeting. The Fed was somewhat more dovish this time and they can easily go both ways from here. People were expecting a clear sign that the next move would be a pause, but the statement doesn't make that clear." DAN FUSS, VICE CHAIRMAN, LOOMIS SAYLES, BOSTON:

"I don't see anything surprising in it. You could get cuts later on, but this statement does not indicate immediate further cuts. This was moderate terminology. The bond market is such a sensitive thing and it doesn't like surprises -- it likes order. So my guess here is for the time-being, the Fed waits and sees what happens. If the Fed decides to cut again, it will be telegraphed in speeches." RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO:

"It seems that the Fed gave the market no major surprises. The Fed mentioned that inflation risks remain, though they expect them to moderate. Perhaps the Fed's comments, coupled with this morning's GDP number, indicate that we may escape a recession. All of that seems to be relatively good news." STEVEN BUTLER, HEAD OF FX TRADING, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO:

"I think everyone is still trying to feel this out, but it seems a bid on the dovish side. They did say inflation is likely to moderate. I think it leaves the door open for more cuts. It's way too soon to say they are done." JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES, GALENA, ILLINOIS:

"So far, there's not much impact on the crude market. We're where we were before the decision. The important thing will be the language. They're indicating that inflation is seen moderating but that they're monitoring it closely. If they see inflation moderating, that could mean this isn't the last cut. That would be supportive for energy and other commodities as it could imply a renewed weakening in the U.S. dollar." MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO:

"The decision and the statement were very much as expected and they have moved more into data watch mode with incoming data determining policy going forward. If anything, limited impact on the dollar."

 HDUS RATE FUTURES-Data back in focus, more Fed cuts possible   BYBy Ros Krasny      WC704 words   PD30 April 2008   ET21:25   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP(Adds background, updates prices)

CHICAGO, April 30 (Reuters) - Financial dealers said the outcome of Wednesday's Federal Reserve policy meeting puts the focus on incoming economic data to show whether interest rate cuts made since September are helping the economy.
   TDMany dealers bet the Fed has not slammed the door to more interest rate reductions, even if Wednesday's cut in the fed funds rate may turn out to be the last for a while.

"I continue to think that there is scope for upcoming negative economic news to raise expectations of additional cuts as we move toward the next scheduled Fed meeting," said Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors LLC in San Francisco.

The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy panel, on Wednesday lowered the federal funds rate to 2 percent from 2.25 percent, as expected. The benchmark rate has been slashed from 5.25 percent since mid-September.

Rate futures, which measure market sentiment toward Fed policy, jumped after the FOMC meeting but still show a 76 percent chance for rates to hold steady at the June FOMC meeting versus a 24 percent chance for a cut.

"The FOMC was sounding a touch less dovish relative to the last (statement), but wording leaves the door open to more easing down the road," said Rudy Narvas, analyst at 4CAST Ltd in New York.

Prospects for a 2.25-percent funds rate by the December FOMC meeting dropped to 56 percent from 88 percent.

The Fed, in removing its more alarmist language on the economy, seems to have put its faith behind the lagged impact of its earlier rate cuts, as well as federal tax rebate checks on their way to many Americans, to shore up growth.

"There is substantial monetary easing in the pipeline, and this summer there will be a further boost from the fiscal stimulus package, cushioning the downturn," said Arun Raha, senior economist at Swiss Re in New York.

But given the weak tone to most economic releases over the past month or more, some felt the Fed's linguistic shift was misplaced, or at least premature.

"The statement reaffirms that the Fed 'will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability' but the reference to 'downside risks to growth' has gone," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

"We wonder what has happened over the past 28 days to justify these changes," he added, referring to comments made on the economy by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in early April.

Data on U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product released earlier on Wednesday showed that the economy, while not technically in a recession, is grinding along at an extremely low rate of growth. GDP expanded at a 0.6-percent annual rate for the quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2007.

The FOMC statement said that stressed financial markets, tight credit conditions and the housing contraction "are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."

The FOMC also said that while uncertainty about inflation remains high, inflation should moderate as energy and commodity prices level out and "resource utilization" eases -- a reference to the weak labor market.

Some Fed officials have said that slow growth should help tamp down price pressures, contrasting with those who see a weak economy as no guarantee of lower inflation.

In that vein, inflation hawks Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser dissented from Wednesday's decision, preferring to leave rates unchanged. For Fisher it was his third consecutive dissent; for Plosser, the second.

Fed watchers said the incoming economic data will set the central bank's agenda from this point.

Friday's April nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show a fourth consecutive month of job losses, with bearish implications for consumer confidence and retail spending.

"It's called an adverse feedback loop, and is the Fed's worst nightmare," said SCM Advisors' Bublitz. (Editing by Frank McGurty)

 HDFED FOCUS-Adjusted wording flags pause in rate cuts   BYBy Alister Bull      WC587 words   PD30 April 2008   ET22:50   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday took a page out of its 2003 playbook by tweaking the language of a policy statement to communicate a conditional halt in its campaign of interest rate cuts.

After a two-day meeting, policy-makers lowered the overnight benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 2 percent, as expected. At the same time, they emphasized the size of the total, 3.25-percentage-point reduction in the rate since September, while acknowledging the economy remains fragile.
   TDMoreover, the Fed's statement dropped a clear signal to definitely expect further rate cuts by omitting the phrase "downside risks to growth remain." The phrase was featured in its statements on March 18 and Jan. 30, when the Fed lowered rates by a cumulative 125 basis points.

That language tempered the more assertive wording of its statement on Jan. 22, when an emergency cut of 75 basis points was made and the Fed warned that "appreciable downside risks to growth remain."

On Wednesday, the central bank also reshaped the final sentence of the main body of its policy statement to restore the phrase "will act as needed." That compares with the slightly more directed "will act in a timely manner," employed since January.

The Fed introduced the earlier wording to warn markets it could move between meetings to shield the economy from the chilling impact of the housing crisis, as it did on Jan. 22.

"The Fed has shut the door on additional rate cuts, but the door remains unlocked in the event that additional financial market and credit-related events surface," said Richard Yamarone at Argus Research Corp.

Interest rate futures imply the Fed staying at 2 percent until the latter part of the year, with a modest, 24 percent likelihood, priced in to markets that it will trim another quarter percentage point at its meeting in late June.

In June 2003, when the Fed rested after a long rate-cutting campaign to 1 percent, it also jettisoned specific wording that pointed to more action.

Back then, the Fed substituted the phrase, "taken together, the balance of risks to achieving its goal is weighted toward weakness in the foreseeable future," from the previous meeting on May 6, and instead talked up the risks of inflation.

This time around the Fed also expanded its discussion of inflation, noting that while core inflation has moderated somewhat, "energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen."

It used the word "inflation" five times, the same number as its March 18 policy statement. But this time the Fed warned that "uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high."

That was a slightly more adamant construction than the wording in March that warned "uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased."

"In a silent, but very lucid manner the Fed chief and the committee have clearly acknowledged the very real issues with inflation expectations that have developed," said Joseph Brusuelas, U.S. chief economist at IDEAglobal in New York.

"The risks to the upside vis-a-vis inflation are serious enough to be on hold until the lagged impact of past Fed monetary policy and the fiscal stimulus on its way take hold," he said. (Reporting by Alister Bull; Editing by Frank McGurty)

   LPWASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he was supportive of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, adding he believes the weak U.S. economy will recover and the U.S. dollar's value will eventually reflect better long-term prospects.

"I've got confidence in the Fed and I've been very supportive of what the Fed has done and what the Fed is doing," Paulson said in an interview on Bloomberg Television after the Fed lowered its key interest rate by a quarter-percentage point to 2.0 percent.
   TD"As you've heard me say many times, I'm a strong dollar man, we have a strong dollar policy and although our economy, which has got some ups and downs, and is going through a rough patch right now, I think our long-term economic fundamentals compare very favorably when I look around the world and I think they're going to be reflected in the value of our currency," he said.

 HDRPT-GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks ease with all eyes on the Fed   BYBy Tom Miles      WC780 words   PD29 April 2008   ET07:45   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPHONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - Asian investors fine-tuned their portfolios on Tuesday ahead of a U.S. interest rate decision later this week, trimming shareholdings in trade that was made even thinner by the start of Tokyo's holiday season.

In the hesitant atmosphere, oil prices also retreated more than one dollar from Monday's record of close to $120 a barrel.
   TDInvestors are anxious to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve will draw a line under the credit crisis on Wednesday by signalling its run of rate cuts is coming to an end.

Speculation is high that it will trim its funds rate by a slim 25 basis points to 2.0 percent and signal a desire to hold rates there for the time being.

"Whenever we get a Fed meeting, it always takes a lot out of the market," said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie Equities.

"While a 25 basis point interest rate cut is widely anticipated, there are hints that this may be the last one for a while as well. People are just a little bit hesitant at the moment."

In normal times equity investors favour lower interest rates, but their precipitous decline has weakened the dollar and come to symbolise the fear of a U.S. recession, two factors that have rattled stock markets worldwide in the last six months.

With Japanese markets closed, stocks across the rest of Asia, gauged by MSCI's index, slipped 0.3 percent by 0217 GMT.

That followed a 0.16 fall in the Dow Jones industrial average percent on Monday, where the biggest U.S. takeover deal proposed this year helped offset the comments by influential investor Warren Buffett, one of the deal's backers, that the country could face a long and deep recession.

GUMMY BEAR

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will help finance Mars Inc's $23 billion offer for Wm Wrigley Jr Co, the world's largest chewing gum maker.

The offer showed signs of life in the moribund U.S. merger and acquisition market and underscored the notion that stocks are relatively cheap, That helped financial stocks overcome a report from Morgan Stanley that predicted more profit headwinds for several large U.S. banks, including Bank of America Corp

Buffett's comments on the U.S. economy revived the spectre of recession just as some investors were hoping to have seen the bottom of the market.

"This is not a field of specialty for me, but my general feeling is that the recession will be longer and deeper than most people think," Buffett told CNBC television. "This will not be short and shallow."

On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department is expected to say how fast the economy grew in the first quarter. Economists on average have projected that gross domestic product grew at an annualised 0.2 percent rate in the quarter.

The U.S. economy has had to endure ballooning raw materials costs as the weakening dollar helped boost dollar-based prices.

"I think consumers are feeling gas and food prices and not feeling they've got a lot of money for other things," Buffett said.

PAULSON REASSURES

U.S. crude oil futures hit a record high of $119.93 on Monday because of supply worries caused by attacks in Nigeria and the closure of a British oil pipeline following a refinery strike. The price had trickled back to $118.53 by 0211 GMT on Tuesday.

The strike at Scotland's Grangemouth refinery is expected to end on Tuesday, allowing the refinery and pipeline to reopen, the refinery owner Ineos has said.

The high cost of fuel has also troubled airlines such as Korean Air Co, the world's top cargo carrier, which slid 4.4 percent.

"If oil prices remain high, the company's earnings are seen hurt for a long time," said Baik Ji-ae, an analyst at Tongyang Investment Bank.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Monday that the economy was facing "headwinds" in the form of rising oil prices and commodity costs, but insisted its long-term economic fundamentals remained sound.

"I think there's a concern that supply is tight, could get tighter and there's a potential for disruption down the road," he said.

He denied that there was any sign of 1970s-type "stagflation" threatening the economy, in which growth slows and prices shoot up simultaneously.

"We are seeing nothing like that today," he said, "Core inflation is well contained."

 HDFed cuts key  interest rate  by 1/4 point   BYBy Mark Felsenthal      WC440 words   PD30 April 2008   ET20:15   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve lowered a key U.S. interest rate by a modest quarter percentage point on Wednesday in what may be the last of a series of cuts aimed at aiding an economy hit hard by a housing slump and credit market turmoil.

The Fed's action takes the bellwether federal funds rate to 2 percent, the lowest since December 2004. It was the seventh reduction in a campaign that has brought rates down by 3.25 percentage points since mid-September.
   TDPresident George W. Bush on Tuesday said the U.S. economy faced a "tough time," a point underscored on Wednesday by a report that showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a slim 0.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter.

While the growth rate was a bit stronger than economists had expected, it reflected a buildup in inventories that may weigh on the economy in coming months.

Other details in the report were decidedly weak.

Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. output, grew at the slowest pace since 2001, business investment fell and homebuilding continued to nosedive, recording the biggest drop in 26 years.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on April 2 that "recession is possible," adding that the Fed believed there might be a "slight contraction" in the economy in the first six months of the year.

At the same time, with gasoline prices heading toward $4 dollars a gallon and strong global demand pushing up food prices, some Fed officials have worried that a desire to bolster the economy could divert the central bank's attention from inflation pressures.

In addition to rate cuts, the Fed has taken a number of emergency steps to ease credit strains that have threatened to make the economy's ills worse, pumping billions of dollars into markets to keep them from choking on mortgage-related bets.

At their meeting on Wednesday, Fed officials discussed a new measure -- paying interest on commercial bank reserves held at the central bank -- that could improve their ability to provide liquid funds to the market.

The Fed has also mulled whether expanding the size of its term auction facility cash auctions for banks and extending the duration of those loans beyond 28 days could help ease still-tight credit conditions. (Additional reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Tim Ahmann)

 HDFed cuts key rate by quarter-point, says the US economy remains weak   BYBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER      CRAP Economics Writer   WC698 words   PD30 April 2008   ET21:36   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a quarter-point Wednesday, a smaller move than the aggressive easing it undertook earlier this year. There were signs the Fed may believe it has done enough to prevent a deep recession.

The Fed action, after a two-day meeting, pushed the federal funds rate down to 2 percent, the lowest level since late 2004. It marked the seventh rate cut by the central bank since it began easing credit conditions last September to combat the growing threat of a recession brought on by a severe housing slump and credit crisis.
   TDCommercial banks immediately announced that they were cutting their prime lending rate to 5 percent. That will mean cheaper credit for the millions of business and consumer loans tied to the prime.

The Fed move, which was in line with expectations, sent the Dow Jones industrial average momentarily soaring above 13,000 for the first time since January. But the Dow quickly gave up those gains as traders began to wonder whether the Fed was closing the door to further rate cuts.

Many private economists said they believed a Fed statement was signaling that the central bank may be through cutting rates unless the economy weakens much more than now expected.

"They are saying that unless we are surprised by further weakness, this is it," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.

Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, said, "The Fed is telling us that this easing cycle is coming to an end fairly soon."

Analysts said the central bank seemed to be balanced between worries about economic weakness and concerns that inflation pressures are increasing. The Fed noted that it had done quite a bit already.

"The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity," Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues said in their statement.

There were two dissents from the move. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas regional Fed bank, and Charles Plosser, head of the Philadelphia Fed, argued for no change in rates. Both officials had also dissented at the March 18 meeting when the Fed cut rates by three-fourths point.

The central bank is walking a tightrope, trying to jump-start economic growth while also confronting the risk that if it overdoes the credit easing it could make inflation worse down the road.

Many economists believe the country has fallen into a recession. However, the government reported Wednesday that the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, managed to eke out a 0.6 percent growth rate in the January-March quarter, barely in positive territory.

On the overall economy, the Fed's statement said, "Financial markets remain under considerable stress and tight credit conditions and deepening housing contractions are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."

While officials said they expected inflation to moderate in coming months, they also said "uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high."

The quarter-point move followed a string of more aggressive rate cuts ranging from a half-point to three-fourths-point in the first three months of this year as the central bank was battling to stabilize financial markets roiled by multibillion-dollar losses caused by rising mortgage defaults.

That turmoil claimed its biggest victim on March 16 when Bear Stearns came to the brink of bankruptcy and the Fed stepped forward with a $30 billion (euro19.3 billion) line of credit to facilitate a sale of the nation's fifth largest investment bank to JP Morgan Chase.

Credit markets, while not back to normal, have stabilized and many analysts believe the worst may be over -- although they caution that this forecast could prove too optimistic if the housing slump deepens, causing even more mortgage defaults than now expected.

Before the Fed made its first rate cut in September, the funds rate had stood at 5.25 percent.

 HDUS dollar falls slightly after Fed cuts key  interest rate    BYBy ERIN CONROY      CRAP Business Writer   WC416 words   PD30 April 2008   ET22:42   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPNEW YORK (AP) - The dollar slipped Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced it cut a key interest rate by a quarter-point, a move that investors had anticipated.

Markets had also expected the Fed to signal a pause in its rate-cutting campaign to combat the growing threat of a recession -- something Wednesday's statement did not clearly indicate.
   TDThe 15-nation euro rose to $1.5642 in late New York trading, from $1.5564 late Tuesday. The British pound climbed to $1.9893 from $1.9681, while the dollar was unchanged at 104.17 Japanese yen.

The Fed's action pushed the federal funds rate down to 2 percent, its lowest level since late 2004. It marked the seventh consecutive rate cut by the central bank since it began easing credit conditions in September, when the funds rate had stood at 5.25 percent.

Though lower interest rates can spur a nation's economy, they can weigh on its currency as traders transfer funds to countries where they can earn higher returns.

"The markets were expecting this, so while the dollar has weakened it's been nothing earth shaking," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. "There's some evidence that markets have been second-guessing the Fed, as they delay dollar-selling."

Also Wednesday, the government reported that the overall economy managed a 0.6 percent growth rate in the January-March quarter, barely in positive territory.

Meanwhile, a report out of Europe showed that yearly inflation in the 15 nations that use the euro cooled in April, as economic confidence sank to a 2 1/2-year low. European Union officials have said that high energy and food prices have pushed Europe into "inflationary shock."

Unlike the Fed and the Bank of England, the European Central Bank has not moved rates since last June despite a financial crisis that made banks reluctant to lend. Easing inflation and signs of slower growth strengthen the case to leave the current rate of 4 percent unchanged.

"The numbers out of Europe were not a huge surprise but still were very elevated, and I doubt policymakers took a lot of comfort in the inflation numbers," Gilmore said.

In other late New York trading, the dollar eased to 1.0338 Swiss francs from 1.0382 francs, and fell to 1.0046 Canadian dollars from 1.0122.

   LPHONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - Asian bonds were slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of an expected rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, but the optimism was offset by a view the U.S. central bank could signal an end to the current easing cycle.

Activity was also spurred by two major U.S. corporate deals and a continued revival in U.S. primary markets which signalled a pick-up in risk appetite.
   TDThe iTRAXX Asia ex-Japan high-yield index <ITAHY5UA=ITX>, a key measure of risk aversion, moved in to 423/428 basis points from Monday's close of 435/441 bps.

"Equity markets continue to stabilise, we have seen some real money accounts buying. Some of them are coming back trying to pick up beaten down bonds," said a Hong Kong based trader.

Overnight in the United States, Mars Inc, the maker of M&Ms candy, offered to buy Wm Wrigley Jr Co , the world's largest chewing gum maker and Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp said it intends to make a cash tender offer for up to 20 million shares of Ford Motor Co. .

Also on Monday, Bristol-Myers Squibb brought a $600 million bond deal to the market and a finance unit of Ford Motor Co sold $1.1 billion in debt.

"M&A activity is growing in the U.S., the high-yield market is also picking up. All this put together shows a better risk environment," said Dilip Parameswaran, credit analyst with Calyon Corporate & Investment Bank.

While these deals higlighted the fact that U.S. stock valuations are at their lowest in over a decade and debt issuers are taking advantage of tighter credit spreads, eyes are now on U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.

It is expected the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday but there is also a growing view the central bank will hold rates steady after that reduction amid concerns about inflation.

"A small deficit or surplus will not have a significant impact. The market is already expecting this," a Manila-based trader said, adding that bond prices already reflected this expectation.

Philippine 2031 bonds <PHIGLB31=RR> were a quarter point higher at 112.75/113.25 cents to a dollar.

Its 5-year credit default swaps <PHILP5UA=GFI> -- insurance-like contracts that protect against defaults and restructuring -- moved in to 179/184 bps from 184/189 bps.

And while comments from legendary investor Warren Buffett reignited fears the U.S. economy could see a longer and deeper recession, concerns around the credit markets are still clouding the outlook.

"The monoline issue has been relegated to the background, but recently AMBAC's results were worse than expected; the monoline issue may yet come back," said Parameswaran referring to bond insurer's $1.66 billion first quarter loss.

 HDU.S. Fed seen set to lower rates, may signal pause   BYBy Mark Felsenthal      WC592 words   PD30 April 2008   ET06:01   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPWASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a modest quarter percentage point on Wednesday and may suggest the rate-cutting cycle it kicked off last fall has reached an end.

The Fed will announce its decision on rates and offer an assessment of threats facing the economy at around 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT).
   TD"The statement ... will make it clear that the net risk to growth is still to the downside, but that the risks have been reduced by the Fed's actions," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

The central bank's decision may be shaped in part by a government report on U.S. gross domestic product due just hours earlier. Analysts expect the report to show the economy expanded at a miserly 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter.

Fed policy-makers, who opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday, confront a bleak landscape with an economy moving sideways at best, elevated prices for food and fuel, a deep housing downturn and lingering malaise in financial markets.

The Fed has cut benchmark overnight rates to 2.25 percent from 5.25 percent since mid-September.

Of 20 primary dealers participating in a Reuters poll last week, all 20 said the Fed would cut its fed funds rate target for overnight bank loans by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday.

While a further quarter point reduction is widely expected, interest rate futures prices imply a small probability that rates will be held steady.

In addition to lowering rates to spur the economy, the central bank has rolled out a series of emergency steps to pump billions of dollars of liquidity into financial markets to beat back a credit crunch. Policy-makers also will debate a new liquidity tool -- paying interest on bank reserves -- on Wednesday.

Fresh evidence of clouds over the economy emerged on Tuesday, with reports showing consumer confidence at a five-year low this month, a continued slide in existing home prices in February and a 23 percent surge in foreclosures in the first quarter.

At the same time, with gasoline prices heading toward $4 a gallon and strong global demand pushing up food prices, some Fed officials have worried openly that a desire to support the economy could lead the central bank to take its eyes off inflation.

Two officials dissented from the central bank's decision in March to cut rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, preferring a less aggressive move.

The Fed's rate cuts have led to a weakening in the U.S. dollar that has pushed import prices higher, adding to inflation pressures. But Fed officials believe unemployment is likely to climb amid the economy's weakness, making it difficult for businesses to raise their prices.

Policy-makers also expect the combined effects of the central bank's rate cuts -- which act with a lag -- and a $152 billion fiscal stimulus package will provide a boost to the economy in months to come.

"The disinflationary effect of a weak domestic economy and rising slack will ultimately dominate the inflation boosting impact of higher commodity prices and dollar depreciation," UBS economist James O'Sullivan wrote earlier this week in a note to clients. (Editing by Carol Bishopric)

   LPNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key interest rate at 2 percent if the U.S. central bank's outlook on the economy does not deteriorate even further, the co-chief of the world's largest bond fund company said on Wednesday.

Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees $750 billion in assets, said the Fed is "basically telling you that unless their outlook for the real economy deteriorates further, they will stay at 2 percent."
   TD"If the Fed was just focusing on the financial system, they would not ease more -- they would use these other measures to provide liquidity directly to the market," El-Erian said in a telephone interview from his headquarters in Newport Beach, California.

"They will only go further if economic activity weakens because they remain worried about inflation and they have other instruments to foster market liquidity." (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan and John Parry in New York)

 HDASSET-BACKEDS-ABX "AAAs" higher, Fed cuts key rates   BYBy Nancy Leinfuss      WC489 words   PD30 April 2008   ET23:16   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LPNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - A key derivatives index ended higher in better trading volume on Wednesday as the U.S. Federal Reserve wrapped up its two-day policy-setting meeting with a quarter-point cut to key interest rates.

The Fed lowered its fed funds and discount rates by one-quarter point in what may be the last in a series of cuts aimed at aiding an economy hurt by a housing slump and credit market turmoil.
   TD"AAA" layers of the ABX, a synthetic index of home equity ABS securities tied to credit default swaps, ended over 1 point higher on Wednesday, with several indexes reaching levels not seen since early February, traders said.

"ABX was very well bid this morning. People have been chasing the offered side of the market," said Michael Boyle,director of ABX trading, at UBS Securities.

Among the indexes to post the strongest gains in Wednesday's session were the ABX 06-1 "AAA" index, which traded as high as 95 on Wednesday, a level not seen since early February, before ending at 94.50, traders said.

The ABX 06-2 "AAA" index traded as high as 84, also a level not seen since early February. But the index later eased to 83, ending 2 points higher than its previous close, traders said.

In the secondary cash market, trading activity was muted by the absence of bid lists in the market; however, market participants said the tone has improved recently.

"On the cash side, the tone has been better over recent weeks. For shorter duration cash flows, the trend has been exceptionally positive," Boyle said.

Spreads on non-mortgage ABS, such as credit card and autos, narrowed by 5 to 10 basis points in the month of April.

"The tone has been pretty positive across structured products. There's been demand for the upper tiers of the credit spectrum in ABS for the sectors deemed the safest," said Derrick Wulf, portfolio manager at Dwight Asset Managment.

"People have been looking at those sectors that withstood the credit crisis better. There are some good relative value opportunities out there," said Wulf, who noted that credit cards and auto ABS spreads have recently narrowed while CMBS spreads have come in more significantly.

Wulf said the Fed's latest interest-rate cut did not have much of an impact on the ABS market as key upcoming employment data due out on Friday will have.

"The bigger impact on ABS will be from the Labor report. Over the short-term, people are more focused on the health of the consumer than the Fed's move," Wulf said. "If Friday's data shows the weakness is accelerating, that does not bode well for consumer-related ABS," he said. (Editing by Jan Paschal )

 HDASSET-BACKEDS-Capital One prices as ABS tone improves   BYBy Nancy Leinfuss      WC500 words   PD29 April 2008   ET22:35   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - The credit card segment led issuance in the U.S. asset-backed securities market on Tuesday, as interest in secondary non-mortgage ABS issues picked up and ABX trading waned.
   TDCapital One Financial  sold a larger than expected $725 million credit card ABS offering on Tuesday into strong investor demand. The firm's "AAA" two-year notes, initially expected to come at a size of $550 million, priced at 130 basis points over one-month Libor, market sources said.

 Non-mortgage ABS sales have fared well over recent months with the credit card segment comprising 50 percent of the $60 billion in sales sold year-to-date.

 Still, overall ABS supply has tumbled from the $248 billion sold during the same time period last year. Home equity ABS, also known as subprime mortgage, led the substantial decline in volume this year as investors fled the risky securities.

 In the secondary cash market, trading activity picked up along top-rated non-mortgage ABS segments, specifically credit cards and autos, traders said.

 "There's a much different tone on the cash side of the market. Spreads are a bit tighter now," said one ABS trader.

 "In the middle of March the market was pricing in the probablility of a great catostrophic financial failure but because that didn't happen people are now willing to take the tail risks out of pricing assumptions," the trader added.

 Short-dated prime auto and credit card "AAA" spreads have narrowed by five to 10 basis points so far in April, as investor buying interest re-emerged, traders said.

 In the derivatives market, top segments of the ABX, a synthetic index of home equity ABS securities tied to credit default swaps, ended little-changed in thin volume on Tuesday.

 "There's very little liquidity in ABX. The lack of investor interest is making things very choppy," said one ABX trader.

 Looking ahead, the U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off a two-day meeting on Tuesday, that is expected to end with a small interest rate cut. A decision on rates is expected to be announced about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday.

 The Fed has lowered the Fed funds rate to 2.25 percent from 5.25 percent in six steps since mid-September, amid ongoing credit strains and no signs the housing market has hit bottom.

 In a sign of further distress, real estate firm RealtyTrac said on Tuesday that U.S. home foreclosure filings jumped 23 percent in the first quarter from 2007's fourth quarter. Foreclosures more than doubled from the same year-ago period.

 "The health of the U.S. consumer and the ABS market will be determined in large part by the labor market. If consumers have jobs, then they can most likely pay their obligations," said Glenn Schultz, analyst at Wachovia Securities.  (Editing by   )

 HDQatar cbank says could raise lending rate in future   WC159 words   PD1 May 2008   ET10:04   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited   
   LP DUBAI, May 1 (Reuters) - Qatar, which reduced its deposit rate on Thursday to match a U.S. interest rate cut a day earlier, said it could raise its benchmark lending rate and repurchase rate in the future.

 The world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas has kept its lending facility and repo rates steady at 5.5 percent and 5.55 percent, respectively, following seven rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve since Sept. 18.
   TD The rates were kept unchanged on Thursday after the latest Fed move, "with the possibility of raising them in the future", the Qatar Central Bank said in a statement.

 This is the first time in the current wave of Fed cuts that the Qatar central bank has indicated its future intentions.

 HDUPDATE 1-Dollar Libor falls again, spreads tighten pre-Fed   BYBy Emelia Sithole-Matarise      WC497 words   PD30 April 2008   ET14:20   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited

LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - The interbank cost of borrowing three-month dollars fell again on Wednesday and spreads over secured lending narrowed ahead of an expected U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut which could be the last in an aggressive easing campaign.
   TDMarkets widely expect the Fed to cut its benchmark overnight lending target by 25 basis points to 2 percent <FEDWATCH> at the end of its two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday.

But with inflation pressures growing, the post-meeting statement is expected to answer the ultimate question of whether the central bank is done with an easing campaign that has slashed rates three percentage points since September amid credit market turmoil.

London interbank offered rates for sterling also fell but euro Libor remained sticky, nudging up and spreads widening, the British Bankers Association's latest daily fixing showed.

"We want to see what the Fed does today, whether they take a more dovish tone or whether they take a more hawkish tone. In general I think that the problems in the financial sector will persist," said David Ging, interest rate strategist Credit Suisse in London.

"There's some evidence if you look at sterling and dollar over the last several days there seems to be a little bit of stability but I think the long-term prospects and the problems 


in the global financial system -- and the money market in
particular -- are going to be around for a while. There's no


easy solutions," he said.

Three-month dollar Libor <USD3MFSR=> fell more than two basis points to 2.85 percent, and the spread over Overnight Index Swaps narrowed almost three basis points to 82.50000 basis points. Sterling also fell though the spread over OIS widened slightly.

In contrast, three-month euro Libor remained elevated, with the spread over OIS widening more than one basis point to 82.66300, reflecting continuing strain in the system. For more on the BBA's latest daily fixing, see [ID:nL30935081].

"While it is legitimate to argue that there have been signs of improvement in U.S. and UK based measures of stress, that does not appear to be translating into an improvement in money market conditions. Eurozone indicators, meanwhile, continue to deteriorate," BNP Paribas strategists said in a note.

Earlier, the Euribor rate for three-month unsecured lending in euros between European banks remained was unchanged at 4.857 percent, its highest since Dec. 18 despite efforts by the European Central Bank to reduce money market tensions.

"Today's regular month-end almost feels like a regular year-end at the very short end where overnight rates should rise further today despite a generous liquidity endowment by the ECB," noted Dresdner Kleinwort. (Reporting by Emelia Sithole-Matarise; Editing by Ron Askew)

 HDUS RATE FUTURES-Still look for Fed cut after GDP data   BYBy Ros Krasny      WC331 words   PD30 April 2008   ET14:41   SNReuters News   SCLBA   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008 Reuters Limited

CHICAGO, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. short-term interest rate futures held steady after first-quarter economic growth came in slightly stronger than expected, confounding ideas that the economy had slipped into recession early this year.
   TDFutures continue to imply an 80 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points following its policy-setting meeting on Wednesday.

"There is nothing here that would dissuade the Fed from both cutting rates by 25 basis points today and sending out a pause signal for the moment," Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, said of the GDP report.

The two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting will wrap up around 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT).

U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 0.6-percent annual rate in the first quarter, similar to the final quarter of 2007 and above the median forecast of 0.2 percent.

"The components show a 1.0 percent rise in consumption, a 4.7 percent drop in investment and a 2.0 percent rise in government spending," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

"Overall, soft and softening, with worse to come in the wake of the collapse in consumer confidence," he said.

Fed officials have said recently that growth is weak, and that an official ruling on whether or not the United States plunges into recession is largely a semantic issue.

A 25 basis point cut would take the federal funds rate to 2 percent from a peak of 5.25 percent in mid-September.

Futures values suggest the Fed will hold rates steady at its next few meetings and possibly start raising rates again by year-end.

   LPNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. copper futures closed higher on Wednesday, then climbed further in after-hours trade as investors bought the red metal following a Federal Reserve interest rate cut and a statement that traders said left open the possibility the Fed would loosen credit further.

Continued work stoppages at three of Chilean miner Codelco's copper mines kept support under prices all day.
   TDNOTE: For detailed report, click on [MET/L].

* Newly active July copper <HGK8> stood 2.35 cents higher at $3.9045 per lb by the close on the COMEX metals division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Wednesday's range spanned $3.8455 to $3.9270.

* In after hours electronic trade, July copper shot up to a session high at $3.9270 a lb, but then steadied around $3.9135.

* COMEX estimated final copper volume at 11,956 lots. Tuesday's final tally came to 17,836 lots.

* Open interest for copper futures fell 1,097 lots to 104,206 by the close of April 29.

* On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months <MCU3> finished slightly higher at $8,549 per tonne from Tuesday's $8,540 a tonne finish.

* The U.S. central bank policy-setting committee trimmed 1/4 point off its target for the overnight fed funds rate to 2.00 percent. [nTRT000331]

* The Fed's statement was seen by many analysts as leaving room to cut U.S. interest rates further by saying it will continue to monitor economic and financial developments, and act as needed to promote growth.

* The prospect of further U.S. rate cuts undermined the dollar, which erased earlier gains against the euro. Dollar traders were expecting a clear sign that the next move would be a pause for the Fed and their statement did not suggest that. [nN30530260]

* A falling dollar makes dollar-denominated assets like copper more attractive to overseas investors.

* "Fundamentally," said Matthew Zeman, head of trading with LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago, "it looks good to go higher. Copper's a market that is always vulnerable to supply disruptions. A lot of people were looking for the dollar to rally if the Fed signaled it was finished easing. And it didn't. The dollar actually sold off a bit, and I think that's why we saw a pop in the metal."

* Copper gained early after reports showed U.S. gross domestic product grew by 0.6 percent in the first quarter, a slightly stronger pace than the 0.2 percent forecast by economists. [nN29322975]

* Offering a more positive view of the economy, U.S. private-sector employers added 10,000 jobs in April according to a private report by ADP Employer Services. [nWEN5339]

* Copper seemed to shrug off a contraction in U.S. Midwest business activity in April for a third straight month. The Chicago Purchasing Management Index was, however, slightly less weak than expected and higher then the last two readings. [nNAT003979]

* Analysts said the regional monitor showed more continued weakness in the manufacturing sector, but noted that the new orders index in the report remain strong. [nN30504879]

* Continuing strikes at three of Chilean copper giant Codelco's mines kept copper prices supported. Production at Teniente, the world's largest underground copper mine, remained halted for the second day. Work strikes have shuttered smaller Andina and Salvador divisions for 15 days. [nN30432024]

 HDJapanese shares fall after US rate cut   WC308 words   PD1 May 2008   ET11:11   SNAssociated Press Newswires   SCAPRS   LAEnglish   CY(c) 2008.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   
   LPTOKYO (AP) - Japanese shares fell Thursday as investors sold banking stocks after the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts its key interest rate.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average index shed 83.13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 13,766.86.
   TD"Banks had posted strong gains in the run-up to the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting. But once the meeting was over, they took a pause," said Masayoshi Okamoto, general manager at Jujiya Securities.

The U.S. central bank, as expected, cut its key federal funds rate by a quarter-point Wednesday, a smaller move than the aggressive easing it undertook earlier this year. The Fed action pushed the rate down to 2 percent, the lowest level since late 2004. It was the seventh rate cut by the bank since it began easing credit conditions last September to combat the threat of a recession brought on by the housing slump and credit crisis.

Sentiment was also sluggish after Japan's central bank said in a report Wednesday the world's second largest economy was slowing, with "downside risks" in the U.S. economy a potential threat to Japan.

The Topix index of all the Tokyo Stock Exchange First Section issues declined 12.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,346.10.

Shares in banking giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial fell 3.8 percent to 1,101 yen. Mizuho Financial dropped 5 percent to 513,000 yen.

Real estate giant Mitsubishi Estate lost 5.1 percent to 2,865 yen, and Sumitomo Realty & Development fell 3.7 percent to 2,505 yen.

In currencies, the dollar was quoted at 103.72 yen midafternoon in Tokyo trade, down from 104.17 yen late Wednesday in New York. The euro was quoted at $1.5634, down from $1.5642.

Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America said its prime rate is now 5.00 percent, down from 5.25 percent. The Fed cut the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 2 percent from 2.25 percent previously.
   TDThe prime rate is what banks charge their best customers, and serves as the benchmark for lending rates to all customers for mortgages, credit cards and other products.

Most banks typically raise or lower their prime rate by an amount equal to the Fed's rate action within minutes of its decision.

   LPNEW YORK (AP) - Emerging markets ADRs rose Wednesday afternoon after the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered a key interest rate in a move to jumpstart the beleaguered U.S. economy.

The Fed voted to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 2 percent, and the discount rate by one-quarter of a percent to 2.5 percent.
   TDThe Bank of New York Emerging Markets ADR Index -- which includes shares of companies based in China, Mexico, Brazil and more -- gained 4.98 points to 366.42. Before the cut, the index was up about 4.3 points.

ADR stands for American Depositary Receipt, which is a security designed to allow U.S. investors to trade shares of companies based overseas.

South Korea's Kookmin Bank shares rose $2.07, or 3 percent, to $70.14. Before the news, the ADR was up about 2.2 percent.

Shares of Brazil's Perdigao SA, a food producer, gained $4.87, or 10 percent, to $54.89. The stock had jumped about 6 percent before the Fed's action.

Shares of homebuilder Homex Development Corp. shed 47 cents to $60.43, and were down less than a percent before the cut.

Shares of Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned oil giant, added $3.33, or 2.9 percent, to $120.28. The company, which recently discovered large oil reserves off its coast, was trading down less than 1 percent earlier in the session.

Shares of Chinese Internet portal Baidu.com Inc. lost $4.21 to $369.54. Its stock had oscillated between gains and losses earlier in the day.

The Bank of New York Composite ADR Index gained 2.14 points to 182.38 as the U.S. markets rallied in the afternoon session.
