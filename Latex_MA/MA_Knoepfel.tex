\chapter{Monetary Policy and Interest Rates} \label{MonetaryPolicy}
 
\noindent However little understood, the relationship between monetary policy and market interest rates is undeniable. Interest rates of all maturities react to changes in monetary policy, creating opportunities and risks for traders, challenges for policy makers, and puzzling effects for academics to study (\citealt[p. 1594]{Ellingsen.2001}). 

Target rate changes in particular have an impact on the bond market and on interest rates (\citealt[p. 332]{Cook.1989}). %Overall, there is an invested interest in how monetary policy impacts yield curve movement.
Yet, the understanding of yield curve movements is incomplete at best. On average, the relationship between monetary policy and interest rates appears to be positive: An increase in the central bank's target rate leads to an increase in the interest rates of all maturities. However, there are many instances where this simple rule has proven false and interest rates of long maturities fell in response to an increase in the central bank's rate \citep[p. 1594]{Ellingsen.2001}. 

Chapter \ref{SensitivityPuzzle} gives an account of the puzzle posed by the inconsistent response of long-term rates, Chapter \ref{ExistingResearch} touches on previous research on the topic, and Chapter  \ref{NewInsights} outlines how an investigation of narratives might be able to shed light on this puzzle.




\section{Excess Sensitivity Puzzle} \label{SensitivityPuzzle}

\cite{Cook.1989} analyzed financial data from the late 70s and found that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), by setting the target for the federal funds rate, had a strong influence on interest rate movements. While short-term rates reacted particularly strongly, changes in the target rate also caused small but significant movements in long-term rates. 
%According to \citeauthor{Cook.1989}, the positive relationship between the funds rate and market interest rates is evidence in favor of the expectation theory of the term structure of interest rates. They are convinced, that ***explain this and then contrast*** // 

 
It is not surprising that short-term rates follow the target rate closely, after all the Fed keeps the overnight rate close to the target and thus directly influences the one-month rate \citep[p. 1]{Ellingsen.2003}. The movements of the long-term rates are more ambiguous. \citet[p. 343--346]{Cook.1989} interpret the fact that, on average, 10-year and 30-year bonds co-move with the short-term rates as evidence for the expectation theory of the term structure of interest rates. According to the expectation theory, long-term rates are equal to short-term rates over the same period of time plus a term premium. Thus, an increase in the short-term rates is expected to drive up long-term rates as well, but to a lesser extent \citep[p. 1594]{Ellingsen.2001}.


%In theory, the effect of a target rate change could be offset by an adjustment of inflation expectations, pushing long-term rates in the opposite direction \citep{Ellingsen.2003}. Yet, \cite{Cook.1989} found clear evidence that, on average, even 10-year and 30-year bonds co-move with the target rate and the short-term rates. 

To \cite{Romer.2000}, on the other hand, the response of long-term rates presents a puzzle. They argue that standard theory predicts a drop in inflation as short-term rates rise, which ought to lead to a reduction in long-term rates. The opposite can be observed, however: Interest rates for all maturities typically rise following an increase in the target rate. \cite{Romer.2000} explain this anomaly with information-asymmetry between the Fed and the general public. They find evidence that the Fed is in possession of private information, which it reveals to other market participants through its monetary policy. In response, market participants adjust their inflation expectations upwards, causing long-term rates to rise.


%Yet, \cite{Cook.1989} found clear evidence that, on average, even 10-year and 30-year bonds co-move with the target rate and the short-term rates. 
%interpret their finding as supportive of the expectations theory of the term structure.2 The expectations theory says that a long interest rate should be equal to the average of short interest rates over the same period of time plus a term premium; thus an increase in the first couple of short rates should drive up the long rate too, but by less.


Dissecting the interest rate response in more detail led Skinner and Zettelmeyer (1995) to paint an even complexer picture. While the yield curve shifts upwards on average, they found a number of occasions where an adjustment to the target rate caused the yield curve to tilt: Long and short rates responded by moving in opposite directions (as cited in \citealt[p. 1]{Ellingsen.2003}). Skinner and Zettelmeyer came to the conclusion that these were not singular occurrences, but that such tilts made up a considerable portion of the yield curve responses and could be observed in all four of the big economies they studied, that is in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States (as cited in \citealt[p. 1594]{Ellingsen.2001}). An example is the yield curve movement in 1994, where interest rates of long maturities fell after the Fed announced an increase in its target rate \citep[~p. 1594]{Ellingsen.2001}. So not only is the positive response of long-term rates difficult to explain, the response is not even consistent in its direction: long-term rates may move up or down when the Fed increases the target rate. 

Whether positive or negative, to \citet[p. 425]{Gurkaynak.2005} any response of long-term rates is in contradiction to standard macroeconomic models. They argue that models predict that short-term rates return quickly to their steady state and thus have only a transitory effect on the future path of interest rates. Therefore, one would expect long-term rates not to react to monetary policy changes. They refer to the fact that long-term rates move significantly in response to monetary policy decisions as \textit{excess sensitivity} of long-term interest rates \cite[p. 2]{Gurkaynak.2003}.


\citet[p. 426--427]{Gurkaynak.2005} focus on the response of \textit{forward} interest rates as a different way of expressing the yield curve. They find that long-term forward rates move in the opposite direction to the monetary policy actions. As they note, this stands in sharp contrast to the findings of \cite{Cook.1989} and \cite{Romer.2000}, who observed a co-movement of long-term rates. \citeauthor{Gurkaynak.2005} put this down to their use of forward rates, which they consider a better measure for sensitivity. %instead of long-term yields. 
Additionally, they criticize previous research for the usage of raw change in the target rate, neglecting to differentiate between expected and unexpected policy moves. In their opinion, only the unexpected components of a monetary policy action can be expected to influence the term structure \citep[p. 430--431]{Gurkaynak.2005}.

Since \citeauthor{Gurkaynak.2005} observe a negative response of the long-term forward rates, they suggest that such a response is not an anomaly but has a very natural explanation. 
Standard macroeconomic models assume that long-run levels of inflations and real interest rates are relatively fixed and known by all market participants \citep[p. 425]{Gurkaynak.2005}. \citeauthor{Gurkaynak.2005} argue that models might be misspecified and long-run inflation expectations are not as perfectly anchored as assumed. They see the most plausible explanation for the observed term structure movements in the fact that monetary policy surprises lead market participants to adjust their expectations of the long-run level of inflation \citep[p. 434--435]{Gurkaynak.2005}.


%\cite[p. 27]{Gurkaynak.2003} explain the negative response of the forward rate with the fact that the private sector needs to adjust its expectation of long-run level of inflation in response to monetary policy surprises. Thus, observed term structure movements go against model predictions because models assume that long-run levels of inflations and real interest rates are known by all market participants. \cite[p. 2]{Gurkaynak.2003}  If these assumptions prove false and market participants need to adjust expectations in response to unanticipated monetary policy actions, long-term rates can be expected to move downwards. 

 
Even though \cite{Gurkaynak.2005} are able to account for the negative response of long-term forward rates to an increase in the target rate, \citet[p. 2]{Ellingsen.2004} maintain that their model is unable to explain the positive response of long-term yields observed by other researchers. Thus, \cite{Gurkaynak.2005} fail to solve the puzzle as to why the yield curve shifts on one occasion but tilts at another when provoked by apparently identical monetary policy actions. \citeauthor{Ellingsen.2003} address this shortcoming in their own model (\citeyear{Ellingsen.2001}) and provide empirical support for their hypotheses (\citeyear{Ellingsen.2003}).

%This strong response of long-term interest rates to monetary policy innovations is typically difficult to replicate using standard macro models (see also G¨urkaynak et al., 2003).

%Interest rate sensitivity is a measure of how much the price of a fixed-income asset will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. Securities that are more sensitive have greater price fluctuations than those with less sensitivity. This type of sensitivity must be taken into account when selecting a bond or other fixed-income instrument the investor may sell in the secondary market
%
%Generally, the longer the maturity of the asset, the more sensitive the asset to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates are watched closely by bond and fixed-income traders, as the resulting price fluctuations affect the overall yield of the securities. Investors who understand the concept of duration can immunize their fixed-income portfolios to changes in short-term interest rates.


\section{Existing Research} \label{ExistingResearch}

E2001 is a narrative approach

\begin{quote}It has often been noted that the response of long-term interest rates to monetary policy innovations differs from occasion to occasion: sometimes long rates move in the same direction as the policy innovation, sometimes they move in the opposite direction. Most models of monetary policy cannot account for this puzzling behavior of long-term interest rates. In our previous work, we have shown that such a behavior is easily explained in a model where the central bank has private information about economic shocks and its own preferences or targets.~\cite{Ellingsen.2004}\end{quote}
%
\begin{quote}(2001) find that the yield curve response to monetary policy innovations depends crucially on the interpretation of bond market participants of the reasons behind the policy move.
	
	The intuition behind these results is straightforward. When supply or demand shocks cannot be directly observed, any unanticipated increase in the central bank’s policy rate is interpreted as a response to an unobserved inflationary shock. As the central bank is expected to counteract this inflationary impulse by tightening policy for some time, interest rates of all maturities increase as market participants update their expectations of the future path of the short rate. If, on the other hand, shocks are observable, but central bank preferences or objectives are not, an unanticipated tightening of policy is interpreted as a shift to a more inflation averse policy. Such a shift will imply a period of tighter policy than previously expected, but a quicker return to a neutral stance. Thus, short-term rates will increase in response to the policy innovation, while longer rates fall.~\cite{Ellingsen.2004}\end{quote}

\begin{quote}In Ellingsen and S¨oderstr¨om (2003) we test these theoretical predictions by classifying policy moves in the U.S. as endogenous or exogenous using reports in the \textit{Wall Street Journal. }The results are illustrated in Figure 3. Panel (a) reiterates the results from Figure 1, showing the estimated response of the yield curve to changes in the three-month T-bill rate (our measure of policy innovations) on all days when the Federal Reserve’s target for the federal funds rate was changed from October 1988 to December 2001.8~\cite{Ellingsen.2004}\end{quote}

\begin{quote}after policy moves classified as endogenous, interest rates of all maturities tend to move in the same direction, but after moves classified as exogenous, long and short rates move in opposite directions.10~\cite{Ellingsen.2004}\end{quote}

Idee: es hängt von der Interpretation ab, von der Narration die darum herum aufgebaut wird

\cite{Krosigk.2017} tried to replicate the results using text mining techniques but was unable to do so for the years xxx.

Ellingsen, Söderström and Masseng (2003) run two regressions to test their model of market interest rates and target adjustments. First, they test their theory whether the relationship between long and short rates differs on policy days and non-policy days. For that purpose, they estimate the regression \cite[p. 30]{Krosigk.2017}

$\Delta i^n_t = \alpha + (\beta_n^{NP}d_t^{NP} + \beta_n^{P}d_t^{P})\Delta i^{3m}_t + v_t^n$

H1: for large $n$: $\beta_n^{P}< \beta_n^{NP}$

Secondly, Ellingsen, Söderström and Masseng (ibid.) investigate whether the long and short rates behave differently on policy days classified as endogenous or exogenous as well as whether non-policy days have a similar impact as endogenous policy days. \cite[p. 30]{Krosigk.2017}

$\Delta i^n_t = \alpha + (\beta_n^{NP}d_t^{NP} + \beta_n^{Ex}d_t^{Ex} + \beta_n^{End}d_t^{End})\Delta i^{3m}_t + v_t^n$

H2: for large $n$: $\beta_n^{Ex}<0< \beta_n^{End}$

\section{New Insights Through Narrative Research} \label{NewInsights}

Narratives / interpretation plays a big role in how people react to financial facts.

\begin{quote}In joint work with Goetzmann and Kim (2016), using data from a questionnaire survey I have been conducting with institutional investors and high-income Americans since 1989, we found that these people generally have exaggerated assessments of the risk of a stock market crash, and that these assessments are influenced by the news stories, especially front page stories, that they read. One intriguing finding was that an event such as an earthquake could influence estimations of the likelihood of a stock market crash.~\cite[S.~974]{Shiller.2017}\end{quote}

also kann Textauswertung etwas dazu beitragen, es geht um das Verständnis zu Narrativen - aber jetzt die Frage der Zeitdimension: die Kurse sind innerhalb einer halben Stunden verändert - question: is the narrative really driving the change still or is this rather a case of already observing the result -> we can't explain y by knowing y!

So, use NLP techniques and then model like thus: aber jeder regressor erh;ht nat[rlich das R2]

$\Delta i^n_t = \alpha + (\beta_n^{NP}d_t^{NP} + \beta_n^{N1}d_t^{N1} + \beta_n^{N2}d_t^{N2} + + \beta_n^{N3}d_t^{N3} + ...)\Delta i^{3m}_t + v_t^n$


\cite{Cook.1989} use Wall Street Journal articles, even though they mention the speculative wording of the journals, they try their best ot isolate the facts in the articles, completely ignoring the manner in which the facts are presented> giving example of wording
Even when the facts are not clearly stated, they try to find the facts and approximate them, instead of analyzing what kind of information the public had at its disposal

\cite{Gurkaynak.2004} - here they analyze statements, should I involve that in any way?
